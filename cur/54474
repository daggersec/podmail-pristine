John,
Happy New Year!
Great to see you before the holidays.  Hope you had a fun and relaxing
time, because it will be non-stop from here out.
Thanks for taking the time to meet with us.  We really enjoyed connecting
with you.  This will be an important campaign and we are excited to be a
small part of it.
Keep running.  If you're out here--Oakland Running Festival March 20.  I'll
be doing the half.  It's a blast of a running event.
Best to you,
Quinn
