John, 

If you all decide to recommend Punaro to me for Army Secretary, I will want to interview him again.  I want to talk to him about end strength, the role I expect the Service secretaries to play in the budget and acquisition process and more  -- none of which we discussed in the earlier interview.

I'm happy to have him if that's the way the PE wants to go, but I want to make certain things clear to him.

Bob
