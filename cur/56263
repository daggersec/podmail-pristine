John -=20

Jason Kander served as an Army Intelligence Officer in Afghanistan, =
working to root out corruption in that nation's government. When he came =
home, he got right to work on the same mission in the Missouri State House =
and then as Secretary of State.=20

Now the progressive veteran is running for U.S. Senate in Missouri, where =
he is one of our best pickup opportunities in the campaign to wrest =
control of the Senate from Mitch McConnell.

That's why the Koch Brothers and a Karl Rove-backed group are already =
pouring millions into the race to defeat him.=20

Contribute $21.23 (the average VoteVets donation) to Democrat Jason =
Kander's U.S. Senate campaign to send a new progressive leader to =
Washington, D.C.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/vv-kander

Jason's opponent, Republican Senator Roy Blunt is a Tea Party leader who =
has often sided with those fighting to privatize veterans' health care, =
and cut Social Security benefits for the 1 million veterans who rely on =
them to support themselves and their families.

But more importantly, your contribution to Jason is going to support a =
terrific young, progressive veteran leader who can win this race. But only =
if we all stand behind him today.

Chip in a few bucks to his campaign. It's important.
