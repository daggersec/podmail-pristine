John --

I want to make sure you see the email below from the First Lady =
encouraging you to attend a National Health Care Day of Service event this =
weekend.

Michelle Obama has been a strong proponent of service her whole life -- =
and she knows that the first step to solving America's health care crisis =
is for each of us to roll up our sleeves, and do what we can to improve =
vital health care services for people in need.

This weekend, we'll raise awareness of the urgent need for reform and do =
what we can to help out folks in our area who might otherwise fall through =
the cracks. There's a service event right near you -- sign up to attend =
today:

http://my.barackobama.com/hcserviceattend?zip=3D20016

Thanks for all you do,

Jeremy

Jeremy --

National and community service has been a cornerstone of my life, as I =
know it has been for many Americans. And with the daily struggles now =
confronting so many families, it's especially important for us to reach =
out to one another and offer a helping hand.

I've just launched United We Serve, a national initiative to tackle our =
toughest problems by working hand-in-hand in communities across the =
country. We aim to make a real difference right now and bring more and =
more Americans into a tradition of life-long service to make an even =
greater difference down the road.

I'd like to invite you to be a part of it by joining Organizing for =
America's National Health Care Day of Service this weekend. You can join =
up with other local OFA supporters to help improve health care services in =
your community and make a difference as we work to reform America's health =
care system.

Sign up now to participate in a National Health Care Day of Service event =
this Saturday, June 27th:

http://my.barackobama.com/hcserviceattend

There's an old Thomas Edison quote I've always liked: "Opportunity is =
missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like =
work." It's no secret that our country faces some enormous challenges =
right now, and meeting them will take a lot of hard work. But in that work =
lies an equally great opportunity -- a chance to serve. And I do believe =
the chance to serve is a precious gift indeed.

Service has played a transformative role in my life -- bringing me =
tremendous joy and helping me find the path that led to where I am today. =
As a parent, I believe service is a great way to demonstrate values and to =
teach our children firsthand what it means to commit to a purpose beyond =
ourselves.

It should be a part of everyone's life. From the moment someone can walk =
to the day they leave this planet, service should be a part of how we give =
back, how we say thank you, how we express our gratitude for the lives =
that we've been given.

So I'm deeply honored for this chance to support our United We Serve =
initiative and Organizing for America, and I hope you'll be able to =
participate this weekend. Please sign up now to volunteer at a local =
event:

http://my.barackobama.com/hcserviceattend

Thank you,

First Lady Michelle Obama
