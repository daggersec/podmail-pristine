Susan and Jim
This is the letter I sent to a few friends


As described below, the investigation recently published discusses conflict=
s of interest surrounding NY's Governor Cuomo.  Because the subject of the =
investigation, former director of state operations, Howard Glaser, for reas=
ons which are rather transparent and quite pathetic, chose to attack me per=
sonally, despite the fact that pursuant to the strict policy at ProPublica,=
 no board member knows anything about what the Newsroom is working on prior=
 to publication, I have included the entire text of the memo from ProPublic=
a's president, Dick Tofel. Among other things, it is another sad commentary=
 on the noxious state of politics today. If anything, it demonstrates anew =
the extraordinary importance to our democracy of ProPublica and other simil=
ar news organizations that insist on  reporting the truth, without fear, ab=
out corruption, betrayal of the public trust, the powerful taking advantage=
 of the vulnerable or other improper activities.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
Warm regards
Herb

Subject: new story from ProPublica

Dear ProPublica Directors, We wanted to make sure you saw a story we publis=
hed earlier today on conflicts of interest surrounding NY's Governor Cuomo.=
  The story is here:
http://www.propublica.org/article/who-advised-cuomo-on-mortgage-industry-in=
vestigation-a-mortgage-lobbyist, and was also published by the Albany Times=
 Union, which featured it on its front page this morning.
As you'll see at the bottom of the story, its subject, former director of s=
tate operations Howard Glaser, has mounted a vigorous effort (which continu=
ed today) to deflect attention from our reporting by attacking Herb persona=
lly and completely gratuitously.  I do want to take a moment, on behalf of =
Steve (who's on vacation today) and our whole staff to say how much we appr=
eciate Herb's steadfastness and good humor in the face of such nastiness.  =
One of the keys to building a great news organization is having unswerving =
support from those with ultimate business responsibility-and in our case, t=
hat is all of you on the Board.  This story, of which we're very proud, and=
 on which we continue to report, is another proof of the key role all of yo=
u play in making that possible.  Thanks again to Herb, and to each of you.
Best regards, Dick
