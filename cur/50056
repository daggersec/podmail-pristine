Mr Chairman!

As discussed here are some thoughts for my involvement in the HRC success st=
ory!!

But first here is a little background on me that you may not be aware of exp=
erience wise:

---Ran for Congress in 2000 lost by 3%
---National Finance Chair--Dean for President
---National Treasurer--O'Malley for President
---Maryland State Party Chair where Robby Mook was the coordinated campaign d=
irector
---DNC executive committee and was responsible for Dems overseas where there=
 are today OVER 9,000,000 USA citizens!
---Chief of Staff--Congressman Steny Hoyer
--- best for last!  Brooke Lierman for Delegate where she upset a 22 year in=
cumbent with your help!
--- Vice Chair of the State Chairs association and very close to Ray Buckley=
 now the Chair....
---Convention--Rules Committee and will be a Super Delegate.

SOOO with that in mind and with my volunteering in MANY organizations and wi=
th my background in business, government budgeting and management we should t=
alk about where the following might fit!

---Liaison and outreach to many many ethnic groups, labor where I am close t=
o Trumoka and Hite
---Congress. Am friendly with TONS of members especially in the Black and Hi=
spanic Caucus....not to mention how many other members I worked closely with=
 as Hoyers COS
