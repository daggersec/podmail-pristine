John, I saw Bill at our FYC event in Ft. Myers last week.  He mentioned
he's worked with you on his book, etc.

He wanted to reach out to you to see if he could assist with Hilary
Clinton's campaign.  I told him I'd send you the message and perhaps you
could reach out to him.  I'm never sure who I should share your email with
directly so if you'd prefer I write him and give it to him, let me know.

Otherwise, it is below.

Hope all is well.  Fun reading the great stories out there about you.  We
put the NY Times one in yesterday's Gizmogram.
