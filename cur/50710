Just one last one. We never tested an oil import or export fee, did we?

John, here are the three things =E2=80=93 please let me know what else we c=
an do to
be helpful:

*1*. Anzalone did the Feb 2015 survey.  Survey was done Feb 2015 (1,200
national (including 400 battleground) + 800 IA caucus goers)

*2*. Here are the supporter/opponent arguments from that Feb survey:

*Supporters say a pollution fee is a bi-partisan idea proposed by George
Bush's Treasury Secretary and supported by major CEOs. Supporters say the
fee makes polluters clean up their pollution while providing families with
a rebate of fifteen hundred dollars a year and creating new jobs in clean
energy. Supporters say childhood asthma rates have doubled in the past
thirty years and floods and droughts are already hurting farmers and
driving up food prices. *

*Opponents say that this is the biggest tax increase in history, and will
immediately raise gas and utility prices for families, but won't do
anything about global warming since China and India are polluting more
every year. Opponents say that no rebate is going to make up for families'
higher everyday energy bills, and that we shouldn't be raising taxes for a
pie-in-the-sky plan that won't solve climate change.*

*3*. We did not specifically test the clean power challenge, but got strong
numbers on energy measures that helped everyone feel good about it.  In an
April 2015 Benenson battleground poll, we tested several clean energy
proposals as part of our economic policy survey =E2=80=93 we measured both =
=E2=80=9Cwill
this strengthen the economy=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cwill it help people like =
you get ahead=E2=80=9D.
We then looked to see which proposals tested best across both measures.
This tested very well: *Rebuild our power grids to meet the growing demands
of all our new devices, creating cleaner, high-tech, high-efficiency grids
that can take advantage of both conventional and new sources of power, like
wind and solar.*

Separately, in our economic values battleground poll (March 2015), we
tested =E2=80=9Cwhich of these investments make the economy stronger=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=93 and
included some energy-related economic investments.  These two tested in the
top-tier of investments: *=E2=80=9Cinvesting in infrastructure like rebuild=
ing our
power grid to accommodate all of the electricity we=E2=80=99ll use in the 2=
1st
century economy=E2=80=9D* (88% over all said it would help make the economy
stronger, 59% said it would help a great deal) and a more generic =E2=80=9C=
*investing
in clean energy technology, such as wind, solar and energy efficiency=E2=80=
=9D*
(81% over all support, 53% said a great deal).

Oren,

I am at the White House today and they are playing around with this idea,
so three follow ups:

Whose poll was this?

Can you send me me argumentation that dropped the numbers so much

Do we have comparative numbers for are other proposals like the clean power
challenge?

Here you go John, please let us know if we can get you anything else on
this.

So it starts off with decent numbers but we lose a lot of ground and end up
even after messaging.

*Initial Question & Results*


*There is currently a proposal to reduce the amount of carbon pollution
released into our air by putting a carbon pollution tax on companies that
extract or import fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas. The money
raised would be used provide a refund check for fifteen hundred dollars a
year per family to offset higher energy costs. *
Support vs. Oppose:

National: 58-35

Battleground: 59-33

Iowa Caucus Goers: 75-17

*After arguments on both sides*

National: 46-45

Battleground: 46-43

Iowa Caucus Goers: 68-23
