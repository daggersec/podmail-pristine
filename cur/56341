July has been another busy month for Secretary Clinton's programs at the Cl=
inton Foundation.  Here are some of the highlights:

Too Small to Fail<http://toosmall.org/>

 *   As you may remember in March, Secretary Clinton launched the Too Small=
 to Fail cities strategy in Tulsa, Oklahoma to test and scale impactful mes=
sages and interventions promoting early talking at a local level.  Continui=
ng that effort, last week in Oakland, California, Secretary Clinton partici=
pated in a round table discussion with local business and community leaders=
, including the Bay Area Council, UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland =
and Kaiser Permanente, to launch a city-wide campaign in Oakland to help pa=
rents and caregivers support their children's early language development. T=
he multi-platform campaign, made possible by a gift from Marc Benioff, CEO =
of Salesforce.com, includes: television commercials and radio spots; messag=
ing on billboards and bus shelters; an infant/toddler "talking is teaching"=
 themed clothing line; a local text messaging program with resources and ti=
ps; and a Sesame Street parent toolkit.



 *   Too Small to Fail is actively engaging hospitals, one of the most crit=
ical touch points for new parents, in this important effort.  UCSF Benioff =
Children's Hospital will create a pilot program on how hospitals can addres=
s the word gap as a health issue and Kaiser Permanente will distribute Too =
Small to Fail resources to all parents of newborns in their medical center =
in Oakland.  You can read an article about the launch HERE<http://www.mercu=
rynews.com/ci_26203994/oakland-hillary-clinton-launches-campaign-that-recom=
mends-reading>, watch a local news report HERE<http://www.ktvu.com/news/new=
s/local/clinton-launches-baby-talking-campaign-oakland/ngmWp/?__federated=

urynews.com/2014/07/23/photos-hillary-rodham-clinton-visits-childrens-hospi=
tal-oakland-research-institute/#1>.

In addition to the announcement, Secretary Clinton convened the Too Small t=
o Fail Advisory and Leadership Councils, including members Cindy McCain, Kr=
is Perry of the First Five Years Fund, Dr. Nadine Burke Harris of the Cente=
r for Youth Wellness, and former Senator Bill Frist, for a substantive disc=
ussion around our first year accomplishments and future plans.


 *   Earlier this month, Too Small to Fail announced a new partnership with=
 ESSENCE Magazine to promote early vocabulary development among African-Ame=
rican children ages 0 to 5 across ESSENCE's media platforms, from online an=
d print content to special events.  The partnership was launched at the ESS=
ENCE Festival in New Orleans and Disney Junior's Doc McStuffins was on-hand=
, along with a local pediatrician, to lead special literacy activities for =
kids.  This builds on our strategy, which began in February with the launch=
 of our Univision partnership, to form national media partnerships to help =
reach targeted audiences.  You can read about the launch event HERE<http://=
www.essence.com/2014/07/03/essence-and-clinton-foundation-announce-new-educ=
ation-partnership>.


No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project<http://www.clintonfoundation.or=
g/our-work/no-ceilings-full-participation-project>

*         On July 17, President Clinton hosted the fifth event in the No Ce=
ilings conversation series, "Entrepreneurship In Action."  He led discussio=
ns with a group of 100 women in Lucknow, India who participate in self-help=
 groups which provide microfinance, education, and training. The financial =
independence and economic empowerment these women achieve as part of these =
groups help them gain influence and become leaders in their families and th=
eir communities. You can read an article from Fortune about the event and t=
he work of No Ceilings HERE<http://fortune.com/2014/07/17/india-bill-hillar=
y-clinton/> and you can see the Secretary's tweet about the event HERE<http=
s://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/490136058818883584>.

Youth Employment<http://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative=
/campaigns/job-one>

*         Following Secretary Clinton's CGI America announcement of Job One=
<http://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/campaigns/job-o=
ne>, a far-reaching set of CGI commitments on youth employment, the CGI com=
mitment makers have continued to generate public attention and interest for=
 this work.  For example, companies like MDC Partners and Symantec have put=
 up social media posts to amplify Secretary Clinton's announcement (viewed =
HERE<http://mdccares.com/2014/06/27/mdc-partners-makes-clinton-global-initi=
ative-commitment-to-action-in-partnership-with-year-up/> and HERE<http://ww=
w.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-launches-cyber-career-connection-sc3-=
initiative-develop-cybersecurity-careers-young-0>), and others, like the Sm=
all Business Majority, continue to recruit additional business owners to cr=
eate new youth training, hiring or mentoring opportunities (viewed HERE<htt=

Too Small to Fail

Oakland: Hillary Clinton launches campaign that recommends reading aloud to=
 children from birth
By  Samantha Clark
July 23, 2014
Oakland Tribune

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton helped launch a campaign aim=
ed at encouraging parents to read aloud to infants from birth at the UCSF B=
enioff Children's Hospital Oakland on Wednesday.

The campaign, called Talking is Teaching: Talk, Read, Sing, is based on the=
 increasingly recognized importance of brain development that occurs within=
 the first three years of a child's life.

As constant reinforcement, its message will broadcast in Oakland on billboa=
rds, radio and television and even through text messages. Parents and careg=
ivers can get a teaching tool kit from Sesame Street and baby clothes made =
by Oaklandish.

"A parent is a child's first teacher, and a family is a child's first schoo=
l," Clinton said. "And we want to let every parent in Oakland and the Bay A=
rea know you can actually build a smarter child, increase brain development=
 by doing our simple, low-cost activities."

Plopping a child in front of a television will not cut it, but the simple a=
ctions of talking, reading and singing to a child enhance important communi=
cation skills. Even talking about a bus ride or about the colors in a book =
helps bridge the reading gap that quickly widens between children from low-=
income and more affluent families.

Research found that by the age of 4, children of affluent parents have hear=
d 30 million more words than children of low-income, less educated parents,=
 who fall behind in building a vocabulary.

Children in low-income families can speak 500 words by their fourth birthda=
y compared to 700 words for a child from a working-class family and 1,100 f=
or a child from a professional family.

According to a March survey of Oakland families, less than half of low-inco=
me parents reported telling a story to their child or singing to their chil=
d daily, and only 52 percent read to their child daily.

"Behind these numbers are real families that are struggling and real childr=
en who are missing out on what their families could do for them," Clinton s=
aid of the findings.

Oakland is a pilot community for the effort because of its diversity and ch=
allenges. The city has a strong network of leaders interested in early lite=
racy.

"We're trying to solve a pretty big problem," said Jim Wunderman, president=
 and CEO of Bay Area Council, a local business group and campaign partner. =
He said that supporting early education leads to a new generation of invent=
ion and progress.

Oakland and Tulsa, Okla., where the program rolled out last March, hopefull=
y will become models for implementing the program in other communities acro=
ss the nation, including San Francisco and San Jose, said Ann O'Leary, dire=
ctor of Too Small Too Fail, the initiative behind the campaign that is a pa=
rtnership between San Francisco-based Next Generation and the Bill, Hillary=
 and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.

"Here in Oakland, we really want to get it right," O'Leary said. "We want t=
o over the next couple years focus on how to increase awareness."

Local groups and resources, such as religious organizations, libraries and =
health care providers are distributing educational campaign materials to th=
e community. Partner Kaiser Permanente is giving them to the parents of 2,1=
00 new babies born in its Oakland medical center and at its well-baby visit=
s.

"If successful, we would spread this across other Kaiser facilities across =
the nation and hope to expand the program," said Janet Liang, chief operati=
ng officer for Kaiser Permanente Northern California.

UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital, also a partner, is running a more targete=
d campaign through pediatric visits that will be evaluated in order to crea=
te a model for other hospitals, O'Leary said.

To mark the start of the campaign, a citywide baby shower with entertainmen=
t and educational activities is being held at Oakland's Fairyland at 10 a.m=
. Thursday.

"To see a child's face light up is reward enough, but to know that it's not=
 only their faces but their brains (that) light up is an extraordinary sens=
e of empowerment that through their families, we want to convey," Clinton s=
aid.

No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project

Bill Clinton visits India to take on women's rights
By Sarah Robbins
July 17, 2014
Fortune

The former president visited India to highlight the immense economic challe=
nges facing the nation's women and the need for reform.

India may now be the world's third-largest economy, but the majority of its=
 women still remain behind closed doors.

Earlier on Thursday, when former President Bill Clinton (No. 5 on Fortune's=
 World's Greatest Leaders list) met with 20 women entrepreneurs in northern=
 India, he opened up a dialogue about access and opportunity. He also put a=
 human face on the Clinton Foundation's women's rights data collection and =
awareness initiative, No Ceilings, which will turn out a progress report ea=
rly next year on the status of women around the world.

"I chose this venue because so many Indian women are working to empower the=
mselves through entrepreneurship and education, information technology, and=
 microcredit," President Clinton told Fortune, via email, from Lucknow, the=
 capital of Uttar Pradesh. "I want to hear from them about what we can do t=
o provide more support for meeting their challenges and seizing their oppor=
tunities."

The challenges are immense for this nation of 1.2 billion, where, according=
 to the World Bank, women make up 29% of the workforce-the lowest portion o=
f any of the BRICS nations. India's record on women's rights and safety is =
arguably even more dismal: the National Crime Records Bureau recently repor=
ted that, on average, 92 women were raped in India every day last year.

Thursday's event was Clinton's first official appearance in support of No C=
eilings and the program's first women's rights dialogue in the developing w=
orld. He met women who are part of self-help groups that provide microfinan=
ce, education, and training. (These groups have teamed up with the Clinton =
Foundation on a massive, Ikea-sponsored health initiative that educates com=
munities on the importance of using oral rehydration salts to treat diarrhe=
a-a preventable disease that kills 200,000 Indian children every year.)

Some of these women say that they were once forced by their families to sta=
y in their own homes. One, for years, was known only by her husband's name.=
 Now, after taking part in the group, she owns her own furniture business a=
nd her own cow, according to the Clinton Foundation. Her kids are going to =
school-sharing their English and computer knowledge with her-and are poised=
 for a better life than she once expected.

It almost goes without saying how striking these women's experiences differ=
 from that of Hillary Clinton, whose current book tour continues to stoke w=
ill-she-or-won't-she presidential speculation. The No Ceilings project is v=
ery much a Clinton family affair and was one of three projects that the for=
mer U.S. Secretary of State brought to the foundation last year, after the =
end of her term.

No Ceilings' upcoming report, which will be published in partnership with t=
he Gates Foundation and with support from Microsoft, will compile data from=
 sources like the World Bank and the United Nations. "We hope it will show,=
 in a powerful way, that women's full participation is not just a nice thin=
g to do but a right thing to do," says Maura Pally, executive director of t=
he office of Hillary Clinton. "Our hope is that [the data shows that] count=
ries where full participation indicators are higher are ultimately more eco=
nomically successful countries."

Personal narratives like those shared on Thursday are crucial to the effort=
, says Pally. "Sometimes data on paper, or laws on the books, may reflect w=
hat is perceived as equality," she says, "but barriers exist on the ground.=
"

Indeed, public harassment, inadequate policing, and a broken legal system a=
re just some of the roadblocks to equality cited by Indian women's rights a=
ctivists, who are now lobbying newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi t=
o make equal protection a top priority. Last week, when India's new governm=
ent released its first official budget, it included about 3 billion rupees =
for programs to guarantee women's rights and safety; time will tell whether=
 these programs translate into increased opportunity and access.

"No Ceilings is about first understanding the status of rights and opportun=
ities for women and girls around the world and then focusing on closing wha=
t gaps exist," says Chelsea Clinton, who has hosted No Ceilings conversatio=
ns in New York, Ireland, and Denver. "In order to do both, everyone, includ=
ing men and boys must be engaged in this effort. My father leading this con=
versation in India, underscores that gender equality isn't just a women's i=
ssue, but a global issue that has long term impact on health, peace and pro=
sperity around the world."
