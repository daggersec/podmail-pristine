THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: THE DEMOCRATS: SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS OF VE=
RMONT

Senator Bernie Sanders has a noble cause i.e.to expand Medicare for all Ame=
ricans , to provide free government funded college tuitions at public colle=
ges  for all who want to go,  expand social security, infrastructure fundin=
g of roads and bridges, all for a minimal cost of $18 trillion .  Add that =
number to an already existing $18 t  federal debt and the appearance in fro=
nt of a federal bankruptcy court would not be needed since the court would =
eventually be non-existent. Healthcare at $15 trillion, we would have to re=
name OBAMACARE  as BERNIECARE[Sure President Obama would support that] . It=
 is simply not even remotely economically feasible in both in  healthcare a=
nd administrative costs. How will we pay for it? Not the only rich but midd=
le class tax increases for all. Furthermore where is his economic  growth  =
plan in order to pay these increases. Print more money !You see, NOTHING IS=
 FREE. You will pay one way or another. Read about BERNIECARE and his other=
 programs of fiscal irresponsibility and you will stick a fork in his chanc=
es of gaining the Democratic Presidential nomination. Perhaps the Senator s=
hould take a sabbatical in Greece for a year and learn what happens when hu=
man entrepreneurialism is reduced to a lack of human self-respect and pover=
ty. Independent Bernie Sanders is obviously heading toward a 3 rd. party ru=
n...
Imagine A LIFE under  Bernie`s America for  YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES?  Book yo=
ur flight to Athens .
