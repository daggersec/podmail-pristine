Tell the big ten retailers to take toxic chemicals out of their stores! Add your name to our petition for safe products here: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=b9Wl3Ch1pX2M2nK_bSSiDw

John,

Want to keep harmful chemicals out of our everyday products? Sign our petition to the big ten retailers to keep toxic chemicals off the shelves: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=kmERHwpHyFTZDxwvSj8uwA .

When you stopped at Walgreens or CVS to grab a bottle of shampoo, did anyone tell you that it could contain cancer-causing chemicals? Have you checked if that shirt you bought at Costco is kept wrinkle-free by formaldehyde? Do you know if that couch you bought at Target or Walmart is releasing chemicals that could harm your children's mental development?

Most of the time, I don't. It's impossible to know all the right questions to ask when we go to the store to keep ourselves and our families safe. And frankly, it shouldn't be our job.

The stores where we shop should watch out for us by asking their suppliers to keep toxic chemicals out of their products. But they won't do it unless we make them.

Sign our petition urging the big ten retailers to keep products with toxic chemicals off their shelves now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=wYtiAu7RmeJj3z47vM-2gQ .

Today, we're joining with the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families coalition to launch a campaign called "Mind the Store," which asks ten major retailers to protect us by keeping the Hazardous 100+ toxic chemicals out of their products.

Retailers are often stuck in the same place we are. Our broken federal laws mean they have limited access to basic health and safety information on toxic chemicals sold in their very own stores.

But they have the power to ask the questions and make the demands to keep us safe. If they hear from enough of their customers, the ten major retailers will tell their suppliers to take these Hazardous 100+ chemicals out of their products.

Today is the day we REALLY start to move the marketplace, and we can do this with your help.

Take action and sign on to our letter today -- with one click you can send your message to the big ten -- it's time to "Mind the Store!": http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Aq6Z5rQSa5qgh2Ad0vQ4DA .

Yesterday, Senators Frank Lautenberg (NJ) and Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) re-introduced the Safe Chemicals Act to fix our broken chemical laws in this country. We're grateful to our allies for taking on this critical issue and we look forward to helping pass it. But we don't have to wait for progress in Washington to start making our stores and homes safer.

With your voice and the thousands of others dedicated to creating safer chemicals that will lead to healthier families, we can create real change and accountability for the suppliers now and make sure our neighbors are minding their stores: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=K3Vx_LrSjvYvbdVE5QfJjw .
