John --

Remember when getting an elected official to even mention
carbon pollution or climate change was a big deal? We've
come a long way.

Today, the momentum for action has never been greater.
Climate change denial in America is at an all-time low, and
hundreds of companies have come out to support rules on
power plant pollution. As if that wasn't enough, religious
leaders like Pope Francis are insisting that there is a
moral obligation to address climate change.

In just two weeks, more than 160 nations, representing more
than 90 percent of the world's carbon pollution, are joining
together for an international conference to tackle climate
change, while we still can.

John, success on this issue is far from guaranteed.
While the international community is finally coming together
to act, there are still members of Congress trying to hold
back progress.

Climate change deniers are trying to spoil this big moment
by undermining America's commitment to act on climate
change. Join OFA in standing up to deniers and protecting
our progress:

https://my.barackobama.com/Support-Global-Action-On-Climate-Change

Some senators, like James Inhofe and Mitch McConnell, are
going out of their way to undermine American commitments.
Senator Inhofe, famous for bringing a snowball onto the
Senate floor as proof that climate change doesn't exist, has
committed to crash the talks and be a "one-man truth squad,"
telling the international negotiators how little he believes
in climate science.=20

Senator Inhofe isn't alone. Back at home, climate change=20
deniers in both chambers of Congress are working to=20

Americans deserve better. We deserve responsible leaders=20

Join OFA in calling out climate change deniers, so the U.S.
