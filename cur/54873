om</a>&gt;<br><br><br>Amanda,<br>
Happy to do this. But this should be more than a Colorado piece.<br>
<br>
=C2=A0For context, Senators Kennedy and McCain and I worked very hard to pa=
ss comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate in 2006. Hillary was very=
 supportive and a leader in these efforts. The legislation died in the Repu=
blican controlled House despite the strong push from President Bush. We tri=
ed again in 2007.<br>
<br>
I do not know Senator&#39;s Sanders history on the matter, so it would be v=
ery useful for our HRC team to get me a background piece on Bernie&#39;s ac=
tivity and votes over the years on comprehensive immigration reform. Then w=
e can draft an oped that is supportive of Secretary Clinton&#39;s approach =
to immigration reform, and contrast her efforts to Bernie&#39;s. The piece =
can then be used in other States, besides Colorado-e.g., Nevada, Texas, Flo=
rida, etc.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
