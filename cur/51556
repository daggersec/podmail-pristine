Olmstead 15th Anniversary [Part Three] - How Much Progress Has Your State Made?  Information Bulletin # 392 (6/2014).

In this Olmstead 15th Anniversary Information Bulletin, we will compare the Medicaid expenditures State-by-State for Long Term 
Services and Supports (LTSS), including expenditures on both nursing homes (institutions) and community-based programs.

In Fiscal Year 2000, the first year after the Supreme Court held that unnecessary isolation=E2=80=9D was discrimination against 
people with disabilities. States varied quite a lot in the percentage of their LTSS spending that went to the community-based 
programs.  Nationally, only 18.7% of LTSS spending went to the community-based programs and the remainder went to programs that 
segregate people with disabilities in nursing homes.  The worst States in 2000, those that expended less than 10% of their LTSS 
in the community were Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana (5.7%), Mississippi (6.7%), New Hampshire, North Dakota (3.4%), Pennsylvania 
(3.2%), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee (0.5%), Utah, and Wyoming.  Chart One below lists the rates for each State.


By FY 2012, the percentage of Medicaid LTSS expenditures in the community had increased to 38.8%.  There were only four States 
that had under 10% Medicaid community-based expenditures: Alabama, Indiana, Kentucky, and South Dakota. However, another four 
States were listed as having zero expenditure in the community: Arizona, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Tennessee.  Chart Two below 
lists the rates for each State.

By FY 2012, many of the worst States from FY 2000 had made really significant progress in funding community-based services, 
including, Illinois, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania. The improvement in these States demonstrates a real commitment to 
changing their allocations to comply with Olmstead.

Obviously, there has been a lot of progress.  However, it is important to understand that the spending on the institutional side 
of the leger has not been stationary between FY 2000 and FY 2012.  In terms of total Medicaid dollar expenditures during these 
years, the institutional and community sides each increased by $12 billion.  Chart three below lists the increases in each 
State.

What is particularly interesting about the total dollar expenditures is that some States that decreased their total combined 
institutional and nursing home expenditures between FY 2000 and FY 2012 were also able to increase their total community-based 
Medicaid expenditures.  These States, which should receive exceptional kudos, include Minnesota (reduced institutional 
expenditures by $32 m and increased community by $1 b), Nebraska (reduced institutional expenditures by $21 m and increased 
community by $13 m), New Mexico (reduced institutional expenditures by $162 m and increased community by $7 m), Pennsylvania 
(reduced institutional expenditures by $231 m and increased community by $737 m), Tennessee (reduced institutional expenditures 
by $72 m and also decreased community by $6 m).

However, there were States that increased their total institutional expenditures and while actually reducing their 
community-based expenditures between FY 2000 and FY 2012.  These States, were Connecticut (increased institutional expenditures 
by $273 m and decreased community by $16 m), Kentucky (increased institutional expenditures by $284 m and decreased community by 
$70 m), Rhode Island (increased institutional expenditures by $75 m and decreased community by $20 m).

We are very disappointed and surprised with those States that have actually decreased their total Medicaid expenditures for 
community-based programs. How can they be complying with the Olmstead decision?  Are all of the people with disabilities who 
want to live in the community able to do so?  Are there any people with disabilities still at risk of unnecessary isolation?  
What about those States that in FY 2012 still spent less than 10% of their LTSS on community-based services?  How do they comply 
with Olmstead? How do they prevent unnecessary isolation?

What are the advocates for the aging and the advocates for physically disabled people doing in those States?  It is difficult to 
believe that States are complying with the Olmstead and the ADA when they are spending such a small percentage of their LTSS on 
community-based programs.

It is difficult to reconcile a commitment to ending unnecessary isolation with many States increased spending on institutions 
that segregate people with disabilities.  Advocates for the aging and physically disabled people regardless of their ages must 
speak up and demand full compliance with Olmstead and a real commitment to community-based programs.
