I would say that if there's a bank that needs to be broken up she needs a
glass steagall tool to break them up. She can't really do that now.

However, I'm open to saying a pattern of too much complexity. So it's
finding several banks. But I'm trying to find a debate answer not a policy
rollout. Happy to think longer for that kind of answer.

Obviously she can't break up any bank on her own. The higher cap
requirements are designed to assure much less likelihood of failure. We
have pushed for higher ones. But we live in a quandary which is no one
knows what any of this means and glass steagall has the most resonance with
reporters and the like.

I get Jamie Damon's argument that having both sides of the business helped
him weather the storm. They took profits and losses at different times. But
I think there are some reasonable people on Wall Street who think the
complexity is a problem.
