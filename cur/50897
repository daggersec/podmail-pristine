When Hillary Clinton said she was going to hit the road, she meant it.

The newly declared presidential candidate is on her way to Iowa, from New Y=
ork, in a van after announcing her candidacy online Sunday afternoon.



The former secretary of state, who is trying to become the first female pre=
sident, is set to appear in Iowa =E2=80=94 the influential early-voting sta=
te =E2=80=94 on Tuesday for a series of small, private events.

While she has no planned stops on her road trip =E2=80=94 which was her own=
 idea =E2=80=94 the candidate stopped by a gas station in Pennsylvania on S=
unday.

Clinton=E2=80=99s much-anticipated launch came in the form of a web video o=
n Sunday afternoon, ending months of speculation about her intentions. Her =
campaign kick-off is expected to include a series of low-key events with pr=
ivate citizens, as opposed to large speeches =E2=80=94 and her road trip re=
flects that plan. The presumptive Democratic front-runner is not planning a=
ny major speeches or campaign rallies until May.
