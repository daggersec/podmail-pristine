It was good to see you at LinkedIn.

I know this may be a stretch for Hillary, both in terms of timing, and poss=
ibly priorities, but I thought I'd ask what you think.

I'm working to develop a new event about technology and the future of the e=
conomy, tentatively entitled WTF? (What's the Future? :-) in San Francisco =
November 12-13, which I'm co-hosting with Andy McAfee of MIT, co-author of =
the book The Second Machine Age. My ideas are also deeply influenced by Nic=
k Hanauer, who I think CAP may have worked with on some of the concepts of =
Middle Out Economics.

Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft), Andy Rubin, Reid Hoffman, Evan Williams o=
f Twitter and Medium, Travis Kalanick of Uber, Logan Green of Lyft, and man=
y others have agreed to join the program.  I'm also in conversations with o=
ther business leaders from outside Silicon Valley, including Jeff Immelt at=
 GE, Tom Pritzker at Hyatt and Howard Schultz at Starbucks (with whom I wor=
ked on a Markle report about the future of the economy, which was one of th=
e triggers for this event.)

It's shaping up to be a great event.

Seeing some of the back and forth between Hillary and Elizabeth Warren, and=
 the importance of understanding the future of the economy, especially how =
technology is changing the job market, I had this thought that this might b=
e a really interesting venue for Hillary to make an appearance.  The event =
will feature a lot of Silicon Valley heavy hitters (and we might even be ab=
le to organize a fundraiser at the same time), and I think that it's import=
ant that folks out in the Valley hear Hillary's message.  (For what it's wo=
rth, Elizabeth Warren is speaking at the Re/Code event in June, which will =
be targeted at somewhat the same audience.)

Let me know if this is worth pursuing.  I'm also wondering if there is anyo=
ne involved with the Middle Out Economics effort at CAP that I ought to be =
reaching out to.

Thanks.

For reference, I've included a brief summary outlining some of the themes a=
nd focus of the program below.

WTF?

The first industrial revolution led to profound economic disruption, follow=
ed only decades later by a century of enormous progress and prosperity.  No=
w, in the second industrial revolution, led by remarkable new progress in d=
igital technology, we are once again facing an immense social transformatio=
n in the nature of work. New kinds of automation are removing or redefining=
 white collar jobs, and digital technology, culture, as business models per=
vade not only media but every kind of business. At the same time, innovatio=
n will create undreamed of new kinds of jobs, as technology is harnessed to=
 make humans more productive, and able to tackle the world's great challeng=
es.

Technological progress changes the business world, and the world. Steam pow=
er gave us factories, railroads, and industrial capitalism. Electricity ush=
ered in the assembly line, the elevator, and movie stars. Internal combusti=
on led to cars, jets, suburbs, and beach vacations.

So far the digital revolution has given us etail, warehouse robots, artific=
ial intelligence, and the peer economy. And it's only just getting started.

We all believe that the biggest changes are still ahead, and that every ind=
ustry and every organization will have to transform itself in the next few =
years, in multiple ways, or fade away. But until now there's been no event =
dedicated to these changes -- no focused, high-level conversation about the=
 deep ways in which computers and their kin are transforming how we do busi=
ness, how we work, and how we live. Just about everyone's asking WTF? ("wha=
t's the future?"), but answers have been hard to come by.

That's why we're launching WTF? as an executive level event, similar in sty=
le to O'Reilly's past Web 2.0 Summit, which provided clarity and focus to t=
he transformation of Silicon Valley after the dotcom bust.  Our goal is to =
shed light on the transformation in the nature of work now being driven by =
algorithms, big data, robotics, and the emerging peer economy.

WTF is where the geeks meet the suits, and where the incumbents and upstart=
s come together to talk about what's happening, and more importantly what's=
 going to happen. Our speakers include Silicon Valley visionaries and high =
tech CEOs, and also leaders from the rest of the economy: the industries th=
at are being transformed by technological progress. We'll also hear from th=
e top academics and other thought leaders who study these issues. And we'll=
 highlight sharp new talent -- people you might not have heard of before wh=
o are doing amazing things.

Some of the themes we are exploring include:

AI and white collar jobs (The Race Against the Machine)

Advanced manufacturing and re-shoring

Augmented Reality in the Workplace

Networks and the Nature of the Firm (the Uber/AirBnb Economy)

Workers in a world of "continuous partial employment"

Security in a connected world

The data-driven business

The attention economy

The event will be held November 12 and 13 at the Palace Hotel in San Franci=
sco.  Attendance will be by invitation only, and is expected to consist of =
approximately 1000 senior executives, VCs, policy-makers, and entrepreneurs=
.
