I would say no and say that this 1930's policy solution doesn't work in
this century.  And it wouldn't have done anything about AIG, Lehman or many
other too big to fail failures.

Gene's artful version still gets us to no.

I am saying she says some version of I will fix the problem w out it. But
if it makes sense to do bc of issues that arise - e g too much complexity
to manage - then she will do it. She's not saying she will do it now. She's
not saying it was responsible for the crisis. But she will reinstate if
future need arises.

I guess I worry about everyone else up on the stage saying reinstate glass
steagall and not giving her more.

I recognize I'm in a different place than others. You may not want to go
this far, but given her anxiety on Glass Steagall I did want to offer up an
alternative.
