Hope WSJ story is wrong citing you as a major advocate of HRC making a forma=
l announcement
of candidacy in April.  Setting up a legal entity to accept donations?  Yes.=
 Major policy addresses
in prestigious settings staking out important positions?  Definitely.  A for=
mal announcement of
her candidacy in April?  That just makes her one of 14 candidates, looking h=
yper-political when
it would be better for her to be elevated and above the petty politics for a=
s long as possible. The
minute she formally announces she will have to publicly comment or publicly d=
ecline to comment
on every word Obama says and every action any Democrat takes....while every c=
onsultant will
also be commenting to every reporter on her behalf whether they speak for he=
r or not.....the
tendency after an early announcement would be to diminish her into another c=
andidate....the
more elevated she acts, the better for her....I get the money angle for a co=
mmittee, and I darn
well get the major policy addresses.....I don't get the early announcement i=
dea at all.....
