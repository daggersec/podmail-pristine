What i don't like about Bernie is that he has hardly anything good to =
say about America. He sounds like Trump. America is in such bad shape.

But America has strongest economy in the world, best schools in the =
world, best hospitals in the world, best science and technology in the =
world. Capitalism works. We are not a socialist society. Although  every =
system needs checks and balances. Wall Street is the engine that runs =
our economy. Its not all bad. Even fire can be destructive if its =
mishandled=85 but properly controlled, we can't be productive without =
it.=
