Friend,

Hey, what's on your calendar for Sunday, January 20?

How about a fabulous brunch with amazing Democratic women -- where you and a friend are the VIP guests and sharing a table with newly-sworn-in senator Elizabeth Warren?

That's right, you and a guest could be discussing hot topics with some of the country's top women leaders.Â  All you have to do is enter our Strength in Numbers Contest -- the winner gets 2 VIP tickets to our EMILY's List 2013 Inauguration Brunch in Washington, DC. We'll take care of everything -- your flight, hotel, the works.

http://click.email.emilyslist.org/?qs=ff1b814ac3ebb95df11c47102d6c3ec16452851848dc88659425dd210d9b9e5a 
Just add your name right now and you'll be automatically entered. The contest closes in just 18 days, so don't delay.

EMILY's List is celebrating an historic year for electing pro-choice, Democratic women candidates. It's the soul of what we do and it was an amazing year for it. From Elizabeth Warren to Tammy Baldwin to Claire McCaskill to Tammy Duckworth to Ann Kirkpatrick to Cheri Bustos -- all in all, we helped elect nine women senators, eighteen congresswomen, and the country's only Democratic woman governor. More than 2 million EMILY's List members raised $51.2 million to elect pro-choice, Democratic women. That's why we're so thrilled to offer this opportunity. You deserve it.

Your hard work and dedication made this historic election possible -- and this is our chance to show our appreciation.

Don't miss this chance to join this once-in-a-lifetime event. Sign up now and automatically enter to win. 

Thanks for everything -- and I hope to see you in Washington next month!
