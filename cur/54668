Seher and John,

Hope you're both doing well. We're both stressed and excited here in Kansas
and are getting our final budget hammered out. The late Dr. George Tiller's
daughter, Rebecca Tiller-Bunting, is eager to make some phone calls on my
behalf and we're trying to dig and find some people she could ring to help
support our efforts.

Do any good people come to mind?

Thanks to you both!
