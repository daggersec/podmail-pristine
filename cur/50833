Mike & Co.,

The busiest week of the session so far was John Boehner's last as Speaker.  A=
mid the speakership transition, several big-ticket fiscal and financial item=
s moved.  What happened and where they stand, ex. the budget, in brief round=
up below.  As always, contact me for clarification, elaboration, etc. =20

Great weekends all and let's go Mets...

Dana

-------------

Highway Bill Reauthorization was extended through November 20 by voice vote i=
n the Senate.  Next week, the House will consider a six-year bill cleared by=
 the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee this week.   Staffers=
 are still putting together final provisions.=20

NB:   Expect the House bill to include the Fed dividend offset.   Per a form=
er staffer following transportation:  "There aren=E2=80=99t a whole lot of o=
ptions out there and right now transportation is very popular and banks aren=
=E2=80=99t. It remains unlikely to come out of the bill because it would be h=
ard to replace it on such short notice."

Ex-Im will be resuscitated, joining on the highway bill ride.  A majority of=
 GOP House l members voted (313-118 overall) this week to reauthorize the Ba=
nk.  It might added to the highway bill when  that train pulls into Conferen=
ce station.=20

=E2=80=A2  FRB Rate Policy was left unchanged  on Wednesday.  The explicit r=
eference added to the next meeting effectively meant the Fed's decisions abo=
ut rates are now being made on a meeting-to-meeting basis, though Fed offici=
als stopped short of committing to an immediate move.=20

Officials struck from the statement a sentence introduced in September that p=
ointed to market turbulence and global developments as potential restraints o=
n U.S. economic activity.  That reduces an impediment officials had stressed=
 in September as standing in their way.

=E2=80=A2. 3Q15 GDP 1.5% -- a significant slowing from 3.9 percent growth in=
 the second quarter.  But the details of the report were much better than th=
e headline. Inventories subtracted 1.4 percent from growth, the biggest drag=
.  Waning international appetite for American-made goods held back economic g=
rowth during the third quarter -- the poor performance of exports throughout=
 the year has forced businesses to slash their inventories.

=E2=80=A2. Tax extenders have been off the radar for a while but look intact=
 this year.  They are likely ro ride the highway bill or December's omnibus a=
ppropriations bill. =20

There's strong bipartisan support in both houses for the largest ones -- R&D=
, Section 179 depreciation, S&L sales tax deduction, bonus depreciation, Sub=
part F exemption for active financing, CFC look-through, depreciation for re=
tail and restaurant improvements, and the deduction for teacher expenses.  T=
he rest will probably make it in the end, as in the Senate Finance Committee=
 passed two-year $96 billion bill extending 52 provisions.=20
