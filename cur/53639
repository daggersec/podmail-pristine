Hi John and Heather:  I'd like to make sure we're all on the same page abou=
t an issue that has arisen around the Distributional National Accounts (DIN=
A) project.  I'm available for a quick call, if that would be easiest.

Let me just lay out some background and my recommendation.

As we know, WCEG is developing a communications and outreach plan, in colla=
boration with Emmanuel, around DINA.  I recently learned that Emmanuel and =
Gabriel Zucman have submitted a proposal to INET for $200K to support DINA =
research, and INET then turned around and asked the Sandler Foundation to f=
und half of that work.  Emmanuel has not heard back yet from INET, but thin=
ks INET will make a decision in the next month.  I want to check in with yo=
u because the Sandler Foundation's decision around INET's "ask" of us could=
 have some bearing on WCEG.

The overarching question is whether WCEG's plans regarding the DINA project=
, and its desire to be associated with DINA-related releases when GDP data =
come out, might be harmed if third parties like INET provided research supp=
ort for DINA and/or made public announcements or press releases about their=
 support of DINA.  Would third party actions adversely affect WCEG's organi=
zational objectives to disseminate the DINA results using an "equitable gro=
wth" frame?

I spoke with Emmanuel this afternoon to get his perspective.


*         Emmanuel is quite clear that his research around DINA, particular=
ly as to the US, emanated out of the Berkeley Center for Equitable Growth t=
hat we fund, and he is quite happy to collaborate with WCEG on the communic=
ations of the DINA work and he supports use of an "equitable growth" frame =
around that.



*         He favors the idea of a broader group of funders supporting DINA =
researching generally.  He notes that the World Top Incomes Database that P=
iketty, Saez, Atkinson and others launched has been funded by a range of fu=
nders (including the Berkeley Center, INET and others) and is now evolving =
to add DINA data worldwide; the database will be renamed the "World Wealth =
and Income Database" with the ultimate goal to enable governments to publis=
h their own DINAs all over the world.  In other words, there have already b=
een (and will continue to be) a variety of funders supporting DINA-related =
research.  Emmanuel notes that he has also talked to Arnold Foundation and =
the National Science Foundation about support for research projects relatin=
g to DINA.

As to the specific DINA research proposal in front of INET right now, my re=
commendation is that we have INET and the Berkeley Center split the cost of=
 the DINA research project (with the Sandler Foundation giving our $100K di=
rectly to the Berkeley Center rather than through INET).  As part of that d=
iscussion with INET, I would propose to communicate with them that we have =
been supporting DINA since its inception out of the Berkeley Center and tha=
t we envision the Berkeley Center continuing to support DINA work, as well =
as noting that WCEG already has plans to collaborate with Emmanuel in a bro=
ader communications and dissemination strategy about the DINA work.  This f=
eels like a straightforward way to maintain a clear lineage to DINA through=
 the Berkeley Center and to the "equitable growth" frame.

As to the communications issues, my sense is that WCEG could continue to fr=
ame its DINA communications plan around an "equitable growth" frame, irresp=
ective of who else funds individual DINA research components and irrespecti=
ve of what press releases INET or other research funders might issue.  But =
I'd be particularly interested, John, if you think I'm missing something or=
 if there's another strategy with INET that we might want to pursue?

Thanks.

Steve Daetz
