A New Era for Gay Rights?

NewYorker.com
By Richard Socarides


=E2=80=9CWhat does it feel like to have changed the world?=E2=80=9D As the =
Supreme Court
ruling on same-sex marriage approaches, many long-time gay-rights advocates
tell me that they are being asked this question. It speaks to more than
Obergefell v. Hodges, the case before the Court, or even gay marriage, but
to the dramatic increase in acceptance that L.G.B.T. people are
experiencing. Take, for example, Ireland=E2=80=99s vote for marriage equali=
ty and
Caitlyn Jenner=E2=80=99s warmly received coming out. Last month, a Gallup p=
oll
showed that sixty per cent of Americans agree that marriage between
same-sex couples should be recognized as valid. That number is the highest
it=E2=80=99s been in the nineteen years that Gallup has been asking the que=
stion.
