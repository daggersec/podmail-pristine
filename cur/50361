> CEA Chairs under the last seven Presidents -- including Ben Bernanke, Chri=
sty Romer, Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, Laura Tyson, and Martin Baily -- j=
ust released an open letter to the bipartisan leadership of the Senate and H=
ouse stating that TPA authority should be renewed and that trade agreements s=
hould not be used as vehicles to police currency manipulation.

> Dear Mr. Speaker, Mr. Leader, Madam Pelosi, and Senator Reid:

> International trade is fundamentally good for the U.S. economy, beneficial=
 to American families over time, and consonant with our domestic priorities.=
 That is why we support the renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to ma=
ke it possible for the United States to reach international agreements with o=
ur economic partners in Asia through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and=
 in Europe through the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)=
. Trade Promotion Authority provides for an up or down vote on these agreeme=
nts, without amendments, and thereby encourages our trade partners to put th=
eir best offers on the table.
> Expanded trade through these agreements will contribute to higher incomes a=
nd stronger productivity growth over time in both the United States and othe=
r countries.  U.S. businesses will enjoy improved access to overseas markets=
, while the greater variety of choices and lower prices trade brings will al=
low household budgets to go further to the benefit of American families.
> Trade is beneficial for our society as a whole, but the benefits are uneve=
nly distributed and some people are negatively affected by increased global c=
ompetition.  The economy-wide benefits resulting from increased trade provid=
e resources to make progress on important social goals, including helping th=
ose who are adversely affected.
> Increased global economic engagement will enhance U.S. global leadership i=
n line with our values. Indeed, trade agreements signed under both Democrati=
c and Republican Presidents have included provisions to combat corruption an=
d to strengthen environment and labor standards.
> It is not desirable for trade agreements to include provisions aimed at so=
-called currency manipulation. This is because monetary policy affects the v=
alue of currencies.  Attempts to penalize countries for supposedly manipulat=
ing exchange rates would thus impose constraints on U.S. monetary policy, to=
 the detriment of all Americans.
> We believe that agreements to foster greater international trade are in ou=
r national economic and security interests, and support a renewal of Trade P=
romotion Authority.

>> I think with ISDS and TPP there is a basic political question about how m=
uch HRC wants to break with the Administration. If she doesn't want to break=
 significantly with the Administration, I think she's stuck either using the=
 Admin's talking points on ISDS or answering the question with general answe=
r along the lines of "ISDS has in the past had clear benefits for American i=
nvestors overseas, as I said in my book, we are seeing more and more abuses o=
f ISDS and the Administration needs to make sure that the ISDS provisions in=
 TPP prevent abusive tactics from ever being used against the United States.=
" That then puts the onus back on the Admin to try to modify ISDS a bit from=
 the standard text, but also gives the Admin space to say "and yes, we are m=
aking sure ISDS in TPP addresses concerns about abuse." If HRC wanted to bre=
ak with the Admin and come out more skeptical of ISDS, I share Jen's view th=
at she should cushion the blow to to the business community by embracing mor=
e a more active posture in terms of the US government bringing cases (which I=
 am sure she will favor across the board on trade issues).=20
>>=20
>> On the policy merits of ISDS, I generally agree with Jen. Historically U.=
S. investors got benefits from ISDS because it gave them protections in high=
er-risk overseas markets, and, practically speaking, the US did not have a c=
oncern that foreign investors in the U.S. would use ISDS against us. However=
, I that that the risk profile is changing and that the US faces significant=
, rising risks of ISDS being used against us by foreign investors in the fut=
ure. I take Mike's point that most of the ISDS cases globally to date have b=
een brought by European investors under European trade agreements, but this-=
-like other successful litigation--strikes me as a trend that is likely to s=
pread as companies and law firms build expertise in bringing cases. So I do t=
hink there is merit to Warren's concerns, and that, at a policy level going f=
orward, the US needs to do a re-think on ISDS to come up with some new propo=
sals that narrow ISDS and better protect national regulatory authorities.=20=

 to be, that's our test -- but HRC is reserving judgment on whether TPP meet=

 best possible deal ... but we're going to wait and see.

e., as written it's intended not to take a view on maximalist Schumer bill v=
s. more modest Lew enhanced dialogue.  As drafted, point was to enunciate a p=

hink that it is going to be tough to come up with something on ISDS "outside=
 the agreement" to address concerns about ISDS; ISDS is very much an inside t=
he agreement issue. (Unlike currency, where there are obviously ways of addr=
essing it outside trade agreements). If someone else has a creative idea, th=
at would be great, but I don't see a lot of ways to mitigate concerns about I=
SDS other than addressing those concerns inside trade agreement language.&nb=
sp;</div><div><br clear=3D"none"></div><div>I think with ISDS and TPP there i=
s a basic political question about how much HRC wants to break with the Admi=
nistration. If she doesn't want to break significantly with the Administrati=
on, I think she's stuck either using the Admin's talking points on ISDS or a=
nswering the question with general answer along the lines of "ISDS has in th=
e past had clear benefits for American investors overseas, as I said in my b=
ook, we are seeing more and more abuses of ISDS and the Administration needs=
 to make sure that the ISDS provisions in TPP prevent abusive tactics from e=
ver being used against the United States." That then puts the onus back on t=
he Admin to try to modify ISDS a bit from the standard text, but also gives t=
he Admin space to say "and yes, we are making sure ISDS in TPP addresses con=
cerns about abuse." If HRC wanted to break with the Admin and come out more s=
keptical of ISDS, I share Jen's view that she should cushion the blow to to t=
he business community by embracing more a more active posture in terms of th=
e US government bringing cases (which I am sure she will favor across the bo=
ard on trade issues).&nbsp;</div><div><br clear=3D"none"></div><div>On the p=
olicy merits of ISDS, I generally agree with Jen. Historically U.S. investor=
s got benefits from ISDS because it gave them protections in higher-risk ove=
rseas markets, and, practically speaking, the US did not have a concern that=
 foreign investors in the U.S. would use ISDS against us. However, I that th=
at the risk profile is changing and that the US faces significant, rising ri=
sks of ISDS being used against us by foreign investors in the future. I take=
 Mike's point that most of the ISDS cases globally to date have been brought=
 by European investors under European trade agreements, but this--like other=
 successful litigation--strikes me as a trend that is likely to spread as co=
mpanies and law firms build expertise in bringing cases. So I do think there=
 is merit to Warren's concerns, and that, at a policy level going forward, t=
he US needs to do a re-think on ISDS to come up with some new proposals that=
 narrow ISDS and better protect national regulatory authorities.&nbsp;</div>=

 has outlived its original utility (rule of law has made impressive gains in=
 many places, especially Europe and Asia. Moreover, political risk insurance=
 is easily procured on the private marketplace). Second, ISDS crept well bey=
ond its original scope: it was originally intended for use in investor prote=

refully calibrated to emphasize that it does not mark a move to protectionis=
m or an abandonment of concern for U.S. business overseas. I am still lookin=

 minimum, changes should seek to should place more of the risks and costs of=
 litigation back onto the firms bringing these cases; and to consider differ=

&nbsp;While it is not a complete solution, one means of softening blowback f=
