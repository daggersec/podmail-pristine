Romney Pulls Ads in South Carolina, Florida

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has decided to pull his
advertising from South Carolina, where he was hoping to take on Mike
Huckabee and John McCain, and from Florida, where Rudy Giuliani has been
spending time and money.

"We feel the best strategy is to focus our paid messaging in Michigan,"
Romney spokesman Kevin Madden said Wednesday.

The decision comes on the heels of back-to-back second-place finishes in
Iowa and New Hampshire for the former Massachusetts governor. Romney, a
multimillionaire who had used some of his own cash, had invested heavily in
both states, counting on the two to give him the momentum toward the
nomination.

Earlier on Wednesday, Romney had assured his top financial backers that he
will win the upcoming Michigan primary, as he and his staff worked to soothe
supporters unsettled by his losses in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire
primary.

"It's just getting started," the presidential contender told hundreds of
supporters gathered at a convention center for a followup to the "National
Call Day" that raised an unprecedented $6.5 million a year ago

He promised to carry on to Michigan, which votes Jan. 15, as well as Nevada
and South Carolina, which vote Jan. 19.

The public spectacle, a rarity for the normally tightly controlled Romney
political operation, included appeals for calm from a top financial backer,
eBay CEO Meg Whitman, and a top political supporter, former Sen. Jim Talent
of Missouri.

"To a person, we remain incredibly optimistic that we still have a chance to
win this thing," Whitman told the crowd, which included everyone from
Fortune 500 executives to entrepreneurs.

Spencer Zwick, Romney's national finance director, told the phone bankers:
"If for some reason he is not the nominee, all those funds will be returned
to the donor himself."
