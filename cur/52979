Hey John,


Welcome back to the world outside the White House gates... Jane and I had a=
 good meeting with Christy and the CEQ team, and got over to meet Brian ear=
lier this week, so we're full steam ahead with the monuments process. Thank=
s for all your help on that front.


I know you don't have your comptroller this week with Eryn off on R&R, but =
I'm in the CAP office through the end of the day tomorrow, and would love t=
o grab a couple minutes with you if you can squeeze me in. In case that's n=
ot possible, I'm putting a couple quick things into this message for your f=
eedback:


1. Possible resilience event with Sullivan at CAP in March - I've been appr=
oached by Kathy Sullivan's office about CAP hosting a public discussion wit=
h her on resiliency--both NOAA's focus and CAP's products/recommendations. =
They're interested in a one-on-one "Oprah-style" conversation between Sulli=
van and a CAP rep. It would be great to have either you, Neera, or Carol. T=
he date they currently have on hold on her calendar is March 23 for an even=
t from 12-1:30 I'm checking with folks internally, but wanted to flag this =
to see if it's something you're interested in or available to do--role coul=
d either be hosting the conversation or delivering brief introductory remar=
ks.


2. IUU/Traceability policy - I understand the recommendations on traceabili=
ty may go final as soon as mid-March, and there's still some concern among =
the enviros that NOAA's not taking them seriously enough or being adequatel=
y flexible in playing nice with the other agencies. The concern is that wit=
hout your strong voice in the WH, these recs will float off into the ether =
without any continuing push for implementation or rulemakings. I'm not sure=
 there's a specific ask for you in this point, other than to just confirm t=
hat Brian and Christy understand that they're going to have to hold NOAA's =
feet to the fire on this point.


Any feedback welcome...


Best,

Mike
