<b>Dear John Podesta</b>: 

<p>We are pleased that you will be joining us for the 

43rd running of the Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run or 5K Run-Walk on Sunday, April 12, 2015. 


<p>This message contains important information including your bib number and registration information. However, we have two important announcements before we provide you with that information.

<p><b>1. You are strongly urged to download the .pdf file containing the complete Runner Confirmation and Instructions brochure. To do so, please</b> 


	<a href="http://www.cherryblossom.org/15files/2015_10M_Race_Instructions_(final).pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>. 


Most of the information contained in the Runner Confirmation and Instructions appears on the race website <a href="http://www.cherryblossom.org" target="_blank">www.cherryblossom.org</a> as well. 

<p><b>2. You are strongly urged to download our expanded Credit Union Cherry Blossom App available for both iOS and Android devices.</b> It can be downloaded from the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/credit-union-cherry-blossom/id977751894?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xacte.eventapp.cucb" target="_blank">Google Play</a> by searching for 'CUCB' or 'Credit Union Cherry Blossom.' If you forget to print out and bring the confirmation information in this message to packet pick-up at the National Building Museum, you can retrieve it from the App and avoid the number look-up lines.


	


<p>Now, on to your key registration information as it appears in our records.

<p><b style="font-size:10pt;">--- Please have the information above with you when picking up your number ---</b>


<p>If any of the information above is incorrect, please send an email with a correction to <a href="mailto:entry@cherryblossom.org" target="_blank">entry@cherryblossom.org</a>. IMPORTANT: Please put in the "Subject" line of your email message what information you are correcting (i.e. AGE CORRECTION or ADDRESS CORRECTION, etc.). This will greatly facilitate our processing. 


	<p><b>Health and Fitness Expo and Packet Pick-up:</b> Packet Pick-up will take place over two days at the National Building Museum (please note that there is no race day pick-up; no exceptions): Here is the information you will need to pick up your packet before the race.

	<p>Packet pick-up will take place on the second floor of the Health and Fitness Expo on Friday, April 10 between 3:00 P.M. and 7:45 P.M. (Note new Friday hours) and Saturday, April 11 between 9:00 A.M. and 4:45 P.M. (sharp!) at the spectacular National Building Museum, 401 F St., NW, Washington, DC <a href="http://www.nbm.org/about-us" target="_blank">www.nbm.org/about-us</a>. The National Building Museum is located directly opposite the Judiciary Square Metro stop on the Red Line. Metro use is strongly encouraged; parking is difficult to find and expensive! There is free bike valet parking on the west lawn (4th St. side) of the National Building Museum.

<p><b><i>There is no Sunday pick</i></b>-<b><i>up at the race site on the Washington Monument Grounds</i></b>. <b><i>No exceptions</i></b>. Details about having someone else pick-up your number on Friday or Saturday appear below. 

<p>We have two suggestions to minimize crowding at the National Building Museum. <i>First</i>, <i>avoid trying to pick up your packet the moment packet pick</i>-<i>up opens on either Friday or Saturday</i>. Last year, we had lines at the opening times which dissipated an hour later and never reformed. Second, we are asking you to pick up your packets based on the following schedule based on the first letter of your last name. We realize that your personal schedule may not allow this or you may be picking up with a group. However, if a decent percentage of entrants adhere to this schedule, it will ease the flow for everyone.

<p>You should bring this email with you to facilitate packet pick-up or download the free official Credit Union Cherry Blossom app for the iPhone, iPad or Android which will enable you to look you bib number up on your phone. If you do neither of these, you will need to go to the "Information Desk" in front of the fountain where volunteers will assist you in looking up your number. We will not have "Number Look-up" sheets posted on the wall.


<p>You may pick up another runner's packet as long as you have a note (an email is fine) from that runner or his or her copy of this confirmation email, plus an ID for yourself. You may need to sign a waiver stating that the number only will be used by the proper registrant and supply us with your email address. Violations of this policy will result in the registrant being banned from future races at the discretion of the organizing committee.

<p><b>Here is some other news from the event:</b> 

<p><b>Key Race Information Leading up to the Race and on Race Day</b>

<p><b>Clinics and a Line Up of Social Activities at the Health and Fitness Expo:</b> There will be music, and beer (for those of sufficient age - one free beer for runners; $5 for others), and other non-alcoholic beverages (the popular Cherry Blossom Mocktail will return), courtesy of the 201 Bar, along with snacks from Cabot cheese on Friday evening between 5:00 P.M. and 7:30 P.M. (or as long as supplies last), so come and unwind after work on Friday. In addition, we have an exciting array of speakers lined up for our clinics on both Friday and Saturday.

<p><b>Charity Fundraiser Updates</b>: There is still time for confirmed race entrants to become <b><i>Individual Online Fundraisers</i></b>. You can go to the Children's Miracle Network Fundraising site <a href="http://www.helpmakemiracles.org/event/cucherryblossom/"target="_blank">www.helpmakemiracles.org/event/cucherryblossom</a> and register as an "Individual Fundraiser." You will be able to set up your own fundraising webpage which you can forward to family members and friends to invite them to support both you and Children's Miracle Network in either the 10 mile run or the 5K Run-Walk.

<p><i>Consider the following:</i> Every day is filled with decisions.  Few are between life and death.  As a fundraiser in support of Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and the Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run you have an opportunity to say "yes" to life for thousands of sick and injured children.

<p>Asking your friends and family to support you in the run can be a struggle. But as you ask, remember all the children who struggle with challenges far beyond anything we can imagine. There are children who are told "no" every day -- "No, your blood counts are still too low." "No, you're too sick to go outside and play today."

<p> On behalf of the kids:
<li> Log into your fundraising page now
<li> And please "Ask"

<p>For more information or questions, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@cmnhospitals.org" target="_blank">support@cmnhospitals.org</a>. 

<p>Thanks for saying "yes" to the kids!

<p><b>Credit Union Donation Drive for Hospitals at Expo:</b> Credit unions are conducting a donation drive for Children's National Medical Center and Johns Hopkins Children's Center during the Race Health and Fitness Expo.  Runners, please bring a game or book (new and unwrapped) for teens, ages 12 - 18. Examples can be hand-held games, Sudoku, Uno cards, etc. Look for donation bins near the fountain in the National Building Museum on April 10 and 11. Since becoming the title sponsors of the race in 2002, credit unions, business partners, and runners, have donated over $6.5 million to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

<p><b>Watch Your Email Inbox for Our Virtual Goodie Bag</b>! We will be emailing everyone our "Virtual Goodie Bag" around April 4. This environmentally-friendly electronic "goodie bag" replaces the usual clutter which lies in the bottom of the old fashioned goodie bag with dozens of clickable electronic coupons, information and offers for our sponsors and other vendors. However, we will still be distributing clear plastic bags at packet pick-up which must be used for bag check on race day. 

<p><b>Sustainability News:</b> We're taking it up a notch in 2015, attempting to achieve gold certification from the Council for Responsible Sport for our efforts to conduct a sustainable event. A key area of focus will be waste diversion, which means we want to prevent as much of the 8 to 10 tons of waste generated as possible from being sent to a landfill. Our goal in 2015 is to recycle, compost and donate at least 75% of the waste generated, an 8% increase from 2014. With your help, we can do it! Almost everything you receive on race morning, including heat sheets, can be recycled or composted. We'll make it easy to do so. Even clothing discarded at the start line will be collected and donated. You will hear more about sustainability, and how you can help, over the coming months and at the expo. For more information about our efforts, visit: <a href="http://www.cherryblossom.org/aboutus/environment.php" target="_blank">www.cherryblossom.org/aboutus/environment.php</a>

<p><b>Use Metro to Travel to the Race Site:</b> Metro will open at 5:00 A.M. on race day. The staging area is 1/4 mile from the Smithsonian Metro stop. 

<p><b>Getting to the Race by Bicycle:</b> As part of our sustainability initiative we have upgraded our free Bike Valet parking this year. Simply ride your bike to the race site and leave it with us. We will guard your bike to ensure it is safe while you run. No backpacks may be left with your bike.


<p><b>Important Information about Time Limits in the 10 Mile:</b> In order to balance the interests of tourists in town for cherry blossom season and the participants in the race, we need to close the 10-mile course promptly at 10:30 A.M.. Runners who are not maintaining a 14-minute per mile pace or faster will have to leave the course at the 5-mile mark (located about 1/4 mile from the start-finish line). Runners who fall behind the 14-minute per mile pace during the second half of the race will need to board our sweep bus and be driven to the finish line. 

<p> <b>Don't Want the Pressure? Switch to the 5K Run-Walk (Don't worry, your 10 mile number will work in the 5K Run-Walk):</b> If you don't think you will be maintaining a 14-minute per mile pace, you can run or walk the  5K Run-Walk instead. We would prefer to have you go to the website, <a href="http://www.cherryblossom.org" target="_blank">www.cherryblossom.org</a> and complete a "5K Run-Walk Switch" form so we will know what race you are in. However, if you decide to switch on race day, you can simply line up at the 5K Run-Walk start. <b>Please be aware that you will be running the 5K Run-Walk with your 10-mile bib number and that is OK.</b>  We will not reissue you a 5K bib number. Your "B-Tag" will be "read" by the ChronoTrack system and you will be scored in whichever race you actually run. 


<p><i>Go gently on your training these last two weeks.</i> I know if you are a participant in our Virtual Training program that Coach Kirt West is rounding you into shape to meet your race goal. Although your training is nearly over, you can still prepare for your hydration needs by using Gatorade Endurance Formula between now and race day. It is what will be served at the aid stations on the course.

<p>We send our best wishes for personal best times for everyone. It looks like the blossoms will be out!

<p>Sincerely, 
<br>The Credit Union Cherry Blossom Organizing Committee 

<p>P.S. Remember, to speed up the packet pick-up process, bring this confirmation letter with you to the National Building Museum (or have the App on your phone) on Friday or Saturday and remember that there is no packet pick-up on the Washington Monument Grounds on Sunday.
