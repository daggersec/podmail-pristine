Dear Georgetown Law Community,

If you know someone who is looking to live in the heart of Clarendon,  plea=
se share this with them.   A dear friend of mine is moving out and looking =
for someone ASAP!

Below is the message from my friend and the link for pictures!  If you have=
 any questions, let me know.

Thank you in advance!

JL


Available Nov 1, but flexible for earlier/later move-in.

The apartment has 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, spacious living area with hardwo=
od floors, fully equipped kitchen, W/D in unit. The living area is fully fu=
rnished, but your bedroom is not. The bedroom has two large closets. There =
is a gym, a pool, bike room, and parking garage ($100/month) in the buildin=
g.

Location
If you are looking to live in Clarendon, the location could not be better. =
The building is less than a minute walk from the Clarendon metro station, 2=
 bus lines, Trader Joe's, CVS, and numerous restaurants/bars.

Roommates
Two twenty-something female professionals, who are uniquely tidy and respec=
tful. Female roommates preferred.

You would be taking over the lease until July (although it is possible to t=
ransfer the lease to another person before that date). It is also possible =
to resign the lease after July. The building will need to see proof of empl=
oyment. There is a $50 application fee and $100 amenity fee. You'll pay a s=
hare of the utilities, which averages around $100/month/person throughout t=
he year.

Please email if interested. Tell us bit about yourself and we can arrange t=
o show you the place. Thanks!
