Donate to LCV Victory Fund: Eight battleground Senate races are up for grab=

The FEC Deadline is this Sunday, September 30th. Eight critical Senate seat=
s are up for grabs - New Mexico, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Arizona, Monta=
na, Nevada, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Chip in with a donation=A0today to hel=
p LCV Victory Fund win: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DfHENxYDsxg96Ggq0MC=
XJjg .

Our eight priority Senate races are still up for grabs - less than six week=
s from Election Day.

In addition to LCV-backed Senate candidates in Montana, Massachusetts, Ariz=
ona and Virginia, there are also four current House members - all of whom a=
re environmental champions=A0 - running for Senate: Rep. Chris Murphy of Co=
nnecticut, Rep. Shelley Berkley of Nevada, Rep. Martin Heinrich of New Mexi=
co, and Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.

All of them are running even with their opponents or are just beginning to =
pull ahead. We can win all these races, but everything will come down to vo=
ter turnout.

So far, more than 1,538 supporters have donated to help expand LCV Victory =
Fund's field efforts and put these environmental champions ahead. If you ma=
de a gift, thank you! We're grateful that you've been able to help. LCV Vic=
tory Fund urgently needs to reach our goal of $120,000 for canvassing and g=
et-out-the-vote efforts by this Sunday, September 30th - the FEC deadline.=
=A0On Monday, October 1st, our campaign field team is expected to assess re=
sources and prioritize races for the final weeks of this election. I don't =
want to leave any winnable Senate races out, so please make a gift today.

Donate to LCV Victory Fund - environmental champions from coast to coast ar=
e in close, tough races. Your donation could mean the difference between vi=
ctory and defeat on November 6th. Will you chip in today?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Dmz3R2UyPessOYqeesrsALg

The four House members running for Senate all have stellar lifetime scores =
on LCV's National Environmental Scorecard. Rep. Baldwin has a 97 percent sc=
ore, Rep. Berkley's score is 87 percent, Rep. Murphy's score is 98 percent,=
 and Rep. Heinrich has a 95 percent score.

These four are great examples of the types of leaders we want to help move =
from the House to the Senate - but all four are running in TOUGH races. If =
we want to protect decades of sound environmental protections - and advance=
 new environmental policies -=A0 we must help them win on November 6th.

We really need your support right away. These environmental champions are k=
icking their campaigns into high gear, so now is the moment to launch LCV's=
 game-changing tactics. Big Oil and other polluting interests have disastro=
us plans for our planet's future, and it's time to buckle down and defeat t=
hem - and their candidates -- at the ballot box.

Let's put these four environmental champions in the Senate. We can do this.=
 Will you chip in with a donation today?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D7t42NQS03TAyMCLQICV4zA

While these four races are a priority for us, we are also organizing and mo=
bilizing in key Senate battleground races like Montana, Massachusetts, Virg=
inia, and Arizona - races that also feature a sharp contrast between candid=
ates who support Big Oil's agenda and candidates who support clean energy p=
olicies. Your donation will help us ensure that we've got the resources to =
go door-to-door, make phone calls, send hard-hitting mail and run aggressiv=
e media campaigns in all of our targeted Senate races.

Now is the time to make your gift. If you've been sitting on the sidelines,=
 now is the time to get in the game. We need your support! The next few wee=
ks are absolutely critical and the September 30th FEC deadline is just days=
 away.=A0Please donate today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DAXwQmZqai2eR=

Thank you for your support.
