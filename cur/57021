 the East Fork of the Salmon River, generational ranching families provide =
significant benefits in maintaining the historic character and nature of Ea=
st Fork while providing significant conservation benefits to the land, incl=

 spaces and un-fragmented landscapes of the East Fork valley. In order to p=
rovide another tool for these families to maintain their livelihoods, a pro=
vision has been included to provide permittees within and adjacent to the p=

 way to help them remain viable with as little disruption as possible.=C2=
