Neocons Slither Back Into Public Debate

Washington, D.C. - In the last nine months, the American homeland has not b=
een attacked, the most significant plot against the U.S. since 9-11 has bee=
n stopped, key terrorist operatives have been killed overseas, terror opera=
tions have been disrupted in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen, and =
global support for the U.S. has skyrocketed.  Yet prominent neoconservative=
s Liz Cheney, daughter of the former Vice President, and Bill Kristol have =
launched a new foreign policy group dedicated not to preventing attacks aga=
inst American but rather one devoted to attacking President Obama. Subtly t=
itled "Keep America Safe (KAS)", the initiative is more about defending the=
 Bush administration's legacy and its failed policies than advancing approa=
ches that would enhance American security.

What role can Americans play in keeping their country secure?  Two of KAS's=
 recommended "five ways to keep America safe" are "write news editors" and =
"call talk radio." Cheney and Kristol's records -- Cheney's short and unsuc=
cessful tenure at the State Department and Bill Kristol's support for invad=
ing Iraq and his outlandish claims before and after the war -- should place=
 these two firmly on the fringes of American politics. KAS' advice is spect=
acularly reminiscent of President Bush's admonition to Americans to "go sho=
pping" after 9-11. The policies that KAS advocates are simply a retreading =
of the same neoconservative foreign policies that failed so dramatically un=
der the Bush administration.

While neocons continue to breathlessly advocate and attempt to advance thei=
r past failures as solutions to the threats we currently face, the American=
 people have wisely turned the page.

Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol form new group to attack Obama and promote radi=
cal neoconservative policies. Politico reports, "Former Vice President Dick=
 Cheney's eldest daughter Liz will launch a new group aimed at rallying opp=
osition to the "radical" foreign policy of the Obama administration which i=
t says has succeeded only in undermining the nation's security.  The new gr=
oup, Keep America Safe, will make the case against President Barack Obama's=
 moves to wrench America away from Bush era foreign policy on issues from d=
etaining alleged terrorists at Guantanamo Bay to building a missile shield =
in Eastern Europe."

The group does not enjoy universal conservative support:  Freddy Gray of th=
e American Conservative has even repudiated KAS: "Liz Cheney's 'Keep Americ=
a Safe' group, a new-fangled PR initiative against executive branch 'weakne=
ss' on foreign policy, is obviously preposterous. But then what should one =
expect from the Angler's spawn?... for readers of realist persuasion, the O=
bama policies she [Deborah Burlingame, KAS board member] objects to are sur=
ely the most (only?) attractive aspects of his presidency. With America sti=
ll ruining herself abroad thanks to the Bush Doctrine, the idea that it is =
of tantamount importance for Obama to preserve precisely the same foreign p=
olicy as his predecessor is laughable."

Politico highlights how the organization is structured to launch attacks, n=
ot promote policy choices: "The group's mechanics are largely a product of =
former campaign aides to Senator John McCain: Michael Goldfarb, now a Weekl=
y Standard blogger, is an adviser to the group; its executive director is M=
cCain war room chief Aaron Harison, and the video was produced by Justin Ge=
rmany, the McCain aide who produced a campaign video titled, 'The One,' whi=
ch mocked Obama as a messianic figure." [Politico, 10/13/09<http://rs6.net/=

F13%2Fkeep-america-feared%2F&id=3Dpreview>]

Keep America Safe's message undercut by board members Liz Cheney's and Bill=
 Kristol's incompetence.  In a May debate at Rockefeller University on stra=
tegies for dealing with Iran, Cheney argued that the "threat of military fo=
rce" was the only way to convince Iran to "get serious about sanctions."  F=
ormer Undersecretary of State Nick Burns responded by blasting Cheney and h=
er father, accusing them of living "in an alternate universe."  According t=
o the Washington Post's Al Kamen, a pre-debate poll of 430 audience members=
 showed that 34 percent favored Cheney's position, with 33 percent supporti=
ng Burns and another 33 percent undecided.  But, "[a]fter the one-hour, 45-=
minute debate, Cheney's position was favored by 35 percent, while the Burns=
 team rocketed to a whopping 59 percent vote and undecideds dropped to 6 pe=
rcent." Marina Ottaway, senior associate and co-director of the Democracy a=
nd Rule of Law Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, t=
old the American Prospect "She came in knowing very little about the Middle=
 East. She had a mandate to do democracy promotion, but she had very little=
 familiarity with the subject. ... They deliberately picked a person who wa=
s not a Middle East specialist, so that the conventional wisdom, well, let =
me rephrase, so that real, actual knowledge of the issues in the region wou=
ldn't interfere with policy."

Bill Kristol too suffers from a well-documented credibility deficit.  Even =
while the mission in Afghanistan continued, Kristol argued that a war in Ir=
aq "could have terrifically good effects throughout the Middle East."  Wors=
e, on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Kristol declared: "Very few war=
s in American history were prepared better or more thoroughly than this one=
 by this president." [Politico, 5/12/09<http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=3D4pw46adab=

Keep America Safe seeks to promote the Bush-era policies that failed to kee=
p us safe. CNN reports that "The group plans to tackle hot-button issues li=
ke the way forward in Iraq and Afghanistan, defense spending, CIA interroga=
tion techniques, and the planned closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention fa=
cility..." These are the precisely issues that were the Bush administration=
's greatest failures.  As Steve Benen of the Washington Monthly writes, "Li=
z Cheney added that the group would defend and promote Bush-era policies: '=
There's no turning away from that legacy at all.' That's not unexpected -- =
self-reflection is not one of the neocons' strengths -- but it does offer a=
n opportunity to remind the Cheney/Kristol crowd that we tried it their way=
, and it was a spectacular failure. 'Keep America Safe' looks back at the B=
ush era and sees a national security record to be proud of. Except for the =
catastrophic events of 9/11, and the anthrax attacks against Americans, and=
 terrorist attacks against U.S. allies, and the terrorist attacks against U=
.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Bush's inability to capture those r=
esponsible for 9/11, and waging an unnecessary war that inspired more terro=
rists, and the success terrorists had in exploiting Bush's international un=
popularity, they may have a point. The truth is, Cheney/Kristol had their d=
ay. They got to do exactly what they wanted to do -- torture, preemptive wa=
r, abandoning the rule of law, abandoning democratic norms, alienating alli=
es, ignoring the concept of international cooperation -- and they failed an=
yway."

Michael Cohen writes in Politico today, "the tables are turning. Democrats =
have narrowed the Republican advantage on national security. They are seen =
as more effective when it comes to improving global respect for America and=
 working closely with the country's allies. And in a poll result that would=
 have raised eyebrows only a few years ago, President Barack Obama is more =
trusted on foreign policy than he is on the economy and health care. Today,=
 more than seven in 10 Americans consider him a strong leader." [CNN, 10/13=

<p><b>Washington, D.C.</b> - In the last nine months, the American homeland=
 has
not been attacked, the most significant plot against the U.S. since 9-11 ha=
s
been stopped, key terrorist operatives have been killed overseas, terror
operations have been disrupted in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen,=
 and
global support for the U.S. has skyrocketed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet prominent
neoconservatives Liz Cheney, daughter of the former Vice President, and Bil=
l
Kristol have launched a new foreign policy group dedicated not to preventin=
g
attacks against American but rather one devoted to attacking President Obam=
a.
Subtly titled &quot;Keep America Safe (KAS)&quot;, the initiative is more a=
bout
defending the Bush administration's legacy and its failed policies than
advancing approaches that would enhance American security. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>What role can Americans play in keeping their country secure?&nbsp; Two =
of
KAS's recommended &quot;five ways to keep America safe&quot; are &quot;writ=
e
news editors&quot; and &quot;call talk radio.&quot; Cheney and Kristol's
records -- Cheney's short and unsuccessful tenure at the State Department a=
nd
Bill Kristol's support for invading Iraq and his outlandish claims before a=
nd
after the war -- should place these two firmly on the fringes of American
politics. KAS' advice is spectacularly reminiscent of President Bush's
admonition to Americans to &quot;go shopping&quot; after 9-11.&nbsp;The
policies that KAS advocates are simply a retreading of the same neoconserva=
tive
foreign policies that failed so dramatically under the Bush administration.=
 <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>While neocons continue to breathlessly advocate and attempt to advance t=
heir
past failures as solutions to the threats we currently face, the American
people have wisely turned the page.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>Liz Cheney and Bill Kristol form new group to attack Obama and promot=
e
radical neoconservative policies.</b> Politico reports, &quot;<span

repudiated KAS: &quot;Liz Cheney's 'Keep America Safe' group, a new-fangled=
 PR
initiative against executive branch 'weakness' on foreign policy, is obviou=
sly
preposterous. But then what should one expect from the Angler's spawn?... f=
or
readers of realist persuasion, the Obama policies she [Deborah Burlingame, =
KAS
board member] objects to are surely the most (only?) attractive aspects of =
his
presidency. With America still ruining herself abroad thanks to the Bush
Doctrine, the idea that it is of tantamount importance for Obama to preserv=

precisely the same foreign policy as his predecessor is laughable.&quot;<o:=

<p><b>Keep America Safe's message undercut by board members Liz Cheney's an=
d
Bill Kristol's incompetence.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;In a May debate at Rockefeller
University on strategies for dealing with Iran, Cheney argued that the
&quot;threat of military force&quot; was the only way to convince Iran to
&quot;get serious about sanctions.&quot;&nbsp; Former Undersecretary of Sta=
te
Nick Burns responded by blasting Cheney and her father, accusing them of li=
ving
&quot;in an alternate universe.&quot;&nbsp; According to the Washington Pos=
t's
Al Kamen,&nbsp;a pre-debate poll of 430 audience members showed that 34 per=
cent
favored Cheney's position, with 33 percent supporting Burns and another 33
percent undecided.&nbsp; But, &quot;[a]fter the one-hour, 45-minute debate,
Cheney's position was favored by 35 percent, while the Burns team rocketed =
to a
whopping 59 percent vote and undecideds dropped to 6 percent.&quot; Marina
Ottaway, senior associate and co-director of the Democracy and Rule of Law
Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told the America=
n
Prospect &quot;She came in knowing very little about the Middle East. She h=
ad a
mandate to do democracy promotion, but she had very little familiarity with=
 the
subject. ... They deliberately picked a person who was not a Middle East
specialist, so that the conventional wisdom, well, let me rephrase, so that
real, actual knowledge of the issues in the region wouldn't interfere with
policy.&quot;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Bill Kristol too suffers from a well-documented credibility deficit.&nbs=
p;
Even while the mission in Afghanistan continued, Kristol argued that a war =
in
Iraq &quot;could have terrifically good effects throughout the Middle
East.&quot;&nbsp; Worse, on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Kristol
declared: &quot;Very few wars in American history were prepared better or m=
ore
thoroughly than this one by this president.&quot; <span style=3D'color:blac=

strengths -- but it does offer an opportunity to remind the Cheney/Kristol
crowd that we tried it their way, and it was a spectacular failure. 'Keep
America Safe' looks back at the Bush era and sees a national security recor=

attacks against Americans, and terrorist attacks against U.S. allies, and t=

terrorist attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Bush's
inability to capture those responsible for 9/11, and waging an unnecessary =

Bush's international unpopularity, they may have a point. The truth is,
Cheney/Kristol had their day. They got to do exactly what they wanted to do=

torture, preemptive war, abandoning the rule of law, abandoning democratic
