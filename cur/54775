Joel,=20
I generally agree with the point, but we need a strategy on this that goes b=
eyond internal discipline. This story could have been written without any of=
 these big mouths blabbing. The mere involvement of Wendy gave them license t=
o write this. The only thing in the story that indicated that someone on the=
 inside was talking was the reference to the H, although one of Peter Sealey=
's big clients is Coke so we probably know where that came from. We can and s=
hould try to shut this down, but it is going to be tough until we get to a p=
oint where someone can actually talk on behalf of the campaign. One particul=
ar challenge is Spence. He's worked with them for 40 years. He's like Harold=
 Ickes-Reporters will think he's inside even if he's not. We need a strategy=
 to enable people who are real and disable those that aren't.=20
