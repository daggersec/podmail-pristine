Dear CAP family,

It's happy trails time, folks. I'm not going to repeat what I said in my De=
cember note following the announcement that I was headed to the White House=
. But I do want to reprise how terribly proud I am of CAP as an institution=
 and all of you as individuals.

Working in the White House has its moments, including getting to ride on a =
painted elephant<https://www.google.com/url?sa=3Dt&rct=3Dj&q=3D&esrc=3Ds&so=
urce=3Dweb&cd=3D1&cad=3Drja&ved=3D0CCsQFjAA&url=3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnews.google.=
com%2Fnewspapers%3Fnid%3D1356%26dat%3D20000324%26id%3DI28xAAAAIBAJ%26sjid%3=
DmAgEAAAAIBAJ%26pg%3D4963%2C4848095&ei=3DRtnGUpWUMuKpsASGxoGoDQ&usg=3DAFQjC=
NFmj2rqRRohgiE2Klzs_73n0gTf9A&sig2=3D83Anr2_rhXzi9UOL_QH-yA&bvm=3Dbv.581871=
78,d.cWc> for the first time, but building the Center for American Progress=
 has been the most rewarding professional experience of my life. I am profo=
undly grateful to our Board members, who gave me this opportunity, as well =
as to our supporters, our allies, and, most importantly, our staff and our =
interns who have built this mighty franchise.

So many people deserve to be recognized who had a profound impact on CAP's =
success, but I can't leave without mentioning a few founding fathers and mo=
stly mothers who have gone on to greater glory-Sarah Wartell, Melody Barnes=
, Laura Nichols, Gayle Smith, Anna Soellner, Jennifer Palmieri, Tara McGuin=
ness, Faiz Shakir, David Halperin and David Dreyer. I also, with sadness, w=
ant to remember two founding Board members, the late Marion Sandler and Pet=
er Lewis, who went from being supporters to true friends and mentors. I lea=
rned so much from each of them.

I look back on the 10+ years that we have been in the arena, and I know tha=
t we have made life better for millions of people in America and around the=
 world. Along the way, we have built a spirit and culture that is passionat=
e, dedicated, intelligent, and above all else: really, really fun.

The list of things I'll miss is far too long, but rest assured it includes =
Neera dominating the dance floor at every holiday party; Marlene's fish sto=
ries; Daniella's star turn shilling for DirecTV; the kooky labeling of Larr=
y's holiday beer gift; Debbie's annoyance at my calling her Nurse Ratched e=
very time she thinks I'm about to jeopardize our tax status; Erin's amazing=
 intern brown bags; running with the Progressive Ninjas (no, wait, I'll sti=
ll be running with the Progressive Ninjas); Judd's droll reporting on the s=
pike in social media every time I say something about UFOs; Josh and Lori's=
 (usually inadvertent) efforts to keep me up to date on all things Miley Cy=
rus; Sarah Miller's ALL-CAPS, bolded to-do lists reminding us how much we h=
ad to do to get WCEG off the ground; Afghanistan adventure vacations with T=
om and Caroline; Melanie Hart dressing down Chinese officials in better Man=
darin than theirs; John Norris's propensity for puns; Matt Browne's unparal=
leled ability to turn any topic into a European vacation; and being able to=
 tweet Arrested Development jokes<https://twitter.com/johnpodesta/status/35=
0252513066352641> - or tweet at all, really.

I may not be able to publicly gloat when the Leftfielders thrash Heritage n=
ext season, but I trust Winnie and Anne Shoup to lead the team to victory.

I leave behind an executive leadership team that's the best it's ever been,=
 and Neera Tanden, whose unbelievable talents as President will take CAP so=
aring to new heights.

I want to close by thanking the people who have kept me sane even as I have=
 driven them crazy over the last couple of years-Kristina, Eryn, and Milia.

Change the world,

John

P.S. If, during 2014, you walk past Eryn and me on 17th St., leaning up aga=
inst a building with a cigar box and a "We'll work for food" sign, it's a g=
ood indication that the implementation of some major Obama initiative has g=
one horribly wrong-so please, take pity and make your Snapchats kind.
