Cheryl,
For what it's worth, in David Hoffmans  book on the CIA there is some
remarkable insight into how Stansfield Turner, while Director of the CIA
took home top secret classified reports that he edited and worked on. I
have copied the excerpt below which demonstrates deep and early precedent.
After reading yesterday's Wall Street journal editorial suggesting that
there is a criminal relationship to the email issue I thought this example
might be useful. It's time that you begin putting together a few highly
respected intelligence service professionals that will push out a few
talking points that will help level the playing field. Maybe Tom Donillon
might have some ideas.

Very best
Scott

=E2=80=9CAs CIA director, Turner took home draft National Intelligence Esti=
mates on
weekends and marked them up with red pencil. The estimates are the highest
product of =E2=80=9Cfinished=E2=80=9D intelligence that the CIA provides to=
 decision makers
in government, reflecting the results of espionage as well as analysis, and
they are usually created and polished by dozens of officials before being
disseminated. It was unheard of for a director to take them home and
personally edit them. Separately, Turner displayed an independent streak in
his thinking about the world and a fondness for analysis of it. He strongly
questioned the U.S. military=E2=80=99s gloomy estimates of the expanding So=
viet
military threat. This deeply irritated the Pentagon, but Turner insisted
that aspects of American strength were far superior and should be taken
into account. He wanted a genuine balance sheet, not just a catalog of the
latest Soviet threats=E2=80=9D
