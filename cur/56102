*From the Los Angeles Times*
Chamber of Commerce vows to punish anti-business candidates The group
indicates it will spend in excess of the approximately $60 million it put
out in the last presidential cycle.
By Tom Hamburger
Los Angeles Times Staff Writer

January 8, 2008

WASHINGTON =97 Alarmed at the increasingly populist tone of the 2008 politi=
cal
campaign, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is set to issue a
fiery promise to spend millions of dollars to defeat candidates deemed to b=
e
anti-business.

"We plan to build a grass-roots business organization so strong that when i=
t
bites you in the butt, you bleed," chamber President Tom Donohue said.

The warning from the nation's largest trade association came against a
background of mounting popular concern over the condition of the economy. A
weak record of job creation, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, declining home
values and other problems have all helped make the economy a major campaign
issue.

Presidential candidates in particular have responded to the public concern.
Former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina has been the bluntest populist
voice, but other front-running Democrats, including Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton of New York and Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, have also called for
change on behalf of middle-class voters.

On the Republican side, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee -- emerging as a=
n
unexpected front-runner after winning the Iowa caucuses -- has used populis=
t
themes in his effort to woo independent voters, blasting bonus pay for
corporate chief executives and the effect of unfettered globalization on
workers.

Reacting to what it sees as a potentially hostile political climate, Donohu=
e
said, the chamber will seek to punish candidates who target business
interests with their rhetoric or policy proposals, including congressional
and state-level candidates.

Although Donohue shied away from precise figures, h*e indicated that his
organization would spend in excess of the approximately $60 million it spen=
t
in the last presidential cycle.* That approaches the spending levels planne=
d
by the largest labor unions.

The chamber president is scheduled to announce the broad outlines of the
organization's plans for the 2008 election and beyond at a news conference
here today. Donohue also plans to fire a rhetorical warning shot across the
bow of candidates considered unfriendly to business.

"I'm concerned about anti-corporate and populist rhetoric from candidates
for the presidency, members of Congress and the media," he said. "It
suggests to us that we have to demonstrate who it is in this society that
creates jobs, wealth and benefits -- and who it is that eats them."

In advance of today's news conference, Donohue told The Times of his plans
to be active in 140 congressional districts this year, as well as the
presidential contest.

At the state level, Donohue said his organization would be active in nearly
four dozen contests for attorney general and state supreme courts. Both
state courts and attorneys general are involved in decisions affecting
business, including consumer protection and a wide range of litigation.

The chamber has become a significant force in state and national politics
under Donohue's decade of leadership. Once a notably bipartisan trade
association with a limited budget and limited influence, it has hugely
increased its political fundraising and developed new ways to spend money o=
n
behalf of pro-business candidates.

Under Donohue, the organization has also frequently aligned itself with GOP
priorities.

Since he took over the chamber, contributions by businesses have soared,
often to pay for political advertising known as "issue ads," which are
exempt from many of the Federal Election Commission limits.

Under a system Donohue pioneered, corporations contribute money to the
chamber, which then finances attack ads targeting individual candidates
without revealing the name of the businesses involved in the ads.

In 2000, drug companies paid the chamber to run advertisements in Michigan
to help elect then-Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham. Pharmaceutical companie=
s
that year gave the chamber additional millions to run issue ads attacking
mostly Democratic House candidates. And large corporations paid $1 million
or more to support advertising campaigns against judges deemed too friendly
to plaintiffs.

There has been pressure from lawsuits and government activist groups to
require the chamber to reveal the source of its political funds and more
details on its spending.

Donohue is not inclined to do so.

"I will disclose any funds I am legally required to disclose -- and not
disclose any others," Donohue said. "We are exercising our constitutional
right to petition the government and we will continue to do so."

In 2004, the chamber also helped defeat Senate Democratic Leader Tom
Daschle, flooding his home state of South Dakota with money, ads and more
than 50 on-the-ground organizers.

This year that kind of ground tactic is going to be more prevalent, Donohue
said, noting that the chamber plans to make use of its ability to
communicate freely with its 3 million member companies located in every
congressional district.

In the interview Monday, Donohue said he was unhappy with anti-corporate
rhetoric coming from candidates in both parties and he wanted candidates to
know about the chamber's ambitious plans.

Donohue is not likely to name names at his news conference, but there is no
doubt he is unhappy about Huckabee.

The concerns Donohue expresses reveal apprehension that Republican
pro-business candidates may lose favor with voters and that the GOP's
important but fragile alliance between economic and social conservatives is
showing signs of strain.

Even more than Republicans, Democratic candidates have boosted the volume o=
f
populist messages as the economy softens. Edwards, whose trial lawyer past
has been openly criticized by Donohue for years, launched new advertisement=
s
that warn against the danger of replacing "corporate Republicans with
corporate Democrats."

The middle class, Edwards says in the new ad, is "losing ground while CEOs
pocket million-dollar bonuses and corporate lobbyists get their way in
Washington."

Donohue, in effect the nation's leading business advocate, kicked back hard
at some of the leading Democratic proposals on taxes, labor law and the
courts.

If that agenda succeeds, he said, Democrats "will be gone from power for at
least 40 years," though he acknowledged that the political rhetoric might
moderate after the primary season.

"People on the other side have been very strong in the way they play in
legislation and elections. We intend to do the same," he said.
