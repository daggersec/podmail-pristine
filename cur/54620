With the elections coming up fast, it's time to turn our
collective focus to one thing: Helping leaders who support the
troops, while at the same time working to prevent the election
of those who don't. And it won't be easy.

Right now, at VoteVets.org, we're supporting 14 candidates for
Congress, along with one for the U.S. Senate - all of whom are
facing stiff resistance from both their opponents and from
outside political groups who oppose our commitment to shifting
our national security efforts from Iraq to Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Therefore, to ensure that we get the right people
elected, we're putting a three-pronged plan into action. We've
developed a field plan that will eventually include teams of
Iraq and Afghanistan veteran volunteers in all 50 states. We're
going to air those hard-hitting television ads you've come to
know. And we're in the process of penetrating the new media
market by spreading our message through our blog, VetVoice.com. 

To accomplish our goals, however, we need your help. We need to
raise $50,000 this week in order to slingshot our plan into the
next phase of this election season. Therefore, we'd like to
offer you signed copies of the critically-acclaimed war memoirs
written by our own members: The War I Always Wanted by Brandon
Friedman and Love My Rifle More Than You by Kayla Williams. In
return for your donation of $50, we'll send you the signed book
of your choice. Or if you give $85, we'll send you both.

These are two books that eloquently convey the complexities
present in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. They're the types
of books that would change American perceptions of the wars if
only enough people would read them. But don't take our word for
it. Check out what others have said:

General (Ret.) Wesley K. Clark on The War I Always Wanted:

"Compelling and moving. . .Among the many excellent war memoirs
by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, Brandon's stands out as the
best. I couldn't put it down."

Booklist on Love My Rifle More Than You:

"Whip smart, sassy, with a mouth as foul as a sailor's,
28-year-old Sergeant Kayla Williams. . .tells what it's like to
be a female soldier in Iraq."

Baltimore Sun on The War I Always Wanted:

"You'll want to read parts. . .aloud to somebody. Friedman tells
stories well, with a keen eye for war's absurdities and his own
fading illusions of war's glory."

Publishers Weekly on Love My Rifle More Than You:

"The account succeeds and even echoes military memoirists from
Julius Caesar to Ernie Pyle. The fear, bad weather, intermittent
supplies, inedible meals (especially for the vegetarian author)
and crushing boredom of life in the field are all here.
Williams's particular strength is in putting an observant,
distaff spin on the bantering and brutality of barracks life,
where kids from the Survivor generation must come to terms with
a grim and confusing reality over which they have little
control."

Not only will you be getting one or two of the best war memoirs
written in recent years, but you'll be helping VoteVets.org to
counter the destructive policies wrought by the Bush
administration. We can't run TV ads, we can't expand into all 50
states, and we can't bring Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to
Washington to tell our elected leaders what needs to be done
overseas without your help. And that's why we need to raise
$50,000 this week. So if you can, please consider making a
donation now!

Thank you for all of your support.

Sincerely,

Peter Granato

Vice Chairman, http://www.VoteVets.org

Iraq veteran
