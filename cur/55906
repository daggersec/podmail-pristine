Not at all.  I'd add climate change as at least as compelling a long term e=
conomic as well as environmental challenge and I'm in a little different pl=
ace on SS. I think you have to strengthen for the poor and most of the next=
 decade is really about ssdi so we should be clear about that.  But I agree=
 with most of what you are worried about.

Erskine,

Thank you so much for these thoughtful notes! Gives me stuff to think about=
. Glad for you that you won't be called this direction over the summer, but=
 sorry for me -- definitely our loss!

I hope you have lots of fun this summer with the family, and get at least a=
 little rest and relaxation too.

See you soon!
All the best,
Becky

Katie. Happily for me no NY this summer. I'm on two large corporate boards =
that hold all their meetings in NY , thankfully except for the ones in late=
 July -- having lived in the City for 12 years I'm certainly grateful for t=
hat. Our PE firm business also takes me to NY more than I wish ,but happily=
 none are now scheduled in NY. I will however be there plenty in the fall.
If I come to the show , I'd hope to focus on the need to get these politica=
l candidates in both parties to discuss the following fiscal issues :
(1) Before doing anything else how to spend the money we are spending now m=
ore wisely ( something business , not for profits , and families in general=
 must focus on and federal budgets largely ignore );
(2) How to reform our tax code in a progressive manner such that America be=
comes more globally competitive and we produce more revenue ;
(3) How to slow the rate of growth of health care spending and to make Soci=
al Security sustainably solvent ( It's $800b cash negative over the next de=
cade ) so it will actually be there for the people who need it ;
(4) How to at least partially replace the mindless , senseless , across the=
 board cuts in the Sequester with more rational cuts in other mandatory ite=
ms ( no business makes their cuts across the board , they make them surgica=
lly reducing those which will have the least adverse effect on productivity=
 ) ;
(5) How to use these additional resources to (a) reduce the debt , and (b) =
make the smart investments we must in defense , education , infrastructure =
, and high value added research so America is secure and globally competiti=
ve ; and
(6) How they envision increasing economic mobility in the US ( today if you=
 are in the bottom 5th of the income level in America your child is 5 times=
 less likely to get to the top 5th compared to a child born to parents in t=
he top 5th ( Warren's " lucky gene pool" ) , but if that kid born in the bo=
ttom 5th of the income level in America and gets a college degree that kid =
is 3 times more likely to move to the top .
(7) These are the issues I'm concerned about today. I believe if MY generat=
ion doesn't put the ultra partisanship on the Left and Right aside and pull=
 together , not apart , and make some of these really tough decisions , WE =
will be the first generation of Americans to leave the Country worse off th=
an we found it.

Hi Erskine,
Hoping all is well with you since we spoke last in February.  We'd love to =
have you on CNBC's Squawk Box when you're next in town, for a longer chat. =
 Would be great for you to see our new midtown studio!

Let me know if your schedule allows it and talk soon,
Katie

Thanks, Erskine, so much for the reply and I've passed on your thoughts to =
Becky.  Happy to work with you when this fits in your NY schedule. I know w=
hat you mean, it's another dark season in Washington, but your outlook soun=

All best,

Katie. I will do this when I'm up there for a board meeting. I'd hope to ti=
e it to a time when anything remotely positive was possible in Washington. =
While there are numerous action forcing events on the horizon , it looks mi=
ghty dark now. I still feel the politics on both sides will drive the need =
to have positive accomplishments to point to that can only be done through =
legislation -- The president for legacy reasons and the Republican majoriti=
es to prove they can actually govern and thereby protect those majorities a=
nd Chairmanships. We will see.
Thank Becky for me. I will email you when I see a window. Erskine

Hi Erskine -

Hope all is well with you.  Becky Quick asked me to reach out - she enjoyed=
 seeing you at the Alfalfa Dinner a few weeks ago! - do you have any plans =
to come to New York this winter or spring?  We'd love to have you join us a=
s a guest co-host for an hour of Squawk Box when you're free.  We've moved =
to a great new studio in midtown at the corner of 51st Street and 6th Avenu=
e,  so can save you the trip to NJ!

Are there any dates coming up that may work?  We are live between 6 am and =
9 am ET each weekday morning.

Thanks so much, and all the best,
Katie

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span><span style=3D"color:#1f497d">Katie. I will do=
 this when I'm up there for a board meeting. I'd hope to tie it to a time w=
hen anything remotely positive was possible in Washington. While there are =
numerous action forcing events on the
 horizon , it looks mighty dark now. I still feel the politics on both side=
s will drive the need to have positive accomplishments to point to that can=
 only be done through legislation -- The president for legacy reasons and t=
he Republican majorities to prove
 they can actually govern and thereby protect those majorities and Chairman=
ships. We will see.
<br>
Thank Becky for me. I will email you when I see a window. Erskine</span></s=
