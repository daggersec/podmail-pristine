Said no.  She was terribly flattered, etc., but she's one year into a 5-year commitment as dean at Univ of Michigan, just moved her family back from DC to Michigan and regrets that this is the wrong time to take on something like this.

I didn't let her say no during the first call, but after consulting with her husband and thinking about it, she called back.  She, of course, would like to be helpful from where she is, etc.

John, I don't how you want to go back to him on things like this.  I don't think there is another candidate of color who folks would be comfortable putting up as Chair, though either Ceci or Peter (as a stretch) could be a Member.

Thoughts?
