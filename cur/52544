McCain Taps Lobbyist for Transition By Michael Scherer/WASHINGTON

A prominent Washington lobbyist who has worked for every Republican
president since Richard Nixon has been tapped by the McCain campaign to
conduct a study in preparation for the presidential transition, should =
John
McCain win the election, according to sources familiar with the process.

William E. Timmons, Sr. is a Washington institution, having worked in =
the
Nixon and Ford administrations as an aide for congressional relations, =
and
assisted the transition teams of both Ronald Reagan in 1980 and George =
W.
Bush in 2000. He was also a senior adviser to both Vice President George
Bush in 1988 and Senator Bob Dole in 1996.

Timmons is the chairman-emeritus of Timmons and Company, a small but
influential lobbying firm he founded in 1975, shortly after leaving the
White House. According to Senate records, he registered to lobby in 2008 =
for
a wide range of companies and trade groups, including the American =
Petroleum
Institute, the American Medical Association, Chrysler, Freddie Mac, Visa
USA, and Anheuser-Busch.

His registrations include work on a number of issues that have become
flashpoints in the presidential campaign. He has registered to work on =
bills
that deal with the regulations of troubled mortgage lenders Freddie Mac =
and
Fannie Mae; a bill to provide farm subsidies; and bills that regulate
domestic oil drilling.

By tapping Timmons, McCain has turned to one of Washington's steadiest =
and
most senior inside players to guide him in the event of a victory - but =
also
to someone who would represent the antithesis of the kind of
outside-of-Washington change he has recently been promising. One =
Republican
familiar with the process said the decision to involve Timmons could =
become
a political liability for the campaign's reformist image, especially in =
the
wake of the controversies over the lobbying backgrounds of other McCain
staffers, including campaign manager Rick Davis. "It's one more blind =
spot
for Rick Davis and John McCain," the person said.

Under the McCain campaign's conflict of interest rules, announced in =
May,
lobbyists who volunteer for the campaign must disclose their clients, =
agree
not to lobby the campaign or McCain's Senate office, and refrain from
"involvement in any campaign policy-making on the subjects for which =
they
are registered."

Timmons, who is not leading the effort, is working on the McCain =
transition
planning with former Navy Secretary John Lehman, Jr., a friend and =
traveling
companion of McCain's, who runs an investment bank and recently served =
on
the national commission that investigated the terrorist attacks of =
September
11, 2001.

McCain campaign communications director, Jill Hazelbaker, said in an =
Email
that the campaign would not comment on news stories about the transition
process. Messages left at Timmons' office and home Thursday afternoon =
were
not returned. A spokesman for Lehman referred questions to McCain =
campaign
manager Rick Davis.

It is typical for presidential campaigns to begin working on the =
transition
effort months before the election, given the short window available to =
set
up a new government between election day and the inauguration. The Obama
campaign has also started a transition planning effort, recruiting John
Podesta, a former chief of staff to President Clinton who now runs a =
liberal
think tank, the Center for American Progress, to help oversee the
preparation.
