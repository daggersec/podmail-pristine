Thanks for reaching out David,=20

The following is a business memo based upon a discussion I had with my lawy=
er yesterday about what will create the least problems legally for me and f=
or you, my thoughts on what is workable for me and the input you have given=
 me throughout our numerous conversations on what you want. =20

The goals of this memo are as follows: =20

1) To eliminate conflict -- To not create a scenario where I am responsible=
 for the budget of the IE  and therefore in conflict with you all the time =
on if we are hitting your  goals.

2) To help  you to begin aggressively raising funds immediately, -- so as t=
o get in as much money in the door  as early as possible in early January s=
o we can begin operating

3) To give you the flexibility to hire whoever you want whenever you want t=
o IE's  fund-raising without having any tension or conflict with me about i=
t.

4) To give you and me the ability to say that the IE is not paying high pri=
ced consultants with donor funds.

5) To give me the financial security and incentive to continue to raise as =
much money as possible for the C3 and C4 and my part of the IE.

6) To give me the comfort to know that donors I have introduced you to are =
not being turned over to other fund-raisers.

7) To allow us to do this "together" which you and I have always agreed tha=
t we want. =20


Based upon my lawyers advice, I actually think we can do something quite si=
mple. =20

We would leave the C3 contract alone knowing that we might have some donors=
 who will give to the IE instead of the C3 thus affecting my commission.  I=
 have simply decided to not worry if my commissions goes down -- it is fine=
, I will make it up in other ways.=20

We would leave the C4 contract alone but we would use the rule we have alwa=
ys used.  "If a donor comes into the C4 who is not one of "our people" (so =
introduced by someone else) -  I will simply not charge for them.  I have c=
onfidence in this because actually the easiest thing about or relationship =
for 6 years is that we have virtually never had contention over the payment=
 on a contribution.

On the IE -- I would solicit a predetermined list of donors (which would in=
clude all of the funders that are "our" list that we work with you on now -=
 current donors and real prospects).  We could be paid as little as the law=
yers would allow.

You could then hire a fleet of fund-raising consultants across the country =
to do a very deep dive into multiple states to get as many other donors as =
possible to give. =20

Additionally, this structure would allow  people like Susie McCue the confi=
dence to give her names and solicit for us since I would not be being paid =
for or adding her people to my lists to solicit.

I believe that this would allow you and I to have a SIMPLE work relationshi=
p: since for the IE --  basically I will only be working on a predetermined=
 list that are clearly our prospects together.    I will then  give you a s=
trategy for each prospect on the predetermined list and you can change it a=
ny way you want, and decide where you want to ask for the donation go and t=
hen I can just implement.

Under this scenario I will continue to prospect new funders - but only for =
the C3 and C4 thus eleviating any conflict with you other IE fund raisers o=
ver who knows a given prospect better or would have a better chance getting=
 them.  They can just do everyone else.

I believe this scenario is very simple, alleviates all opportunity for tens=
ion, gives us the best opportunity to continue to work together easily, all=
ows us to again have fun working together,  and allows you to have an advis=
or whose motivation you can again trust completely since everything is pre-=
decided on my part of the fund-raising and you basically control the strate=
gy with each of the people on "our" list from the beginning.=20

Additionally, it gives you the flexibility to have you help me with as much=
 political and big picture strategy around the IE and you want since it wil=
l be clear from the beginning what I am doing and therefore also clear I am=
 not angling for anything.

I hope this meets your goals and can again put our work relationship on tra=
ck.

Mary Pat


PS.  Please feel free to share this with Matt and Dave if you want to.  Sin=
ce they were both in the lawyers meeting - they can see if there is any int=
ersection between their thoughts and this.=
