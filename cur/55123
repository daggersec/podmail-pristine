John, this is the first of many articles over the next few months about
Honda's pay to play scandal.  It's going to get worse....it doesn't help
the Party and not HRC, certainly not here in Silicon Valley

Just wanted you to be in the loop.  Any thoughts?  Normally, most
congressmen/women step aside when it's gotten to OCE.  Honda's very
stubborn and naive.  Per our conversation in your home, any chance that you
or other "leaders" might start having some tough/direct conversations?

BTW, Ro raised $1.25mm in the last two quarters (most, not as a
candidate).  Has >$1mm COH.  Raising war chest if this goes to the end.  I
hope it doesn't....

Hope you're well.

Best,
Steve

Mike Honda narrowly defeated Ro Khanna
<http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2014/11/07/mike-honda-declares-victory/> last
fall for a seventh consecutive term in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Both men have already announced their intention to run again in 2016, but
the congressman may have to justify his record to more than voters.

For the last several months, the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) has
been reviewing alleged improper coordination between Honda=E2=80=99s campai=
gn and
his official House staff. Whether this review leads to a broader
investigation or discipline against the congressman is uncertain, due to
the secretive nature and malleable timelines in which the OCE carries out
its business. While the OCE does not comment on pending matters, Honda=E2=
=80=99s
office acknowledged on Tuesday that a review has been taking place.

=E2=80=9CThe congressman and his staff continue to cooperate fully with the=
 OCE=E2=80=99s
review of the matter,=E2=80=9D said Lauren Smith, a spokesperson in Honda=
=E2=80=99s office.
=E2=80=9COut of respect for the process, we cannot confirm specifics or dis=
cuss any
details at this time.=E2=80=9D

In September 2014, San Jose Inside reported emails
<http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2014/09/24/mike-honda-staff-campaign-violate-=
rules-on-coordination/>
that
showed Honda=E2=80=99s longtime chief of staff, Jennifer Van der Heide, and=
 other
House employees coordinated with Honda=E2=80=99s re-election campaign on
invitations to an official State Department event. The goal, according to
the emails, was to target influential South Asian donors for campaign
contributions.

In an email to Honda=E2=80=99s then-campaign manager, Lamar Heystek, as wel=
l as
House district director Meri Maben, Van der Heidi wrote: =E2=80=9CGreat lis=
ts=E2=80=94how
are we doing outreach to them for $?=E2=80=9D

[image: Screen Shot 2014-09-24 at 12.37.07 PM]










According to the House Ethics Manual, =E2=80=9C[A] solicitation for campaig=
n or
political contributions may not be linked with an official action taken or
to be taken by a House Member or employee, and a Member may not accept any
contribution that is linked with an action that the Member has taken or is
being asked to take.=E2=80=9D

In the final weeks of last year=E2=80=99s race, Honda repeatedly dodged int=
erviews
on the matter. Instead, he made vague references to being disappointed and
noting his staff apologized
<http://www.mercurynews.com/nation-world/ci_26644324/hondas-chief-staff-apo=
logizes-email-exchange-political-director>
.

Additional emails provided last fall by Ruchit Agrawal, a disgruntled
former staffer, suggested that Honda routinely had House staffers carry out
personal errands for the congressman on taxpayer time, which is also a
violation of House rules.

Multiple sources have confirmed that OCE investigative counsel Scott Gast
contacted them in the process of the review. Nailing down when any findings
will be made public, if ever, is tricky.

Rod Sinks and Jose Esteves, respective mayors of Cupertino and Milpitas,
filed a formal complaint with the OCE in September. Sinks received a
receipt for that response in December from Paul Solis, the OCE=E2=80=99s de=
puty
chief counsel. From there, at least two of the seven-person appointed OCE
Board would have to recommend a first-phase review. The first board meeting
of the year took place Jan. 29, and sources tell San Jose Inside they were
contacted by OCE staff shortly after that date.

The board then had 30 days to decide if it wants to advance the review to a
=E2=80=9Csecond phase,=E2=80=9D which would offer up to an additional 59 da=
ys to
investigate the matter. That appears to have happened. On March 25, Gast
and Solis met with Agrawal to discuss his time working in Honda=E2=80=99s d=
istrict
office, according to a transcript of that meeting
<http://www.sanjoseinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/March-25-OCE-Inter=
view-Transcript.pdf>
.

Where the review goes from here is particularly hard to pinpoint. The OCE
declined to say when its board has met beyond a quarterly report covering
the first three months of the year. If the board feels that a second-phase
review did not warrant a further investigation, or detect any wrongdoing,
it=E2=80=99s possible that no documents will ever be made public.

However, sources say they were in contact with OCE staff throughout the
spring. If transgressions are identified, the board could issue its own
report or it could transfer findings to the House Ethics Committee to take
up the investigation.

While no one has been required to speak with OCE investigators up to this
point, including Honda, a broader investigation would provide subpoena
power.
