Dear ARPA-E Brain Trustees,
After having spent 2 fabulous years working at Google, which involved
creating a new energy technology initiative that will lead to products and
business in the near future, and after helping recruit my replacement at
Google and passing the baton, I finally joined Stanford full-time August
1st.

While I will continue helping Google in their energy efforts, I am
delighted to be at Stanford now and I look forward to starting a new
chapter enabling and empowering students through teaching and research, and
serving the broader community via industry/business, government and public
engagements.  Kindly note my coordinates below.

Thanks for all your help and counsel during those memorable and
extraordinary days (2009-2012) at ARPA-E. Your engagement and involvement
was most helpful during the birth and growth of ARPA-E. I just hope the
Senate confirms the Director nominee, Dr. Ellen Williams, soon (it has been
8 months since her confirmation hearing) and I hope you will remain engaged
in ARPA-E in the future as well.

Best regards,
Arun
