earth



This summer=2C for the first time since the Apollo 17 mission=2C NASA publi=
shed
pictures of the Earth captured in a single frame. They show our =E2=80=9Cbl=
ue
marble=E2=80=9D shining brightly in the darkness and vastness of space =E2=
=80=94 a view of
our world beamed by a satellite one million miles away. The pictures remind
us all that our life here is mysterious=2C fragile=2C and worth fighting fo=
r.



His Holiness Pope Francis calls Earth =E2=80=9Cour common home.=E2=80=9D =
=E2=80=9COur common home
requires our striving for the common good=2C=E2=80=9D Social Service Sr. Si=
mone
Campbell=2C one of the Nuns on the Bus=2C wrote earlier this year.

Other faith traditions believe this=2C too =E2=80=94 including mine. As a M=
ethodist=2C
I was taught that we have a sacred duty to care for God=E2=80=99s earth. =
=E2=80=9CAll
creation is the Lord=E2=80=99s=2C=E2=80=9D say the Methodist social princip=
les=2C =E2=80=9Cand we are
responsible for the way we use and abuse it.=E2=80=9D



As a person of faith=2C a mother=2C and a grandmother=2C I am deeply moved =
by
Pope Francis=E2=80=99 recent teachings on climate change =E2=80=94 to refle=
ct and above all
to act.



The effects of climate change are too obvious to ignore. We can see them
with our own eyes=2C in our own communities. In California=2C higher
temperatures have worsened a brutal drought=2C which has lasted four years
and shows no signs of abating. In New York=2C flooding from Hurricane Sandy
was made worse by the fact that New York Harbor is nearly a foot higher now
than it was 100 years ago. In Alaska=2C villages that were settled before t=
he
United States even existed are facing imminent destruction because of a
rising ocean=2C retreating ice and more violent storms.



Pope Francis is right. All countries and all people are responsible for
preventing the worst impacts of climate change. But countries like the
United States have a particular role. We are rich=2C powerful=2C and blesse=
d
with many advantages. We must lead the charge.



Climate change will have serious economic and public health consequences
for the United States =E2=80=94 but that=E2=80=99s nothing compared to what=
 some other
countries face. At the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009=2C I listened =
as
the leaders of small island nations like the Maldives pleaded for the world
to act. Otherwise=2C they said=2C our homelands will cease to exist. Rising
seas will engulf us.

I=E2=80=99ve met with leaders from Africa=E2=80=99s Sahel region. Droughts =
there have
created millions of climate refugees.



For the first time in history=2C we are within reach of eradicating hunger
and extreme poverty. But climate change threatens that progress.



Thanks to President Obama=E2=80=99s leadership=2C the United States is rall=
ying the
world to act. Now Pope Francis is bringing his extraordinary moral
leadership to the fight.



I=E2=80=99m grateful =E2=80=94 as so many Americans are =E2=80=94 for the p=
ope=E2=80=99s teachings. And as
president=2C I hope to follow his example. I will make combating climate
change a top priority of my administration.



We=E2=80=99ve made progress in promoting clean energy. Now we must do more =
to help
developing countries embrace lower-carbon fuel sources=2C and continue to
pick up our pace at home.



We=E2=80=99ve made progress in managing our lands and waters. Now we must d=
o more
to protect our global forest=2C which is still being slashed and burned=2C =
and
our global ocean=2C which is growing more acidic=2C threatening the lives a=
nd
livelihoods of billions of people.



We=E2=80=99ve made progress in cleaning our air over the last 40 years. Now=
 we must
do more to protect our poorest and most vulnerable citizens =E2=80=94 inclu=
ding the
elderly=2C children and communities of color =E2=80=94 from the worst healt=
h effects
of climate change.



But in spite of the strongest possible scientific consensus about what
climate change means for our environment=2C economy=2C health=2C and future=
=2C
there are still some who deny the facts. They=E2=80=99re intent on obstruct=
ing
progress.



We can=E2=80=99t let them win this fight. We have no choice. There is no Pl=
anet B.



We need to develop an ethic of stewardship=2C of responsibility and
sustainability =E2=80=94 in our businesses=2C in our governments=2C and as =
citizens of
the earth. The scale of the challenge we face demands nothing less.



The great American conservationist John Muir wrote=2C =E2=80=9CEverybody ne=
eds beauty
as well as bread=2C places to play in and pray in=2C where nature may heal =
and
give strength to body and soul.=E2=80=9D Climate change threatens every pla=
ce on
our planet=2C from majestic landscapes to ordinary city streets. It threate=
ns
every facet of our economy=E2=80=94our agriculture=2C energy=2C transportat=
ion and
tourism. And most importantly=2C it threatens the health=2C happiness=2C an=
d
future of every one of our children.



I want my granddaughter Charlotte to know that her grandmother did
everything possible to protect and preserve God=E2=80=99s gift to us=2C thi=
s
beautiful planet=2C our common home. That=E2=80=99s why I=E2=80=99m in this=
 fight. And I want
all children everywhere=2C in countries large and small=2C to know the same
thing about their leaders.



This week=2C as Pope Francis visits the White House=2C Congress and the Uni=
ted
Nations=2C I urge Americans of every faith and political persuasion to list=
en
to what he has to say. Heed his message of God=E2=80=99s love for all creat=
ures.
Follow his urging to become good stewards of the earth. And do your part to
fulfill our shared responsibility to our planet=2C our children=2C and our
future.
