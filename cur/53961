FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 2nd, 2008

P.O.W. IMPRISONED WITH MCCAIN GOES ON RECORD: "P.O.W. EXPERIENCE NOT
PREREQUISITE FOR PRESIDENT" (VIDEO).  TV AD BUY TO FOLLOW.

Dr. Philip Butler on McCain:

"I think I can say with authority that the Prisoner Of War experience
is not a good prerequisite for President."

"John McCain is not somebody I would like to see with his finger near
the red button."

LOS ANGELES - Dr. Philip Butler, a highly decorated combat veteran who
was imprisoned alongside John McCain at the infamous 'Hanoi Hilton'
prison in Vietnam, has gone on record with his opinion of the GOP
presidential candidate in a short video interview with Brave New PAC.
This morning, Brave New PAC will send the video to its email list of
500,000 people, and is preparing for a national TV ad buy.

Dr. Butler was shot down over North Vietnam in April, 1965 and was
brought to the Hanoi Hilton prison, two and a half years prior to
McCain's arrival. He spent eight years in captivity. Butler is
critical of McCain's habitual use of his P.O.W. story to advance his
presidential campaign. "John has allowed I think the media to make him
out to be the P.O.W., the hero, and in fact there were over 600 just
like him who performed just as well." Echoing a similar assertion from
General Wesley Clark two months ago, Butler continues, "I think I can
say with authority that the Prisoner Of War experience is not a good
prerequisite for President of the United States."

Having lived across the hall from John McCain at the U.S. Naval
Academy prior to combat, Butler was a close witness to McCain's
famously volatile temperament. "He was very sensitive and touchy and
just easy to anger," says Dr. Butler. "John McCain is not somebody I
would like to see with his finger near the red button." Butler
continues, "John McCain's temperament makes it clear that he is not
cut out to be President of the United States."

Butler points to the health risks faced by former Prisoners Of War as
another cause for concern about a McCain presidency - a concern
publicly heightened in recent days by McCain's selection of a
political novice as a running mate.  "The data show that the Prisoner
Of War group are dying at an earlier age and that we suffer lots of
residual things that non-P.O.W. group really doesn't have to deal
with.  And it's imperative that we have someone who is healthy and can
stand the rigors of that job."

Other military veterans agree with Butler's criticism of McCain's
exploitation of his P.O.W. story. Writes Brandon Friedman, a veteran
of both Iraq and Afghanistan and author of 'The War I Always Wanted':
"To see McCain resort to playing the POW card when answering
legitimate questions, in my mind, cheapens that experience.  And by
cheapening his own experience in war, he degrades all of our
experiences in war.  He turns the horrific incidents we've all seen,
touched, smelled, and felt into a lame excuse to earn political
points.  And it dishonors us all."
