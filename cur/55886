Doc,
My blood pressure has come down on the amlodipine. The systolic varies betwe=
en 121-151; the diastolic between 81-85. But I am having some side effects w=
hich I thought I should report in. My ankles are swelling some although I ha=
ve also flown 20,000 miles or more in the past few weeks. I also have itchin=
g on my ankles, wrists and particularly on and around my ears. More annoying=
 than severe. Anything to worry about?
John
