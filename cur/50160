Frank--first of all, thanks for being there and for all your help so
far.  This is a fair point and one that other raised after the
meeting.  Dennis--let's discuss.

Result is that donors don't feel like the campaign thinks they're important. This spreads. Squashes enthusiasm. We need more people singing her praises. Elite donors are the ambassadors of the campaign. People are taking their cue from them. Right now, a lot of the donors we need are not engaged.  We should plan a couple of follow up mtgs where the Secretary can briefly stop in and say hello. This can probably be in DC  or NY.
