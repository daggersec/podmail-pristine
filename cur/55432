BHP in free trade crusade
Mackenzie warns against protectionism
The Australian
7 Februrary 2014

By Annabel Hepworth

BHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie has declared that ``an evange=
lism'' is required to resist protectionism and capture the benefits of free=
 trade that underpin economic growth and jobs creation.

Mr Mackenzie, who chairs the B20 trade taskforce that will make recommendat=
ions for this year's G20 agenda, said the group wanted to ensure there was =
``at least a standstill'' on protectionism.

He also pledged that the taskforce would have a stronger focus on the trade=
 in services, saying ``if you close a laboratory door you deny yourself acc=
ess to more ideas than you deny your competitors''.

``Although the world does move forward in a fairly slow way, to capture som=
e of the benefits of free trade it quite frequently takes steps backwards, =
and there is a degree of protectionism,'' Mr Mackenzie said.

``And so vigilance and, if you like, an evangelism, of sorts, are certainly=
 required.''

Mr Mackenzie's comments came as Joe Hockey yesterday vowed that Australia w=
ould ``play to its strengths'' in its leadership role of the G20 and the Mi=
nerals Council of Australia warned the Abbott government that domestic prot=
ectionism could threaten the success of export industries such as mining.

In a pre-budget submission, obtained by The Australian, the Minerals Counci=
l urges Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb to be a strong advocate f=
or open markets ``to counter protectionist sentiment''.

The submission also backs the government's push for the early conclusion of=
 free trade agreements with Japan and China, and the Trans-Pacific Partners=
hip.

Mr Hockey said that while there was reform fatigue in many G20 countries, A=
ustralia's focus would be on improving the environment for growth, includin=
g policies to enhance trade.

``The best way to promote stronger economic growth is by unlocking private =
sector-led growth through more investment and free trade,'' Mr Hockey said.

In line with this free trade message, Mr Mackenzie said the B20 trade taskf=
orce felt it had a strong obligation ``to reassert the economic and social =
benefits of free trade, and therefore the pitfalls and dangers of protectio=
nism''.

``And I guess we certainly agreed as a group that -- you know, we can't say=
 this enough.''

Mr Mackenzie this week held the first meeting of the taskforce, with 45 of =
his counterparts from Europe and Middle East, Australia and Asia, North and=
 South America.

Outlining priority areas yesterday, Mr Mackenzie said the taskforce was foc=
used on a few key themes as it wants to put forward a small number of pract=
ical recommendations aimed at increasing trade.

As well as advocating for trade liberalisation and supporting nations to re=
sist protectionism, the taskforce will focus on: lowering supply chain barr=
iers; the trade in services; and turning preferential deals between trading=
 blocs into multilateral agreements so that multiple nations are party to t=
hem.

On the push on trade in services, there are concerns that while services ac=
count for a growing share of global GDP, as a proportion of international t=
rade flows, they are still disproportionately small.

``As somebody who previously worked in research, I was always keen on the m=
axim -- I've forgot who actually said it -- but if you close a laboratory d=
oor you deny yourself access to more ideas than you deny your competitors,'=
' Mr Mackenzie said. ``And I think in a more networked world, services and =
ideas and the trade in them happening more easily will certainly accelerate=
.''

Wesfarmers managing director and B20 Australia chairman Richard Goyder has =
previously said an international trade agreement on services is crucial.

Mr Goyder has singled out the need for expansion of the Information Technol=
ogy Agreement.

On addressing the proliferation of agreements and making sure these coalesc=
ed into global agreements, Mr Mackenzie said this was an area where the tas=
kforce hoped to make progress.

``Certainly for a company like BHP Billiton, it's incredibly important . . =
. our iron ore can be sold to one country to make steel. The steel can then=
 be onsold to a second country . . . And therefore you meet lots of trade a=
greements. Be good if that was all part of something that was more omnipres=
ent, and more global.''

Meanwhile, in its pre-budget submission, the Minerals Council calls on the =
government to cut unnecessary impediments to cross-border business.

``While tariff protection has remained broadly stable in Australia over rec=
ent years, protectionist policy pressures have found other outlets, includi=
ng through more restrictive anti-dumping laws, government subsidies to sele=
ct industries, greater bureaucratic intervention in local purchasing decisi=
ons, notably applying to major project developers in the resources industry=
, and in efforts to further restrict skilled migration,'' the submission sa=
ys.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">BHP Billiton chief exec=
utive Andrew Mackenzie has declared that ``an evangelism'' is required to r=
esist protectionism and capture the benefits of free trade
 that underpin economic growth and jobs creation.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Mr Mackenzie, who chair=
s the B20 trade taskforce that will make recommendations for this year's G2=
0 agenda, said the group wanted to ensure there was ``at least
 a standstill'' on protectionism.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">He also pledged that th=
e taskforce would have a stronger focus on the trade in services, saying ``=
if you close a laboratory door you deny yourself access to
 more ideas than you deny your competitors''.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">``Although the world do=
es move forward in a fairly slow way, to capture some of the benefits of fr=
ee trade it quite frequently takes steps backwards, and there
 is a degree of protectionism,'' Mr Mackenzie said.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">``And so vigilance and,=
 if you like, an evangelism, of sorts, are certainly required.''</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Mr Mackenzie's comments=
 came as Joe Hockey yesterday vowed that Australia would ``play to its stre=
ngths'' in its leadership role of the G20 and the Minerals
 Council of Australia warned the Abbott government that domestic protection=
ism could threaten the success of export industries such as mining.</span><=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In a pre-budget submiss=
ion, obtained by The Australian, the Minerals Council urges Trade and Inves=
tment Minister Andrew Robb to be a strong advocate for open
 markets ``to counter protectionist sentiment''.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The submission also bac=
ks the government's push for the early conclusion of free trade agreements =
with Japan and China, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Mr Hockey said that whi=
le there was reform fatigue in many G20 countries, Australia's focus would =
be on improving the environment for growth, including policies
 to enhance trade.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">``The best way to promo=
te stronger economic growth is by unlocking private sector-led growth throu=
gh more investment and free trade,'' Mr Hockey said.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">In line with this free =
trade message, Mr Mackenzie said the B20 trade taskforce felt it had a stro=
ng obligation ``to reassert the economic and social benefits
 of free trade, and therefore the pitfalls and dangers of protectionism''.<=
/span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">``And I guess we certai=
nly agreed as a group that -- you know, we can't say this enough.''</span><=
/p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Mr Mackenzie this week =
held the first meeting of the taskforce, with 45 of his counterparts from E=
urope and Middle East, Australia and Asia, North and South
 America.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Outlining priority area=
s yesterday, Mr Mackenzie said the taskforce was focused on a few key theme=
s as it wants to put forward a small number of practical recommendations
 aimed at increasing trade.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">As well as advocating f=
or trade liberalisation and supporting nations to resist protectionism, the=
 taskforce will focus on: lowering supply chain barriers;
 the trade in services; and turning preferential deals between trading bloc=
s into multilateral agreements so that multiple nations are party to them.<=
/span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">On the push on trade in=
 services, there are concerns that while services account for a growing sha=
re of global GDP, as a proportion of international trade flows,
 they are still disproportionately small.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">``As somebody who previ=
ously worked in research, I was always keen on the maxim -- I've forgot who=
 actually said it -- but if you close a laboratory door you
 deny yourself access to more ideas than you deny your competitors,'' Mr Ma=
ckenzie said. ``And I think in a more networked world, services and ideas a=
nd the trade in them happening more easily will certainly accelerate.''</sp=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Wesfarmers managing dir=
ector and B20 Australia chairman Richard Goyder has previously said an inte=
rnational trade agreement on services is crucial.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Mr Goyder has singled o=
ut the need for expansion of the Information Technology Agreement.</span></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">On addressing the proli=
feration of agreements and making sure these coalesced into global agreemen=
ts, Mr Mackenzie said this was an area where the taskforce
 hoped to make progress.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">``Certainly for a compa=
ny like BHP Billiton, it's incredibly important . . . our iron ore can be s=
old to one country to make steel. The steel can then be onsold
 to a second country . . . And therefore you meet lots of trade agreements.=
 Be good if that was all part of something that was more omnipresent, and m=
ore global.''</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Meanwhile, in its pre-b=
udget submission, the Minerals Council calls on the government to cut unnec=
essary impediments to cross-border business.</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span lang=3D"EN-AU" style=3D"font-size:11.0pt; font=
-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">``While tariff protecti=
on has remained broadly stable in Australia over recent years, protectionis=
t policy pressures have found other outlets, including through
 more restrictive anti-dumping laws, government subsidies to select industr=
ies, greater bureaucratic intervention in local purchasing decisions, notab=
ly applying to major project developers in the resources industry, and in e=
fforts to further restrict skilled
 migration,'' the submission says.</span></p>
