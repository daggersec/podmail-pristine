I spoke w Arianna abt PMUSA Board and will send her more info. She is enthusiastic abt the project but asks if she's more useful to us not being on the Board and, instead, using Huffpo to echo our message without any perceived conflicts. She has a point. We'll keep talking.  She liked the Geffen idea. He's on his boat and returns May 9. She'll make the ask.  Steve - I had good talk w Jeff A abt logo.
