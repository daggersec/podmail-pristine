Hi John,

I wanted to reach out to say thanks for the principled and nuanced stance
the Secretary took last night on encryption and the tech sector. Leadership
at Apple certainly noticed and I am sure that is true though out the Valley=
.

Please know that Apple will continue its work with law enforcement. We
share law enforcement's concerns about the threat to citizens and we work
closely with authorities to comply with legal requests for data that have
helped solve complex crimes. Thousands of times every month, we give
governments information about Apple customers and devices, in response to
warrants and other forms of legal process. We have a team that responds to
those requests 24 hours a day. Strong encryption does not eliminate Apple=
=E2=80=99s
ability to give law enforcement meta-data or any of a number of other very
useful  categories of data.

Tonight, Tim and Apple will be featured on "60 Minutes." We expect
encryption and taxes to be covered.  In previews, Tim reacts strongly to
the  EU tax investigation of Apple and other American companies. We will
amplify encryption messaging tomorrow when we publicly release our comments
on the draft UK Investigatory Powers bill.

Best wishes to you and your family and the HRC family for a peaceful and
joyous holiday season and a prosperous and bright 2016.

Lisa
