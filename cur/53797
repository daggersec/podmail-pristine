Key 2014 Senate races on the line: Donate to GiveGreen candidates today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=hjR1wBnYNX1M_AxHxYE0ag

2014 is one of the toughest Senate maps in a generation. Help environmental champs win! Donate to support GiveGreen candidates: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=bHL8QmG-lFSMsoOK1KeyDQ .

I'm not going to sugarcoat it, John.

We are looking at a brutal Senate map in 2014. Key races in Minnesota, New Hampshire, and other key states are likely to be prime targets for attacks by Karl Rove and the Koch brothers. If we lose any of these seats, our pro-environment Senate firewall could be in jeopardy.

But it's not just about the firewall. It's also about leadership. We helped elect both Al Franken and Jeanne Shaheen in 2008 and they are trusted leaders on climate change. They do the heavy-lifting on legislation, they push the administration for action, and -- most importantly -- they don't back down from a fight.

We need both of them in the Senate for another six years and if we're going to win on November 4, 2014 -- we need to help them right now.

Donate to Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Senator Al Franken via LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen bundling program: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=BupkxRRoG09PfqAgAs19HA .

Don't miss this opportunity -- we need to shore up their financial resources now, so they can get their message out there and respond to the extreme attacks -- and believe me, those attacks are coming soon.

These Senators are among the strongest leaders we have on climate in the Senate. Over the next weeks, months, and years, they will help us find solutions to climate change - and take on Big Oil -- but they can't do it unless we help them get re-elected.

I know you're busy, so here's a real quick run-down on these two races:

Minnesota Senator Al Franken:   Elected in 2008 by only 312 votes, Al Franken could face a huge wave of attacks in 2014. Senator Franken is a champ on environmental issues and has consistently stood up to Big Oil, most recently by cosponsoring the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act, which would eliminate taxpayer funded subsidies to the largest oil companies. Senator Franken's strong record has earned him an impressive 92% lifetime score on LCV's National Environmental Scorecard.  Let's get Al Franken re-elected. Donate to him and other GiveGreen candidates: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=fx95HSdHM-uAvnm57Nt2wQ .

New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen:  Jeanne Shaheen was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008 and has served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and as Chair of the Subcommittee on Water and Power. She co-sponsored a bill to create a national renewable energy standard. Last week the Senate started debating her bipartisan legislation to promote energy efficient technologies -- the first energy bill to be debated on the Senate floor in years -- demonstrating her leadership on moving America's energy agenda forward.  Senator Shaheen's dedication to environmental protection has earned her a 93% lifetime score on LCV's National Environmental Scorecard. Donate to Senator Jeanne Shaheen and all our GiveGreen candidates: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=yJaZRm9w6sFlYGoik9X5dw .

This is one of the toughest election cycles I've ever seen. We may never be able to match the amount of money that Karl Rove and the Koch brothers can spend, but with the help of friends like you, we can make sure that candidates who share our values have the resources they need to win.

Thank you so much for your support of LCV Action Fund and all our GiveGreen candidates.
