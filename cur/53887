      Dear Friend,

   [1][IMG]In many ways, Colorado has the perfect climate: four distinct
   seasons, temperatures moderated by our location and altitude, and (perha=
ps
   my favorite) an overwhelming majority of bright, sunny days throughout t=
he
   year.

   But our idyllic climate comes at a price. Water is a scarce commodity he=
re
   in Colorado like it is across the West. Those sunny days mean we have to
   manage the precious water we do get to make every drop count--for cities,
   farms, and to preserve a healthy environment in our state's lakes and
   rivers. With our state's population set to double in the next 35 years, =
we
   need to get serious now about water conservation.

   Because conservation is the only way we're going to meet the need.

   Right now, the state of Colorado is working on our first ever statewide
   water management plan. Different water drainage basins, such as the Front
   Range and the Colorado River basins, have already submitted regional
   plans. Citizens have a chance to weigh in on Colorado's water future.

   [2]Click here to send a letter to the Colorado Water Conservation Board,
   and tell them that conservation needs to be the highest priority for
   Colorado's water future.

   Water conservation protects Colorado's rivers. Our rivers are a critical
   attraction to our state for tourism and recreation in addition to the
   lifeblood of dependent communities. With a finite supply, obligations to
   downstream states, and exploding urban growth along the Front Range, we
   can't simply divert our way out of this problem in the long run, and
   trying to do so will cause tremendous damage to our environment.

   [3]Make your voice heard right now at the Colorado Water Conservation
   Board: tell them that our statewide water plan must lead with water
   conservation.

   Water conservation works. Did you know that Denver Water has implemented
   successful conservation measures that ratepayers support? Denver Water
   ratepayers use over 20% less water than they did only 12 years ago. If
   Denver can do it, the flourishing suburbs around the city can. And
   agricultural users who account for over 80% of water use in Colorado can.
   Working together, and making the efficient use of every last drop of wat=
er
   our highest priority, we can provide for the next generation's needs.

   [4]Take the first step right now--send a message to the Colorado Water
   Conservation Board, letting them know that water conservation is your
   priority.

   Sincerely,

   Amy Runyon-Harms
