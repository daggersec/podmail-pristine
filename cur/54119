Thanks amigo --  very well framed. I am inclined to let it go, as io
was at the start. But let me think. The sub stantive issue is that the
consultations to date have apparently been "Wkat do you want to do?".
As opposed to, "Obama would prefer X if feasible; what do you think?".
These are very different questions.  I am still worried that what
Jeanne and Tokm are doing is too Hill-centric. Although obviously the
legislation must be written up there.
