Lobbyists For Foreign Corporations Begin Fight To Ensure Foreign Money Can =
Influence American Elections<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/01/27/foreign-lo=
bbying-elections/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2010/01/27/foreign-lobbying-elections/

 Foreign Cash<http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/foreign_e=
xchange1.jpg>Last week, the 5-4 Supreme Court ruling in theCitizens United =
v. Federal Election Commission<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/01/21/citizens=
-united/>decision invalidated a sixty-three year-old ban on corporate money=
 in federal elections. The ruling gives corporations essentially the same r=
ights<http://www.publicintegrity.org/articles/entry/1913/> as individuals i=
n their ability to spend freely on political advertising, even if those adv=
ertisements explicitly advocate the election or defeat of a federal candida=
te. One consequence of this decision is that foreign corporations with U.S.=
-subsidiaries are likely to be able to now spend unlimited amounts on Ameri=
can elections.

Congressional Democrats, led by Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL), Rep. Chris Van Ho=
llen (D-MD), and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), are drafting legislation<http:/=
/www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/22/AR2010012204811.h=
tml?hpid=3Dtopnews> to curb the influence of foreign corporations and forei=
gn governments following the decision. However, the National Journal report=
ed<http://www.nationaljournal.com/congressdaily/coa_20100127_3449.php> toda=
y that corporate lobbyists representing foreign corporations are already or=
ganizing to defeat such a proposal. The Organization for International Inve=
stment, a trade group representing foreign banks<http://www.ofii.org/memlis=
t.htm>, oil companies, and other foreign corporations operating in the Unit=
ed States, "lashed out" at Van Hollen's proposals. "The concern over foreig=
n influence in our political system is a red herring," said Nancy McLernon,=
 the head of OII.

McLernon - who previously worked for<http://www.ofii.org/staff.htm> Citizen=
s for a Sound Economy, a stealth "grassroots" corporate lobbying group now =
known<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/08/27/ahip-lobbying-publicoption/> as A=
mericans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks - is wrong to assert that the dang=
er of foreign lobbying is simply a distraction. For instance, Saudi Arabia =
has already signaled that the progressive effort to build a clean energy Am=
erican economy is its "biggest threat<http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTR=
E60N0YE20100124>":

Saudi Arabia's economy depends on oil exports so stands to be one of the bi=
ggest losers in any pact that curbs oil demand by penalizing carbon emissio=
ns. "It's one of the biggest threats that we are facing," said Muhammed al-=
Sabban, head of the Saudi delegation to U.N. talks on climate change and a =
senior economic adviser to the Saudi oil ministry.[...] Climate talks posed=
 a bigger threat, Sabban said, and subsidies for the development of renewab=
le energy were distorting market economics in the sector, he said.

Presumably because of the Citizens United ruling, Saudi Arabian-owned subsi=
diaries operating in the United States can now spend unlimited amounts advo=
cating the defeat of candidates who support clean energy legislation. Accor=
ding to a ThinkProgress investigation<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/01/13/f=
oreign-oil-tea/>, foreign-oil backed lobbyists in America are already insti=
gating efforts to kill clean energy legislation. Fortunately, President Oba=
ma isexpected<http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0110/32060.html> to addr=
ess the issue of foreign corporations influencing American elections in his=
 State of the Union address tonight.
