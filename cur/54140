Dear John,

My favorite thing about the August recess is getting back home, seeing friends and family, and visiting with New Yorkers across the State.

During the past month, I had the pleasure of traveling with my children, Theo and Henry, from Chautauqua County, at the western edge of the state, straight east through a dozen counties ending up in Columbia County at home in Hudson. We spent time at the Salamanca Rail Museum, the Seneca-Iroquois National Museum, the Corning Museum of Glass, two county fairs, the Seneca Falls Women's Rights National Historical Park, the Baseball Hall of Fame, many farms and vineyards, and the State Fair in Syracuse! I also did several larger public meetings, including a few Senate at your Supermarkets and Economic Development Round Tables. I hope you will take a moment to view this collection of some of my favorite photos from my travels.

As I head back to Washington, I carry with me the hopes and concerns that were shared by those I met along the way - people want comprehensive health care reform that lowers costs for everyone and a continued focus on economic recovery. There is much work to do in D.C. and here at home, and I hope you will continue to join me as we tackle the tough issues facing New York and our nation.

Sincerely,

Kirsten Gillibrand
