Are folks  comfortable offering Victor a private meeting on one of those da=
tes? At this point I get the impression that although I keep saying WJC car=
es about Ukraine, Pinchuk feels like WJC hasn't taken enough action to demo=
nstrate that, particularly during this existential moment for the county an=
d for him.=20
>=20
> I sense this is so important because Pinchuk is under Putin's heel right =
now, feeling a great degree of pressure and pain for his many years of nurt=
uring stronger ties with the West.=20
>=20
> I get all the downsides and share the concerns. I am happy to go back and=
 say no. It would just be good to know what WJC (and HRC and you all) would=
 like to do, because this will likely impact the future of this relationshi=
p, and slow walking our reply will only reinforce his growing angst.=20
