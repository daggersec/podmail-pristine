Dear Law Center Colleagues:

With winter upon us, I wanted to remind you of our Inclement Weather Policy=
 which can be found at:  http://www.law.georgetown.edu/campus-services/publ=
ic-safety/inclement-weather-policy.cfm.  I would like to bring to your atte=
ntion several aspects of this policy.  First, under our policy, the Law Cen=
ter will not follow the Federal Government's schedule with respect to closi=
ngs, and will continue to make weather-related decisions separate from thos=
e of the main campus.  The Law Center will make its own determination on cl=
osings, cancellations, liberal leave and late openings due to inclement wea=
ther giving primary consideration to the safety of our faculty, staff, stud=
ents and visitors.  Second, when Georgetown Law announces a delayed opening=
, the Law Center will open, and faculty and staff (with the exception of em=
ergency employees, who must report to work on time regardless of weather co=
nditions) are expected to arrive, by 11 a.m.  I encourage you to review the=
 policy in its entirety to obtain full details regarding the impact on clas=
ses, special events, and employee work schedules when a weather-related eve=
nt results in a Law Center closing or delayed opening.

All notifications concerning school closure or delayed openings will be mad=
e through the HoyAlert emergency notification system that sends notificatio=
ns by email and text message.  If you have not enrolled in HoyAlert, I urge=
 you to enroll at: http://emergencymanagement.georgetown.edu/HOYAlert.  Ann=
ouncements concerning weather-related closings or delayed openings will als=
o be posted to the Georgetown Law homepage (http://www.law.georgetown.edu/)=
, recorded on the main switchboard number, (202) 662-9000, and the class ca=
ncellation line (202) 662-9446, and sent via the Law Center's e-mail system=
.

Best,
Bill
