and we see the patriotism just shinning through these peoples faces and the
Vietnam veterans wearing their hats so proudly and they have tears in their
eyes as we sing our national anthem and it is so inspiring and I say this i=

true America, you get it, you understand how important it is that in the
next four years we have a leader who will fight for you.  I certainly don't

3.     MSNBC: Chris Matthews on Palin's views of Vice Presidential
Responsibility: "She's talking like a second grader."
4.     CNN: Reports of threats and attacks on ACORN

honorably.

5.     FNC: *Fox and Friends *talk ACORN

GRETCHEN CARLSON: Never. Here's the other problem you guys=85 they're going
out and getting people sign up to vote and we've said on countless occasion=
s
, that is a wonderful mission, we all agree with that but you're not
supposed to go out and sign people up to vote and then say, oh by the way
here's who you should vote for.

6.     FNC: Pfotenhauer and Bill Burton spar on tax policy

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: Barack Obama is a redistributionist, he wants to take
money from some people, put it through the government spin cycle, hand it
back out to others and the problem is his policy will kill jobs. So what
good is your college tax credit if you don't have a job anymore?

7.     NBC: Mitchell looks at what's dragging McCain down

ANDREA MITCHELL: Fully one third of those questioned say Palin raises
concerns about McCain's candidacy compared to 23% who worry McCain would
continue George Bush's policies

8.     MSNBC: Pfotenhauer calls Obama econ plan high tax and higher spendin=
g

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: Well Andrea, it just strikes me as very strange, that
Barack Obama believes that he can somehow change the current economic mess
by taking a policy that has been low taxes and high spending over the last
eight years, and somehow fix it by making it high tax and higher spending.

9.     CNN: CNN talks to Alaska Independence Party leaders

RICK SANCHEZ: The Independence Party's 20-point platform never mentions
secession but repeatedly asks for greater states' rights. Specifically when
it comes to the right of Alaskan's to access public lands, unencumbered. He
says that's why AIP's founder, Joe Vogler said, quote, "The fires of hell
are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government."

10.   MSNBC: George Allen defends Bachman and McCain's poor poll showing

GEORGE ALLEN: Well, it's certainly not Gov. Palin [that's hurting McCain;]
she brings a lot of enthusiastic folks out . . . if the people voting at th=

NASCAR races were an indicator, we're going to be in good shape . . .

11.  FNC: Huckabee thinks McCain can still win by publicizing Obama's sprea=

the wealth comment, O'Reilly thinks the country has turned left and doesn't
mind wealth distribution

MIKE HUCKABEE: Imagine if kids stayed at home and didn't trick or treat.  A=

the kids that went out trick or treating had to give a bout half of their
candy to the kids that didn't bother to get in costume.

*Palin Won't Call Obama a Socialist but Joe did, Obama's Tax Plan "Is Not a
Principle of Capitalism" *(CNN 10/21/08 5:15pm)
DREW GRIFFIN: You get huge crowds, even bigger crowds than John McCain, why
is that?

SARAH PALIN: I think it's what I'm representing and the messages, and that
is true reform of government  that is so needed and having a representative
who has a track record of showing that yeah you can do this, you can reform=
,
you can have a government that is back on the side of the people.  You can
fight corruption, you can actually take steps to helping our nation become
energy independent and all those things that we are talking about, I think
that more and more Americans are realizing that good, we have  a candidate
that has done some of those things and is not just talking the talk, she's
gonna tell us how she's done this.

GRIFFIN: Perfect, lets talk about that because  2 months ago it was all
about who you were and where you were from in Wasilla =85 now its just abou=
t
the economy and you are the only person in this race with executive
experience in this race=85 What will you do day one to tell the American
people things are changing for the better?

PALIN: You know that's a good point about that experience, and we don't lik=
e
to toot our own horns, so I don't talk about my experience that much in
terms of years in office or in positions that have been executive
experience, but I do have more executive experience than Barack Obama does.
You know he had served for his 300 days before he became a presidential
candidate=85 But as an executive working for John McCain we will take on th=
e
special interests=85 We do this economically by cutting taxes, not increasi=
ng
them=85 it works.  You have great oversight making sure there isn't the
corruption and the abuse, but then Government kind of getting out of the wa=
y
and letting the private sector do what it does best.

GRIFFIN: But we are in a crisis right now.

PALIN: We are.

GRIFFIN: And the plans that you mentioned take time, you have to go through
congress, if you guys win you'll most likely be working with a democratic
congress, it's going to be a slow process.  What I'm trying to find out fro=
m
you, from John McCain as well, day one, people want a difference, to make a
difference in the economy=85

PALIN: Well day one you bring in everyone to that table =85 assuming that
there will be democrats at that table and that's good too. =85 I have that
executive experience also formed a cabinet up there in Alaska that, you
know, we've got independents and democrats and republicans and I have
appointed to our administrative positions so that we have the best of ideas
coming together =85

GRIFFIN: Will you and John McCain appoint democrats to your cabinet?

PALIN: I don't know why you wouldn't.  If these democrats are best suited t=
o
serve, and if they will not let obsessive partisanship get in the way of
just doing what's right with a team effort and support of the president to
get this economy moving and to win these wars, to meet these great
challenges=85

GRIFFIN: Joe the Plumber?

PALIN: Yeah

GRIFFIN: Socialism, it's come up on the campaign trail-

PALIN: Sure

GRIFFIN: Do you think Barack Obama is a socialist?

PALIN: I'm not going to call him a socialist but Joe the Plumber has
suggested, In fact he came right out and said it, it sounds like socialism
to him, and he speaks for so many American's who are quit concerned now
after hearing, finally, what Barack Obama's true intentions are with his
tax, economic plan.  And that is to take more from small businesses, more
from our families and redistribute that according to his priorities.  That
is not good for the entrepreneurial spirit that has built this great
country, that is not good for our economy.  =85

GRIFFIN: Do you think his intentions though if not a socialist, would move
away from capitalism, true capitalism?

PALIN: Well anyone that would want to increase taxes at a time like this
especially with the economic woes that are adversely effecting all of us,
anyone who would want to do that, take more from businesses and our familie=
s
and then doll those dollars out according to their priorities, that is not =
a
principle of capitalism. =85

GRIFFIN: Some are already saying that we are moving towards socialism with
the bailout =85

PALIN: We can not keep moving toward socialism =85 that will punish hard wo=
rk
and productivity =85  As far as the bailout=85 it is a crisis and governmen=
t did
have to step in=85

*Todd and Sarah are not at fault in Troopergate, Biden got a free pass for
his International Crisis Comments, All parts of America are equally America=
n
* (CNN 10/21/08 5:15pm)
GRIFFIN: You've been mocked in the press, =85 some conservatives have been
pretty hard on you as well.  The National Review had a story saying that yo=
u
know, I can't tell if Sarah Palin is incompetent, stupid, unqualified,
corrupt or all of the above.

PALIN: Who wrote that one?

GRIFFIN: That was in The National Review, I don't have the author.

PALIN: Who wrote it? I'd like to talk to that person.

GRIFFIN: But they were talking about the fact that your experience as
Governor is not getting out.  Do you feel trapped in this campaign?  Like
your message is not getting out?  So who do you blame?

PALIN:  No I'm getting my message out right now, =85 I am obviously an
outsider of the Washington elite and the, I think, conventional media
targets or media characters that have been a part of this.  And that's fine
=85

GRIFFIN:  =85 Was it a mistake to let your husband use your office to try t=
o
pressure the troopers to fire Mr. Wooten?

PALIN: Not at all.  Because A: the trooper who had tazered his kid and had
made death threats against my family, said he was gong to bring the Governo=
r
down and all that.  My husband did, exactly what, I think what any sensible=
,
reasonable father, husband would do who was concerned about their family's
safety.

GRIFFIN: Was it a mistake to allow him to use the Governor's Office to that
extent?

PALIN: Not when you look at other Governor's track records when they had
their spouse as, for example Governor Murkowski had his spouse as his top
advisor and she was in meetings, she was in the office, you know kind of a
double standard here, but what Todd did was what any reasonable husband and
father would do.  He followed the instruction of the department of public
safety's own personal security detail that is our personal protection.  The=
y
asked Todd, you have a problem with a state trooper, he is a threat, and yo=
u
need to take that to the commissioner of the Department of Public Safety.  =
Todd
did exactly that, and then of course he got clobbered for it now in the
media.  Because there is a misunderstanding of what he has done.  =85 So no=
 I
do not think it was an abuse of power of my office and I was very thankful
that that report cleared me of any illegal dealings=85

[=85]

DREW GRIFFIN: Governor, if in two weeks you're not elected, do you come bac=
k
at the top of the ticket in 2012.

SARAH PALIN: I'm concerned about and focused on just the next two weeks,
Drew, and getting that message out there to the American public, thankfully
too, the American public is seeing clearer and clearer what the choices are
in these tickets. I think some revelation just occurred, not just with Joe
the Plumber, but revelation occurred with Joe Biden's comment the other
night that he, telling his democrat, financial donors saying that, he said
Mark my word there will be economic, and, or INTERNATIONAL crisis he said i=
f
Barack Obama is elected, because he will be tested and he said there are
four or five scenarios that will result in an international crisis with thi=
s
untested presidential candidate in Barack Obama and first I think we need t=
o
thank Joe for the warning there, but Joe's words there, I think, can shed
some light to, in terms of the contrast you have in the tickets, John McCai=
n
is a tested leader, he has gone through great adversity, he has the scars t=
o
prove it, he has shown his true leadership, it hasn't just been all talk an=
d
Joe Biden's comments there about an untested, as he has said in the primary=
,
unprepared candidate to be president, I think was very telling.

GRIFFIN: Have you guys been briefed on any scenario like this?

PALIN: On the four or five scenarios?

GRIFFIN: Yes

PALIN: Well who knows what Joe Biden was talking about.  You know all you
have to do though is look back at Obama's foreign policy agenda and you can
assume what some of those scenarios may be.  As he considers sitting down
and talking to Ahmadinejad or Castro or Kim Jung Il, some of these dictator=
s
without preconditions being met, essentially validating some of what those
dictators have been engaged in that could be one of the scenarios that Joe
Biden is talking about is as a result of that that proclamation that he
would meet without preconditions being met first,  that could be a scenario
that results in a testing of our country and the 4 or 5 other scenarios tha=
t
he is talking about.  I don't know, I hope that Joe Biden will explain it.

GRIFFIN: Does Joe Biden get a pass?

PALIN: Ask- Drew you need to ask your colleagues and I guess your bosses or
whoever is, whoever is in charge of all this, why does Joe Biden get a pass
on such a thing.  Can you imagine if I would have said such a thing? No I
think we would have been hounded and held accountable.  What in the world
did you mean by that VP, Vice Presidential candidate.  Why would you say
that, mark my words this nation will undergo an international crisis if you
elect Barack Obama.  If I would have said that, you guys would have
clobbered me.

GRIFFIN: You're right.  [=85] You've talked about America, and certain part=
s
of America that are maybe more American than other parts of America?

PALIN: I don't want that misunderstood, you know and I go to these rallies
and we see the patriotism just shinning through these peoples faces and the
Vietnam veterans wearing their hats so proudly and they have tears in their
eyes as we sing our national anthem and it is so inspiring and I say this i=
s

MARK GREEN: I think it's constitutionally ignorant . . . in the Senate of
course, VP Cheney and his predecessors go sit in the Senate and preside and
only vote in case of a tie. Nobody in the Senate asks Cheney his opinion . =
.
.

CHRIS MATTHEWS: . . . I'm not going to say anything more than that's wrong.
The Vice President of the United States is only the presiding officer. If
you read the constitution, which the governor has not done, it simply says
that your only role is to break a tie and to preside. She said that she
could get in there and pass policy and good policies. She has the notion
that the Vice President of the United States as presiding officer or the
senate is somehow the majority leader . . .

characterized as low tax, high spending by making it high tax, higher
spending=85. It's going to kill job creation, which is going to obviously h=
urt
small businesses. you've got about half a million small businesses that
would be hit with that 250,000 dollar tax hike . . . I grew up in New Jerse=
y
so I know the real estate sticker shock of families that try to make ends
meet.

BILL BURTON: Real New Jersey?

PFOTENHAUER: Well, Bedminster, if you think that's real New Jersey or not
Bill, I don't know=85 if you want to talk about Senator McCain's plan you
should be honest . .  . Barack Obama is a redistributionist, he wants to
take money from some people, put it through the government spin cycle, hand
it back out to others and the problem is his policy will kill jobs. So what
good is your college tax credit if you don't have a job anymore Bill? What
good is your healthcare tax credit if you don't, if somebody doesn't have a
job, that's why our plan is designed to create jobs and keep taxes low.

*Mitchell Looks at What's Dragging McCain Down *(NBC 10/21/08 7:31pm)
ANDREA MITCHELL: Sarah Palin in Nevada today, attacking Barack Obama.

SARAH PALIN: I do want a president who is ready to lead on day one.

MITCHELL: Palin started as the spark plug to reignite John McCain's
campaign. Seven weeks later, her initial popular is fading. For the first
time her negatives now outweigh her positives by nine points, turning Palin
into a bigger drag on McCain than George Bush. Fully one third of those
questioned say Palin raises concerns about McCain's candidacy compared to
23% who worry McCain would continue George Bush's policies . . .

[ . . . ]

MITCHELL: The doubts about Palin make it harder for Republicans to exploit
Obama's biggest weakness in the poll. 23% say he is too inexperienced.
McCain hammered him on that over and over again today.

MCCAIN: We don't want a president who invites testing from the world . . .

MITCHELL: But McCain's attacks have occasionally been undercut by Palin.

[interview in which Palin delineates VP responsibilities]

MITCHELL: That's not what the constitution says . . .

*Pfotenhauer Calls Obama Econ Plan High Tax and Higher Spending *(MSNBC,
10/21/08 1:36pm)
ANDREA MITCHELL: What is your response to their jobs summit . . . what they
were doing today in Florida and their argument in favor of a stimulus
package?

NANCY PFOTENHAUER: Well Andrea, it just strikes me as very strange, that
Barack Obama believes that he can somehow change the current economic mess
by taking a policy that has been low taxes and high spending over the last
eight years, and somehow fix it by making it high tax and higher spending.
That's just, that math doesn't add up, so I hope he got some sense, but if
he had any, he would have been announcing today that he was not going to
move forward with taxes increases in a weak economy, and as you know, he's
increasing taxes on small businesses about half a million. That represents
about 55% of small business income, about 16 million workers, and he's also
a protectionist, so the two silver linings in our economy over the last
several months, even in this difficult time have been small business job
creation and exports, and his economic plan burdens both of those, and in m=
y
opinion, would stop any growth that we have a prayer of achieving.

MITCHELL: Let mess ask you about Congresswoman Michelle Bachman. On
"Hardball" Friday she raised a ruckus. Let me show you what she said and as=
k
you to respond.

MICHELLE BACHMAN [on video]: What I would say -- what I would say is that
the news media should do a penetrating expose and take a look. I wish they
would, I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of
people in congress and find out are they pro-America or anti-America? I
think people would love to see an expose like that.

MITCHELL: Now, after that suggestion, Nancy, the democratic opponent -- her
democratic opponent in her race in Minnesota, has managed to raise an
astounding $810,000 just in the last couple days, since this thing went
viral =96 the Cook Report, the respected Cook Report is now placing that ra=
ce,
which was likely republican, in the toss-up range. Is this one of the
biggest goofs that a republican incumbent has made in recent years?

PFOTENHAUER: Oh, I don't know, I think there's a fierce contest for who win=
s
that one, but speaking of goofs, and she brought up the word, I mean, I
think one of the most interesting and revealing comments =96

MITCHELL: You're going to go on to Joe Biden, but let me ask you to talk
about Bachman first, and then we'll go to Biden.  I'll give you Biden, if
you'll give me Bachman.

PFOTENHAUER: Okay, I really =96 I have no idea what was inside her head whe=
n
she was making those statements. I think each individual, whether they're
republican or democrat needs to be responsible for their statements and be
able to explain their beliefs to the American people. I just have no idea
precisely what she was calling for at the time.

MITCHELL: Would john McCain support that view?

PFOTENHAUER: I've never heard him use those words, Andrea, but if we can,
since we were talking about goofs or gaffes . . .

MITCHELL:  Okay, let's talk about Joe Biden, have at it.

PFOTENHAUER: Well, I think his statement yesterday was one of the most
revealing and interesting, not just of this presidential election, but
perhaps in modern history.  Because, if you played the entire clip, I'm jus=
t
going to gently chide you and beg you to play the entire clip, you will hea=
r
that Senator Biden=85

MITCHELL: You mean the one where he talks about Obama's steel spine,
perhaps?

PFOTENHAUER: No, the one where he talks about the fact that the election of
Obama would cause a generated attack by this nation's enemies, and that he
himself could think of four or five, and he's guaranteeing it would cause a
generated attack, that's very, very different from how the Obama campaign i=
s
trying to spin it right now. And the bottom line is it's dangerous to be
electing someone at this point in time who has, who has so little experienc=
e
and so little knowledge of foreign affairs, and Senator Obama's own running
mate knows it and made that statement not once, but twice.

MITCHELL:  We did play it earlier for Tom Daschle.

PFOTENHAUER: Did you play the whole thing? Tell me you played the whole
thing.

MITCHELL: I think we played the whole thing, as best I can tell we played
the whole thing. We've been playing it all day, we had it on Morning Joe,
believe me it's been getting a lot of airing on MSNBC. Let me ask you about
robocalls though. Now you've got Olympia Snowe, of Maine, joining Susan
Collins, joining Norm Coleman, some moderate senators, and at least two of
them are up for re-election, are calling on the campaign to stop the
robocalls, robocalls which are similar, sponsored by the same organization
that went after John McCain in the year 2000 in South Carolina. Is the
McCain campaign prepared to stop the robo-calls?

PFOTENHAUER: Well, you know, I don't know what the Obama campaign has said
about it, but I think Senator McCain, our approach is while they may not be
the most pleasant thing to listen on the other end, they convey vital
information, information that needs to be heard by voters before they make
the decision two weeks from today, and that it is a tried and true method o=
f
reaching people. And so, while I can understand while some people may not
enjoy getting them, I certainly think the do not call law or reg. that the
FDC put through, was probably the most popular in my lifetime that any
regulatory agency had ever done. These robo calls do play a role. That's wh=
y
I think you saw Governor Palin saying point blank that she would not reques=
t
them to be turned off.

MITCHELL: But at the same time she said she wouldn't use them. She wouldn't
have chosen them

PFOTENHAUER: She said no, I think what she said was, again, if you go
through the entire exchange =96

MITCHELL:  If she had her druthers.

PFOTENHAUER: That everybody wishes they lived in a world where it was easy
enough to reach people to have a genuine conversation along the lines of
what senator McCain was trying to accomplish with Senator Obama when he
asked him to do those town hall meetings, travel across the country, meet
with real Americans, have it be unscripted, give them the opportunity to as=
k
questions, ask follow ups. That was the kind of conversation that I think
our campaign wanted to have. Senator Obama chose not to engage in it, and
now we're kinda all trying to go reach as many voters as possible and shed =
a
light on Senator Obama's positions that are very far to the left. I was
listening to your earlier guest, and thought it was interesting, because,
Senator Obama, are you saying it's hard to win if you're far left or right?
Senator Obama is clearly far left, no matter how he tries to obfuscate it,
that's why he's got the most liberal voting record in the U.S. Senate.

MITCHELL: Okay. By the way, what Joe Biden said was "generated crisis" not
generated attack. Two different things we can leave it there, but believe m=
e
we have played that tape =96

PFOTENHAUER:  Do you play the part where it says that it won't be apparent
that he's done the right thing as well? That's important also, I think.

MITCHELL: Okay. Thanks for your editing advice.

about 55% of small business income, about 16 million workers, and he&#39;s =

to be electing someone at this point in time who has, who has so little
experience and so little knowledge of foreign affairs, and Senator Obama&#3=

are up for re-election, are calling on the campaign to stop the robocalls,
robocalls which are similar, sponsored by the same organization that went a=

John McCain in the year 2000 in South Carolina. Is the McCain campaign prep=

to stop the robo-calls?<br>&nbsp;<br>PFOTENHAUER: Well, you know, I don&#39=

campaign has said about it, but I think Senator McCain, our approach is whi=
le
they may not be the most pleasant thing to listen on the other end, they co=
nvey
vital information, information that needs to be heard by voters before they
make the decision two weeks from today, and that it is a tried and true met=
hod
of reaching people. And so, while I can understand while some people may no=
t
enjoy getting them, I certainly think the do not call law or reg. that the =

the lines of what senator McCain was trying to accomplish with Senator Obam=

meet with real Americans, have it be unscripted, give them the opportunity =

you saying it&#39;s hard to win if you&#39;re far left or right? Senator Ob=
ama is
clearly far left, no matter how he tries to obfuscate it, that&#39;s why he=
&#39;s got
the most liberal voting record in the U.S. Senate.<br>&nbsp;<br>MITCHELL: O=
kay. By the way, what Joe Biden said was
&quot;generated crisis&quot; not generated attack. Two different things we =
can
leave it there, but believe me we have played that tape =96<br>&nbsp;<br>PF=
OTENHAUER:<span>&nbsp; </span>Do
you play the part where it says that it won&#39;t be apparent that he&#39;s=
 done the
right thing as well? That&#39;s important also, I think.<br>&nbsp;<br>MITCH=
ELL: Okay. Thanks for your editing advice.<br>

when it comes to the right of Alaskan&#39;s to access public lands, unencum=

President Bush? Or is it his running mate, Gov. Palin?<br>&nbsp;<br>GEORGE =
