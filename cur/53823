Hi John-

This request in from our finance team for tomorrow's luncheon:

Dr. Asif Mahmood will be attending the luncheon tomorrow. He wanted to get
5min with you after the lunch-- could just be walking out the door. Would
that be OK with you?


*BIO:*

Dr. Asif Mahmood is a Pulmonologist located in the Greater Los Angeles
area, notably in the San Gabriel Valley.  Dr. Mahmood received his Medical
Degree from Sindh Medical College in Pakistan, and has been a practicing
physician for thirty years.  He is notably affiliated with a few prominent
hospitals in Southern California, including Huntington Memorial Hospital
and Methodist Hospital of Southern California.  Dr. Mahmood supported
Secretary Clinton in 2008 and will be hosting Secretary Clinton at his home
on September 27th in Bradbury, CA for a fundraiser.
