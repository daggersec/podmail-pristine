Hello Mr. Podesta,

I hope you are well. I am writing you to arrange a meeting between Hip Hop
icon and visionary Q-Tip and Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary
Clinton. He would like to meet with her to discuss ways he can be used as
bridge to the Hip Hop generation during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Q-Tip who is an ambassador member of Harry Belafonte=E2=80=99s Sankofa.org =
has long
been highly committed to issues of social justice. Q-Tip is devoted to
amplifying the voices of the disenfranchised in an effort to promote
justice, peace and equal rights for all. He is a big supporter of the work
Mrs. Clinton has done throughout her career and has also worked alongside
former president Bill Clinton at a 2003 DNC fundraiser. He even served as
DJ for Chelsea Clinton=E2=80=99s 25th birthday party in 2005. He=E2=80=99s =
had a lasting
track record with the Clinton=E2=80=99s throughout the years. In fact, he h=
ad hoped
to see Mrs. Clinton at his close friend Tory Burch=E2=80=99s fundraiser tom=
orrow in
The Hamptons. However, due to a prior commitment in Los Angeles, he will be
not be able to make it.

Q-Tip would love to have short one-on-one with Mrs. Clinton as soon as her
schedule permits. He will return to New York City on Monday.

Please let me know what can be arranged at your earliest convenience. Q-Tip
is passionate about helping Mrs. Clinton secure a victory in this
presidential race. Thank you in advance for your time.

All the best,

Betsy Jones
