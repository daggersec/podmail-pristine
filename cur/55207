Dear John:

As an Army Paratrooper, you won't often hear me lavish praise on a Navy guy=
, especially during football season. But when someone has sacrificed so muc=
h for our country and fought so forcefully for equality in our military, ex=
ceptions must be made.
=20
 [ https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/salsa/donation/common/public=
/?donate_page_KEY=3D8931 ]That's the case for Admiral Mike Mullen, former C=
hairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who we will honor next week in New Yo=
rk aboard the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum.
=20
All of us here at VoteVets.org are proud recognize the life and work of Adm=
iral Mullen, a true American hero who fought for his country =E2=80=93 and =
whose voice was critical to ending Don't Ask, Don't Tell, when of the most =
important civil rights victories in decades.
=20
We owe this tribute to Admiral Mullen. He has done so much for all of us =
=E2=80=93 please join us in thanking him on Tuesday, September 18.
=20
*You can make a donation, here, to support our event* [ https://org2.democr=
acyinaction.org/o/6676/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=3D89=
31 ]

Why is this so important?  Because Admiral Mullen's story begins as so many=
 of ours have. A love of country. A passion for service. And a commitment t=
o protecting freedom.=20
=20
He began his career as a midshipman and rose through the ranks to become th=
e most senior military advisor to two Presidents as Chairman of the Joint C=
hiefs of Staff. Along the way he became only the third officer in Navy hist=
ory to be appointed to four different four-star assignments.
=20
But history won't remember Admiral Mullen for his ranks. History will remem=
ber him for his achievements. He led our military with poise and character =
during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He played a key role in the missio=
n to eliminate Osama Bin Laden. And without him, we could not have repealed=
 the discriminatory "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" law.
=20
Along with Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, we will honor Admiral Mull=
en for his commitment to ending that law and for his entire life's work. We=
 will pay tribute to him and his wife Deborah Mullen, who has been an advoc=
ate and ally in her own right on so many of the issues and challenges affec=
ting military families.=20
=20
*I would encourage you to make a contribution - in any amount - to help sup=
port this event and send a strong message to the Admiral and his wife that =
VoteVets.org stands behind his work, supports his legacy, and appreciates h=
is lifetime of service.* [ https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/sals=
a/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=3D8931 ]

Your contribution will also support SLDN's ongoing work to ensure full equa=
lity in the military. We know that while the repeal of DADT was a monumenta=
l achievement, there is more work to be done to ensure equality of benefits=
 for all service members and their families.
=20
*Make a contribution today* [ https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6676/p/s=
alsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=3D8931 ] to support this histo=
ric event, this distinguished leader, and our collective march toward justi=
ce for all American service members.
