all meeting on October 15 and 16, 2015. The meeting coincided with two land=
mark events: the groundbreaking for the new Whitcomb Art Building&mdash;the=
 first new academic building on campus in 40 years; and a Homecoming weeken=
d that saw the Class of 1965 celebrate its 50th Reunion in record-breaking =
fashion: 65% of the alumni (the highest percentage ever) contributed to the=
ir class gift, which totaled $3,980,000, a record amount. In the glorious a=
utumn weather and colors of this year's Homecoming weekend, the enthusiasm =
for the College, its mission, and its forward momentum was remarkable.</p> =
                    <p>At the Board meeting, we welcomed new trustees Carol=
 Bovard Craig '89, Jan Koran '71, Helen Lin '94, John Sauter '63, and Susan=
 Haerr Zucker '78. We then reviewed progress on the strategic plan, <a styl=

Approved by trustees a year ago, Knox 2018 sets forward a set of goals and =
actions to strengthen Knox's position as one of the outstanding liberal art=
s colleges in the nation. The goals focus on:</p>                     <ol> =
                        <li>revising the academic program to make it optima=
lly responsive to current research, methodology, and modes of learning;</li=
>                         <li>building a deeper sense of community on campu=
s and among the alumni population; and</li>                         <li>str=
engthening the College's financial and physical resources that support its =
mission.</li>                     </ol>                     <p>During a fra=
nk and informative session, trustees discussed with the president and her c=
ouncil of vice presidents and high-level administrators the aspects of the =
plan that are on track, the ones that need more attention, and those that p=
resent challenges. The Board will continue to monitor Knox 2018 on an annua=
l basis to ensure its success.</p>                     <p>We were updated o=
n the progress of <a style=3D"text-decoration: none;font-weight:bold;color:=
#4F3276;" href=3D"http://knox.imodules.com/redirect.aspx?linkID=3D25505&eid=
=3D10797">Above &amp; Beyond</a>, a series of fundraising initiatives desig=
ned to address areas of strategic importance at the College. One of them is=
 an innovative project planned for Green Oaks. Architects from the firms Ch=
ristner and Bicknese + Hellmuth made a presentation to the trustees on a "l=
iving building" concept for a teaching, conference, and residential facilit=
y that would build upon Green Oaks' national reputation as a biological fie=
ld station. It's an ambitious plan, and one that complements the College's =
plans to renovate the Umbeck Science Mathematics Center to bring our facili=
ties for the study and research in the sciences into the 21st century.</p> =
                    <p><img alt=3D"New student arrive at Knox" src=3D"http:=

 style=3D"" align=3D"right" height=3D"190" hspace=3D"5" vspace=3D"5" width=
=3D"400">We also took a close look at admission and financial aid trends. A=
pplications reached a record high in 2015 and 417 new students began their =
studies this fall&mdash;about the same as the previous year. The College se=
eks to grow enrollment slightly, and the new communications and admission p=
ublications and strategies that are now in place are beginning to have a po=
sitive impact. On the other hand, the funding issues facing parents and stu=
dents who are interested in Knox continue to be challenging, thus moderatin=
g our ability to increase the number of students.</p>                     <=
p>As you know, these are significant times for liberal arts colleges, as th=
e demographics of college-age students change and funding sources decline o=
r shift. Mindful of this, President Amott and her colleagues led a presenta=
tion and discussion for the trustees on the steps that other independent co=
lleges have taken&mdash;both adaptive and innovative&mdash;to address the c=
hallenges. Knox has already taken a number of steps that have had a positiv=
e impact, and President Amott is considering others that the Board will rev=
iew over the course of the year. In addition to making the most effective a=
nd smart use of the College's resources&mdash;something Knox has done throu=
ghout its history&mdash;the administration and faculty will be exploring ne=
w revenue streams to augment the dominant revenue stream of student tuition=
.</p>                     <p>At dinner, we had the pleasure of learning mor=
e about recently tenured and promoted faculty members, who spoke to the boa=
rd. Over breakfast, trustees engaged in roundtable discussions with more th=
an 14 faculty members and administrators to learn more about various issues=
 and initiatives on campus.</p>                     <p>As the meeting concl=
uded, I was reminded of the high level of talent, experience, and commitmen=
t that our trustees possess. It's an honor to serve as the Board's chair an=
d to help Knox move forward with confidence, as it grows and develops under=
 President Amott's inspiring leadership.</p>                     <div><img =
