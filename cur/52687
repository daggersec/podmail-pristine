John --=20

As we face the fundraising deadline at midnight tonight, I want you to =
know what we are up against.

Less than 24 hours ago, the McCain campaign launched the latest and lowest =
in a series of misleading attack ads.

This Karl Rove-style ploy misleads people about Barack's energy plan and =
even mocks his ability to inspire voters and bring Americans back into the =
political process.

Watchdogs in the media are calling McCain's accusations "bogus," =
"desperate," "wrong," "misleading," "ugly," "offensive," "reckless," and =
"a nasty turn into the gutter."

Some of McCain's own supporters agree. One senior Republican strategist =
quoted by the Washington Post called the latest ad a "wild swing at Obama" =
that reflects his campaign's "increasing bitterness" and the lack of "any =
coherent strategy to elect McCain."

Even John Weaver, a strategist who worked for McCain's presidential =
campaign in 2000 and on his current campaign last year, called the ad =
"childish," adding that this negative strategy "diminishes John McCain" =
and "needs to stop."

But we will not let any attack stand. Barack himself responded quickly and =
forcefully, and within hours our campaign created a response ad to take =
their smear tactics head-on.

Make a donation of $5 or more now to get our response on the air and show =
the McCain campaign that there is a cost to this kind of negative =
politics:

https://donate.barackobama.com/midnight1

With the election less than 100 days away, media pundits and Washington =
insiders will be watching our fundraising numbers more closely than ever.

In the face of these new attacks, you can help demonstrate that a movement =
funded by grassroots supporters giving only what they can afford is ready =
to take on the Republican fundraising machine and its onslaught of =
negativity.

Your support will also give this campaign a crucial boost in momentum as =
we build our organization to compete in all 50 states.

There are only hours left to make an impact in July.

Watch the new ad and make a donation of $5 or more before the midnight =
deadline:

https://donate.barackobama.com/midnight1

Thanks, =20
