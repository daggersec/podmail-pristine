opportunity to test our skills of collaboration and resourcefulness. Spoile=

> In preparation for this move, casual labor and sustainability staff stock=
piled boxes from the cafeteria, computer labs, and the C-store. As offices =
began packing up for the move, they were directed to staging zones where th=
ey could obtain the necessary boxes for their transition. As the cascading =
move progressed, over 1500 mid-sized boxes were diverted temporarily from t=
he cardboard compactor. They were labeled with small, brightly colored tags=
 for aid of sorting and transport, then collected, re-labeled and reused se=
veral times over.
>=20
> Assuming a fraction of the used boxes would have been purchased specially=
 for the move, Knox saved over $3,000 and reduced its external environmenta=
l footprint by 2,300 lbs of CO2e emissions, 17,700 gallons of water, and 2,=
250 lbs of raw tree fiber.
>=20
>=20
> REUSE and RECOVERY
>=20
> Each office preparing for the move was provided with a waste-free moving =
guide, which listed all the materials they could set aside for recovery and=
 recycling. The unused office supplies from around the school were collecte=
d in the Office of Sustainability, to stock the new office supply share zon=
e you read about in last month=E2=80=99s newsletter. Campus-owned office fu=
rnishings were redistributed to other campus spaces through a cascade defin=
