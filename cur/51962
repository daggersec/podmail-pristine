After careful consideration for FFA presence at the DA Conference in April
and a meeting with our east coast donors I would like to make the following
proposal:

*We need to work with DA to get an invite letter out this week so approval
on this process by tommorrow noon is required.*

Letter out from Podesta and Begala to donors inviting them to attend the DA
meeting in CA end of April, and or NYC meeting in May (I do not want to wait
until June to communicate with the East Coast Donors)

Joint program with FFA and DA for 1/2 day on the 30th to present an update
on the Funds activity and progress in the progressive community.

Meeting in mid May- 1/2 day with a social activity (reception afterward) for
our NY Donors

We agree to encourage as many donors (especially West Coast to attend the DA
meeting) and we will also try to maximise attendance at the NY program.
(We should also consider inviting DA to help us co-host the NY event)

We will work with Marc Elias and DA to structure a compelling and legal
presentation of our efforts.

If anyone has concerns with pursuing this plan please let me know as soon as
possible.

Thank you
