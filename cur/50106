Celebrate forty years of the Clean Water Act today!

Dear Mary,

For forty years, Clean Water Action, our allies, and millions of Americans =
have taken action for clean water. Our best tool in the fight for a clean w=
ater future has been the landmark, Clean Water Act [ http://www.cleanwatera=
ction.org/feature/forty-years-clean-water-act ]. Today marks the fortieth a=
nniversary of the Clean Water Act =E2=80=93 and we're celebrating!

Celebrate with us =E2=80=93 Join us on Twitter [ http://twitter.com/cleanh2=
oaction ] to support the Clean Water Act and our clean water future. It's e=
asy, use the hashtag #CleanWaterAct and join thousands of other clean water=
 supporters! Here's a sample tweet:" For 40 years the #CleanWaterAct has pr=
otected America's waters and ensured that they are fishable, drinkable, and=
 swimmable. Thank you!" More details about the Twitter Party here [ http://=
blog.cleanwateraction.org/2012/10/17/tell-the-world-you-support-the-cleanwa=
teract ].

When Congress overwhelmingly passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, we set an =
incredibly ambitious goal: eliminate all water pollution. Before the Act, r=
ivers like the Cuyahoga caught fire, Lake Erie was declared "dead", untreat=
ed waste was routinely dumped in rivers and streams and wetlands were thoug=
ht to be useless swamps that needed to be drained for development or agricu=
lture. The Clean Water Act changed all of that. Our progress toward a clean=
 water future has been stunning =E2=80=93 but we're not there yet [ http://=
www.cleanwateraction.org/feature/clean-water-act-future ]. Learn more on "W=
e All Live Downstream" [ http://blog.cleanwateraction.org ]!

We have a responsibility to restore and protect our nation's greatest natur=
al resource =E2=80=93 water =E2=80=93 for current and future generations. T=
here is no better day to renew our commitment to a clean water future than =
today. It starts with you and me =E2=80=93 show your support for the Clean =
Water Act and help us build a clean water future!

For clean water,=20
