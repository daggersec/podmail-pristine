Good morning.....Pam Bailey, President and CEO  of the Grocery Manufactuers=
 of America (one of our clients) would like to come and visit you about GMO=
s. I asked Steve champlin my partner who does a lot of our work for GMA to =
give me a paragraph which you will find below.
Would you be willing to meet with her? She won't take a lot of your time an=
d I think you will find her well informed and thoughtful. Thanks....Mike
p.s. please let steve know if you would be willing to meet with her....I am=
 going to be out of pocket for a bit of a medical procedure for several day=
s....

There are two sets of relationship between GMO's and Global Warming.  The f=
irst is reducing global warming.  GMO's allow less plowing which reduces th=
e consumption of diesel fuel and the production of CO2.  There are other en=
vironmental gains.  The reduction of plowing also reduces erosion.  And GMO=
 crops allow for the use of less pesticides and herbicides.

The second set of relationshiops is reducing the impact of global warming. =
 The need for food will grow by 70% between now and 2050.  The growth comes=
 from the growth of population and also the growth of income.  More people =
will be able to eat a better diet.  This growth in the need for food comes =
as we have less water and less ariable land because of global warming.  GMO=
's allow farming with less water and GMO's increase productivity.  This is =
especially important for Africa where GMO crops allow higher production wit=
h less water.

The President has highlighted the role of GMO's, most recently in his remar=
ks at the APEC CEO Summit where he stated: "We look to China to approve bio=
technology advances that are critical to feeding a growing planet ..."
