keep me posted

currently have no Nov dates from WJC
2 foreign trips on the early horizon -
Oct 29-Nov 2 Israel (Lasry's plane)
Nov 7-12 Panama/Peru/Brazil

we only covered 6wks out on our WJC/CVC team call this week - when asked
Nov dates, they deferred saying w/foreign trips and thgiving, not much time.

to note, although we don't have CVC until Dec, she's doing an OTR stop by a
$er for Josh Gottheimer
Oct 27th, her Sidwell/best friend Nicki is the host.
