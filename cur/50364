Good morning, John.
You may remember Pete Stavrianos. He was the mastermind behind just about
all of my political victories in South Dakota. He has asked that I pass
this along to you.

Re:  Hillary & Sanders

Thought:

Suppose Hillary began effusively praising Sanders and his wing of the
party, saying openly that she has been changed in her views by them and has
perhaps misjudged the degree to which money in politics has corroded and
corrupted the process.

Assumptions:

- She needs at least some minimal support and enthusiasm from core Sanders
voters to supplement Trump fear as a driver of these voters to the polls in
the Fall.

- Her support from super delegates and minorities will defeat Sanders
regardless of her approach during the remainder of the primaries.

- Her currently chosen campaign as a keeper of the Obama flame who mildly
denigrates Sandersites as one issue voters will do nothing to begin the
process of winning real support from those voters (esp. youth).

How it might sound:

Only people intimately familiar with her campaign could decide how best to
launch an approach of this sort.  The following clumsily worded version of
what she might have said following Michigan were she employing this
approach is intended only to illustrate the opportunities (and pitfalls) of
the approach.  It is rushed and over the top, but I think does illustrate
the potential power of similar but better lines.

" I don't want to just congratulate my opponent on his victory tonight, I
want to thank him for the campaign he is running.   Mr Sanders is a teacher
and what he is teaching is something all of America needs to hear.  He is
right that we have given far too much power and influence to wealth in
America.  He is right that we have got to do something about it.  He won
because what he is saying is true, and it is important.  And I want to say
to him, and to my supporters tonight, that  all of us need to understand
the degree to which money and power have corrupted our democracy and pledge
ourselves to do something serious and tough about it.  Our campaigns,  Mr
Sanders campaign, and our own, must be the exact opposite of what we see on
the Republican side.  We must run serious, respectful campaigns on the
issues.  We must pledge ourselves above all else to make certain that
Americas promise of equal opportunity for all her citizens is one we will
respect above all else in office, then ask voters to select the person they
believe will be most able to turn that pledge into reality, and thus this
Fall to defeat the angry  intolerance and wealth worship that is taking
over the GOP.  etc. etc."

Pitfalls:

Just another phony Clinton tactic.  Why vote for her if she is just Bernie
lite?

Pros:

Respectful praise of opponent contrasts nicely with GOP.  Takes edge off
her inevitable defeat of Sanders with Sanders folk and begins process of
energizing them for Fall.
