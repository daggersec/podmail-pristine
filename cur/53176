Wonk Room work. Thought even though you would not want to share this on pape=
r - it could be an excellent talking point for tomorrow's donor meeting.=C2=
=A0 See below.=20



"Now McCain is calling for a new round of tax giveaways that are twice as ex=
pensive as the original Bush plan and nearly twice as regressive. His policy=
 will spend almost $2 trillion on tax breaks for corporations, including $1.=

in history.=C2=A0Meanwhile, he hasn=E2=80=99t proposed closing one single co=
rporate loophole.=C2=A0" =C2=A0=C2=A0=20
