Jim -- As we have discussed, I am very interested in working on the Obama T=
ransition Team. I worked in the transition office in 1992, as team members =
began going into the executive branch agencies, and I would welcome the opp=
ortunity to help the Obama team in its efforts this year.

I worked at FEMA for almost six years during the Clinton Administration, so=
 that would be my area of expertise and interest. Primarily, I served as th=
e FEMA Region 10 Director in Seattle. As additional duties, I set up and di=
rected the government's compensation program for victims of the government-=
caused fires in Los Alamos in 2000, and served for a brief period as the ag=
ency's Acting General Counsel.  I have continued to be involved in issues r=
elating to building safety and regulation, as well as disaster mitigation, =
in my five years as General Counsel with the International Code Council, wh=
ich develops the model codes that govern construction in most of the U.S.

I have attached a resume which outlines my background and experience in mor=
e detail.

Thanks for your assistance.

Best,

David
