John:

Hope this message finds you well.  Had hoped to see you at the Aspen
US-India Strategic Dialogue recently, though surprised to see you listed on
the program in light of how crazy your life must be right now (what else is
new?).  BTW perhaps you heard but the day before the dialogue Joe and Molly
Nye rolled over their car three times and Molly ended up in the hospital;
last I heard she was recovering well but thought you should know.

I thought a lot about you when the Paris climate agreement was concluded,
as so much of the important ground work, much not visible to the public,
was laid by you.  In particular I recall flying back from Beijing with you
after the major commitments you helped secure from Xi Jinping last
November, which created important momentum to gain other national
commitments.  I know there is a long row to hoe, but getting that level of
consensus in support  of these goals, with reporting, transparency, etc.,
is a big deal.  Congratulations!

There is one matter that I wanted to put on your radar for situational
awareness in light of your other responsibilities if possible.  I am
heading to Europe tonight through Tuesday, then away with family December
24-29, but otherwise in DC if you want to get together for coffee or
lunch.  If you are too busy for that these days then of course we can
connect by phone.  Let me know.

Warmest holiday wishes to you and yours!

Best,

Dan
