The 10th Annual Privacy & Data Security Symposium

Big Data: Privacy and Data Security Issues for Media and Communications Com=
panies

Wednesday, March 25, 2:00 ? 6:00 p.m. (EST)
The FCBA Privacy and Data Security Committee and the ABA Forum on Communica=
tions Law will hold the 10th Annual Privacy & Data Security Symposium on We=
dnesday, March 25 from 2:00 ? 6:00 p.m. (EST). This CLE will be held at Arn=
old & Porter LLP, 555 12th Street, NW, Washington, DC.

Last month's landmark net neutrality decision by the FCC to classify Intern=
et Service Providers (ISP) as common carriers will impact every ISP's colle=
ction, use, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable information (=
PII) and other related data. The Customer Proprietary Network Information (=
CPNI) requirements under Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934, as =
amended, will now apply to more entities. This is a very new development fo=
r ISPs and anyone doing business with ISPs, such as broadcast stations or o=
ther media/telecom companies that serve behavioral advertising, or online s=
ervice providers that are engaged by media and telecommunications companies=
 and their clients.

    How does the FCC's net neutrality decision impact Big Data companies or=
 providers, or the Big Data ecosystem?
    What changes in internal privacy practices and business operations will=
 be required for use of PII not previously regulated?
    Will the FCC's net neutrality decision impact behavioral advertising? C=
an ISPs continue to collect, use and/or disclose information about consumer=
 viewing, habits, search or transaction history? What precautions, if any, =
should be taken?
    How will the FCC's CPNI Rules govern ISPs?
    For ISPs and other media and communications companies' use of Big Data,=
 what is the new enforcement regime under the FCC and the FTC?
    Does Section 5 of the FTC Act still govern ISPs or will the FTC's commo=
n carrier exemption apply?

The FCBA has applied for 3.5 hours of MCLE credit from the VA and CA State =
Bars. Approval is pending.

Consumer Protections in the Age of Big Data

A panel of senior officials from various federal agencies, such as the FTC,=
 FCC, NTIA, and Congress will address the government?s concerns with the co=
llection, use and disclosure of aggregated personally identifiable informat=
ion about consumers, particularly by media and telecommunications companies=
, and given the FCC?s recent net neutrality decision to reclassify Internet=
 Service Providers (an integral part of the Big Data ecosystem) as common c=
arriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

h as the FCC?s CPNI and cable privacy rules, FTC Act Section 5, and the Whi=
te House Consumer Bill of Rights or whether new laws and regulations should=
 be adopted.  We will also discuss Congress?s legislative efforts regarding=
 privacy and data security, and we will explore the activities of each agen=
cy as well as interagency efforts to address the impact of Big Data on cons=
umer privacy.

Session II: Balancing Big Data Analysis
with Consumer Privacy in the Private Sector

While government agencies grapple with designing and implementing privacy a=
nd security regulations appropriate for an age of Big Data and unprecedente=
d interconnectivity, private entities must confront the challenges of navig=
ating a patchwork of national and subnational regulation, preparing for vas=
t (and increasingly likely) changes to federal cyber laws, and developing d=
efense and reaction procedures in the event of a hack or data breach.

Our second panel delves into issues confronted by private actors in media a=
nd communications ? the labyrinthine regulatory environment, the unforeseen=
 problems associated with Big Data collections and applications, and innova=
tive steps being taken in effort ensure safer, more secure operations.
