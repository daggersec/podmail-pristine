Said you'ld call her tomorrow and get the right team over there for a briefing. I reiterated one president at a time, but this is one area where it seems BO/Rahm want to be a little more forward leaning. (I didn't tell her that) We should lash up the hud team with this. I think they fdic have already briefed michael barr who has done cap's work on this. Let me know if you want to discuss.
