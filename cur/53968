John -- =20

Great news: This weekend's events were a huge success. OFA volunteers all =
over the country helped tens of thousands of voters in key districts speak =
out for reform.

Phones have been ringing off the hook in Capitol Hill offices for days, =
but with everything on the line and so little time left, we have to bring =
our voice to Congress through every possible channel.

So today, OFA supporters are taking the next step in the Final March for =
Reform: Writing to Congress. Using our online tool, it just takes a few =
minutes to write and send your own letter directly to your representative.

Right now, Congress is under attack from insurance lobbyists who are =
trying to drown us out, so we're aiming to flood Capitol Hill with letters =
to make sure our message breaks through.=20

Can you help? Get started here:

http://my.barackobama.com/DaySix6

In the days ahead, we'll keep you up-to-date on the latest news on health =
reform as it breaks -- so keep checking your email. But right now, please =
make sure supporters of reform in Congress continue to hear our thanks for =
their efforts -- and that everyone hears their constituents' overwhelming =
support for reform. Click here to write your letter:
