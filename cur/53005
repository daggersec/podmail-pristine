Mr. P,

Given the results from Tuesday, I thought your press conference presentatio=
n--words, tone, body language, teasing w reporters and occasional flashes o=
f your smile-- was right on target. What is not apparent to me is whether i=
t was like the proverbial duck--smoothly sailing on the surface while paddl=
ing like crazy below as you assess and strategize the way forward. I'm alwa=
ys available to you to discuss any and all matters if I can be helpful to y=
ou.=20

On china, I know you'll be in Beijng next week, so am sending a news report=
 about how Xi's official party on its visit to Tanzania loaded up their pla=
nes w poached ivory, likely w full knowledge of Kikwete's government.=20

Please raise this issue directly w XI, both because it is critical on the m=
erits but also because it's another way you can gain some leverage with the=
 Chinese. I'm happy to discuss this with the White House team.
