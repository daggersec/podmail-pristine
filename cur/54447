The one point all press make to me and are mildlly panicked about is
theie desire to be able to explain what is going to happen next on the
transiton as part of their election night stories.  I am guessing that
on or by election day, you two will l have worked out with the
campaign wihat if anything you want to background the press on.

In the meantime, I am bucking those requests to thr campaign.

Sound right?
