John --=20

What I find most impressive about organizing is what goes on
behind the scenes. The hours you put in knocking on doors,
calling your representatives, and having conversations with
your friends is what gets us to the finish line on so many
tough issues -- and frankly, it isn't celebrated enough.

So this fall, OFA is celebrating the nitty-gritty. They're
going back-to-basics and taking a moment to recognize the
importance of the fundamentals at their Organizing Summit in
Washington, D.C.

You could win a chance to meet with Barack while you're
there. Say you're ready to keep fighting for progress this
fall, and you'll be automatically entered into OFA's
contest:

https://my.barackobama.com/Organizing-Basics

Barack and I know how hard this work can be -- working late
nights is sort of a tradition in our house -- but it's
incredibly important, especially with some of the big ticket
items on Congress' to-do list this fall.

You should know, John: As long as folks keep taking
that next step for what they care about -- spreading the
word about equality for all, or demanding leadership on
climate change -- we can make some amazing progress
together.

Your accomplishments give future organizers something to
look up to, and I know Barack would love to meet you at the
summit this fall. Add your name to be automatically entered
for a chance to meet him:
