Hi Dad,

With a half day in Madrid, I would do a walking tour of the city and,
depending on his interests, either the Royal Palace or the Prado. Both are
fabulous; I'm not really into art so I enjoyed the Palace more but the Prad=
o
is probably Madrid's most famous sight and has a lot of beautiful and famou=
s
works. The Palace is in the old part of the city and has some stunning view=
s
of the surrounding area.

If he has enough time, I would see the Palace for an hour, then walk from
Plaza del Opera  (right near the Palace) up to Plaza del Sol.  Then I would
use Plaza del Sol as a base to walk to the Plaza Mayor and the Plaza de
Cibeles. The weather should be great this time of year. If he'd rather do
the Prado than the Palace, the Prado is right off of Plaza de Cibeles. It
all makes sense if you look at a map.

I would have either lunch or tapas in the Plaza Santa Ana (right off the
plaza del Sol), which has beautiful outdoor seating (the restaurants are
pretty much all the same - I would get a glass of Spanish red wine and a
bunch of traditional tapas like squid, octopus, jamon iberico, tortilla,
etc).

Hope this helps! Feel free to forward me any questions.

Nicole
