"I think our interests and his...align, especially on EPA stuff."
-=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Anonymous oil industry lobbyist on Rep. Fred Upton, Hous=
e Energy & Commerce Committee Chair

Dear John,

There's a new class of stridently anti-environment members of Congress --
taking their cues from Big Oil and the Tea Party and determined to undermin=
e public health. At the top of their agenda in the 112th Congress? Radicall=
y
undermine the EPA's efforts to =A0protect our families from deadly pollutio=
n, like mercury, arsenic, smog and carbon dioxide.

One of those members - Rep. Fred Upton - is the new chair of the House Ener=
gy and Commerce Committee. Upton - who was recently spotted sitting in the =
front row at an oil industry sponsored event - is now leading the charge to=
 give corporate polluters free reign to pollute the air we breathe.

Unfortunately, Upton isn't alone. This past November, over 30 anti-environm=
ent Tea Partiers won their races, with stridently
anti-environment leaders like Sarah Palin leading the charge.

And now, backed by Big Oil, inspired by Palin, and promoted by Fox News,
these anti-environment members are out to cripple the EPA, weaken laws that
protect us from toxic chemicals, and remove public health standards.

LCV is ready to expose these politicians' radical agenda and protect our co=
untry's most essential environmental and public health laws. We have the
strategy and the expertise we need to win. Now, we need you to help us reac=
h our 2011 member goal by January 31 so we have the resources ready to figh=
t back.

Renew your LCV membership today.
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DNXDNUWN6q-1Qy6-StmuJiA..

When you renew your LCV membership today, you stand with the group that's b=
een winning and defending environmental progress for decades. And you help =
make sure we have the resources we need in the weeks and months ahead to fi=
ght Sarah Palin's Tea Party agenda. With your support, we'll be
able to:

*  Mobilize environmental activists to contact their elected officials via =
phone, e-mail and in-person prior to key votes
*  Publish the National Environmental Scorecard, the most respected yardsti=
ck for measuring political leaders' environmental records and holding them =
accountable
*  Utilize new online organizing tactics, including various social media to=
ols, to recruit and engage a new generation of clean energy advocates.
*  Educate voters about the threats to landmark health and environmental pr=
otections and the benefits of creating a clean energy economy to build pres=
sure for progress in the states, and from there to the national level
*  Coordinate with our state LCV partners and other key allies to build a b=
road and diverse network of supporters in key states

We need your help when we go up against one of the most anti-environment Co=
ngresses in years.

LCV will publicize their dirty tactics and outrageous lies, and impose a po=
litical price on those lawmakers who put profits before people. But our
success - and the future of our planet - depends on your immediate support.

Renew your commitment to LCV and the environment by making a membership gif=
t by January 31.

Thank you for renewing your support at this critical moment.

Sincerely,
