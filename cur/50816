Hi, John,
Thanks so much for taking the time to chat about Brian. The story's mostly
set, but we're looking for one more anecdote that shows him in action on
climate change. Could you think of a moment when you recall him being in
the room, doing something specific on climate, as the plans were being made
to pass on the reins to him? Any example you could think of would be
welcome!
thanks so much,
Coral
