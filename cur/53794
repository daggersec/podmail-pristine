John,

I am sure you have seen what happened to our friends at Zaman:
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35730041 Press freedom is now =
entirely
on life support over 1,800 people have been charged with =93insulting =
the
president,=94 including celebrities, journalists, and even =
schoolchildren.

We receive a lot of requests from journalists (over 1,000 have lost =
their
jobs by now) and public intellectuals to spend 3-6 months here at CAP to =
do
research, help inform our Turkey policy conversations, and start =
breathing
again away from the political pressure-cooker over there.

The arrest and three-month pre-trial detention of Turkish journalists =
Can
D=FCndar and Erdem G=FCl =96 accused of espionage and treason for =
publishing
pictures showing Turkish intelligence agency trucks attempting to =
smuggle
weapons into Syria =96 is perhaps the highest-profile recent case. After =
their
release, D=FCndar and G=FCl were giving an interview to a pro-Kurdish =
then the
broadcasting platform was abruptly taken off the air by the Turkish
Satellite Communication Company (Turksat). Other media outlets were also
shut down last this week, including the dailies Bug=FCn and Millet and =
the TV
stations Bug=FCn TV and Kanalt=FCrk.=20

All in all, it=92s a devastating situation. We are trying to offer our
journalist friends in Turkey the option to spend some time over here in
Washington, away from the chaos. And to make a difference in the life of
good and brave people fighting to protect democracy.=20

Your brother has been helpful coming up with ideas and also mentioned =
that
you know David Cohen at Comcast/NBC. I know how busy you are=97but would =
you
be willing to put us in contact with him so we can pitch the fellowship
idea?

M.
