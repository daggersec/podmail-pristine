SEIU has 1500 fast food organizers in Detroit over the weekend doing
training for the $15/hour organizing campaign. They have asked whether you
would be willing to call or video in for 5-10 minutes to rev up the troops.
We are very good with them right now so this is being offered as a way to
give their gang a way to get jazzed up and step on Bernie a little bit.
Given Jake's wedding, probably the only feasible opportunity is to do a
call, not a video, late Sunday morning and serve up a bit of red meat
solidarity. This is NOT about minimum wage, but rather organizing for
living wages. We all think it's worth doing, if it doesn't screw up your
Sunday too much. If there is a better time over the weekend, we could see
if that works for them.

On the labor front, O'Malley and to a lesser extent Sanders are calling
through union Presidents. We are in good shape there, but there are
probably several union presidents you should call, particularly those that
helped a lot in 08. Nicki is putting together a tiered priority list of 5
or 6.
