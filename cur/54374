> Dear Professors Leon and Podesta:
>=20
> My proposed paper topic examines claims of executive privilege with regard=
 to the testimony of executive branch officials before Congress.
>=20
> The case that prompted my interest in this topic is Sara Taylor's testimon=
y during the investigation into the U.S. Attorney firings.  My understanding=
 is that she took a unique approach in choosing to testify while also having=
 her attorney present and refusing to answer a broad range of questions on t=
he basis of President Bush's claim of executive privilege.
>=20
> My plan is to compare Taylor's case with the more typical claim of executi=
ve privilege case where the official simply refuses to testify and is held i=
n contempt, as happened to Harriet Miers in the same investigation.
>=20
> Through this comparative analysis I hope to get at some of the underlying q=
uestions about when executive branch officials can claim executive privilege=
 to prevent them testifying, which officials can claim this privilege, and t=
he mechanics of how this is done in practice.
>=20
> The ultimate conclusion may be to recommend, from a policy perspective, wh=
ether the Taylor approach of providing partial testimony is preferable to th=
e Miers approach of refusing to testify at all.
>=20
> Regards,
