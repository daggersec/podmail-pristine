John --

There's one simple thing you can do from now until November
6th to help shape the outcome of this election: Get as many
voters to the polls as possible.

To make sure you and folks from the District of Columbia
are ready to play a big role in the last few weeks, we're
holding a get-out-the-vote rally and training session on
Wednesday, October 17th. We'll be joined by a special=20
guest who will talk about our GOTV strategy in Virginia,=20
and get us fired up to help re-elect President Obama and=20
other Democrats.

Can you make it to the rally on Wednesday?

http://my.barackobama.com/GOTV-Rally-in-DC

Here are the details:

    What: GOTV rally and training

    Where: Sixth and I Historic Synagogue
    600 I Street NW
    Washington, DC 20001

    When: Wednesday, October 17th
    7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.

RSVP here:

http://my.barackobama.com/GOTV-Rally-in-DC

The heart of getting out the vote is connecting with
voters, inspiring them to cast their ballots, and giving
them the information and support they need to make that
possible.

Really, what could be more democratic?

That's why it's going to be our focus for the next 23 days
-- until the last ballots are cast both here in the
District and in Virginia. It's going to take all of us working=20
together to get it done -- and that means you, too.

On Wednesday night, you'll get the inside scoop on the
campaign's plan to get out the vote in Virginia and learn
how to effectively reach out to voters who need to hear
from us. Bring your friends, connect with your neighbors,
and step up to make a difference in the few weeks we have
left.=20

Make your mark on this election. Come out to the training
in D.C. and get ready for the final stage of this fight:

Hope you can make it,

Kouri

District of Columbia Director
