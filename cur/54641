Six Reasons Why the 2012 Election Will Be Considered Historic
=20
       Tuesday=92s election was important for many reasons.  Its outcome wi=
ll certainly benefit millions and millions of people =96 both in the United=
 States and around the world.  And President Obama=92s campaign will be rem=
embered as one of the best-run political efforts in the history of American=
 politics.
=20
      But beyond the many important short and mid-term consequences, I beli=
eve it will likely be remembered as an inflection point in American politic=
al history.  Here are six reasons why:
=20
     1). This election was truly a battle for the soul of America.  It pres=
ented Americans with the clearest choice in my lifetime between traditional=
 progressive American values =96 a vision of a society where we are all in =
this together on the one hand =96 and a vision of a society in which everyo=
ne looks out first and foremost for himself alone on the other.
=20
     Do we have each other=92s back?  Are we our brothers and sister=92s ke=
epers?  Do we refuse to leave anyone behind?  When we give everyone an oppo=
rtunity to succeed does that make all of us more successful =96 or is life =
and society a zero sum game where one person=92s success can only be purcha=
sed as the expense of another?
=20
      Tuesday=92s election framed up the question of whether we believe all=
 of those values we are taught in Sunday School, or whether we believe that=
 47%  of Americans have to be considered victims who cannot be convinced to=
 take responsibility for their lives?
=20
     Mitt Romney offered America an opportunity to choose values and leader=
s that were committed to the radical individualism espoused by his running-=
mate, Ayn Rand disciple Paul Ryan.  America said no.
=20
     Instead, Americans chose to move forward in our over 200 year long que=
st to create a society where everyone has a fair shot, pays their fair shar=
e and plays by the same rules.
=20
     2). The right wing viewed this election as a critical opportunity to d=
elegitimize progressive economic policies, return to the trickle down econo=
mics that they put in place during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, and=
 abandon the social contract implicit in the New Deal. They failed.
=20
     Just four years ago, trickle down economics suffered a devastating fai=
lure.  After eight years of promising that tax cuts for the wealthy and der=
egulating financial markets would bring economic growth and prosperity for =
everyone, the financial system collapsed and the Bush Administration chalke=
d up the worst record producing private sector jobs in 60 years =96 zero ne=
t private sector jobs over his entire term.
=20
    =20
     Obama will now have the opportunity to demonstrate palpably that progr=
essive economic policies are far superior to the trickle down theories that=
 so recently wrecked the economy.
=20
       The Great Recession was not just a run of the mill business cycle do=
wnturn.  Economies take years to recover from recessions that result from c=
atastrophic financial market meltdowns.=20
=20
      Obama=92s policies, not only prevented a slide into a second Great De=
pression, they also resulted in a gradual sustained recovery -- 32 months o=
f private sector job growth.  But it=92s been a long slog. =20
=20
     Now, unless the Republican leaders who still control the House precipi=
tate another impasse like the debt-ceiling crisis last year =96 the recover=
y will almost certainly accelerate.
=20
      The odds are good that the economic narrative that ultimately won the=
 day in this election will provide future electorates with indisputable pro=
of of the superiority of progressive economic policies by 2012 and 2016.=20
=20
      One of the most painful and misleading political consequences of a Ro=
mney election would have been hearing the pundits go on about the =93Romney=
 Miracle=94 as the economy continued to improve in the next two years as a =
result of the foundation laid by President Obama.
=20
     Now that won=92t happen =96 just the opposite.=20
=20
     In fact, the economic choice facing the country was even more extreme =
than whether or not to return to "trickle-down" economics. In many respects=
 the election became a referendum on the entire progressive political proje=
ct.  The Romney- Ryan budget was a frontal assault on the social contract i=
mplicit in the New Deal. In practice, the voters rejected this proposal.
=20
3). America will implement ObamaCare.
=20
      The major reason why the Republicans were able to use ObamaCare as an=
 election cudgel in 2010 =96 and to a more limited degree this year =96 was=
 that it had not yet been fully implemented.
=20
      As soon as it is fully up and running, support for ObamaCare will sky=
rocket =96 the same way it did in Massachusetts.  The reason is simple.  Ob=
amaCare will guarantee that most Americans have access to health insurance =
regardless of pre-existing conditions, at an affordable price. Once it is i=
mplemented, voters will not look kindly on a candidate who wants to take it=
 away.
=20
      By 2014 ObamaCare will be revered as a great accomplishment and Repub=
lican opposition will be viewed with the same approbation as the GOP=92s or=
iginal opposition to Medicare.
=20
4). This election will go down as the final chapter in the Right Wing=92s =
=93culture war=94.  They lost.
=20
     The Right made a desperate last ditch attempt to turn the tide in the =
=93culture war=94 =96 on equality for gays and lesbians, on the right of wo=
men to control their own bodies, on women=92s equal status in America=92s w=
ork places and society at large.
=20
     They failed. Their positions on rape, contraception and abortion cost =
them dearly among women.   In referenda this fall, the forces favoring marr=
iage equality won in four out of four states.
=20
      In the past, the Republicans used the issues of gay rights and reprod=
uctive choice as =93wedge issues=94 to divide the Democratic base.  Today t=
hose issues divide the potential Republican base.  It must have been shocki=
ng for some Republicans to see video banners saying =93Marriage Equality=94=
 and =93Abortion Rights=94 displayed across the stage at the Democratic Con=
vention.
=20
      The outcome of this election demonstrated that as the millennial gene=
ration grows in number in the electorate, it will most likely be impossible=
 for any candidate to win the Presidency who wants to take American social =
policy back to the 1950=92s. =20
=20
     5). Tuesday=92s election was a clear rejection of Romney=92s call to r=
eturn to a Neo-Con lead foreign policy of go-it-alone recklessness and blus=
ter.
=20
     For the next four years, Romney Advisor -- former Iraq War spokesman D=
an Senor =96 and other Neo-Cons won=92t be shaping American foreign policy.=
  Instead the Obama Administration will have another term to build the kind=
 of strong, self-confident, collaborative approach to the world that has so=
 massively improved America=92s standing among our fellow human beings.
=20
    6). This election made it clear that if the Republican Party continues =
its war on minorities, it is destined for political irrelevancy.
=20
     It is no longer possible to be elected President of the United States =
by depending entirely on the white vote. Forty five percent of Barack Obama=
=92s votes came from minorities =96 and especially African Americans and Hi=
spanics.
=20
     The white share of the vote dropped from 74% in 2008 to 72% this year.=
  In Presidential politics, demographics are destiny.
=20
      It turned out that African American voters were every bit as enthusia=
stic about re-electing President Obama as they were about electing him in t=
he first place.  He carried African American voters 96% to 4% -- and they t=
urned out at the same levels they had in 2008.
=20
      And Obama won Hispanic voters by 44% -- 72% Obama to 28% Romney.   Cl=
early the Hispanic vote cost Romney the states of Colorado and Nevada -- an=
d in all likelihood Florida. And if Republicans continue to demonize immigr=
ants in general and Hispanics in particular =96 Texas will be next.  That w=
ould make it statistically impossible for a Republican to take the White Ho=
use any time in the near future.
=20
      The GOP=92s problem with Hispanics goes well beyond its opposition to=
 immigration reform. Republicans like to delude themselves that many Hispan=
ics are =93conservative=94.  While many are very religious and have strong =
commitments to family, the polling shows that Hispanic voters believe in a =
society where everyone has each other=92s back =96 a society like a family =
-- where government plays an integral role.
=20
      This Election demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that if the G=
OP=92s attitude and openness to minorities doesn=92t change, then it will b=
ecome increasingly isolated from the diverse mainstream of Americans societ=
y.
=20
      As the President said in his victory speech, America is exceptional p=
recisely because we have created a diverse nation where people of every bac=
kground and religion and culture can live together in a tolerant, prosperou=
s society.  That=92s what makes us the shining city on the hill =96 the exa=
mple for the rest of the world.
=20
      Most Americans =96 and certainly the Millennial Generation =96 get th=
at.   If the Republican Party fails to get it as well, it will cease to be =
a major contender for national leadership.
