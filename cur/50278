I have run across a rather interesting document which outlines in detail th=
e principal current objectives of the House Benghazi Committee, and was won=
dering if you might have a minute or two to discuss this. If you are anywhe=
re near 1333 H in next day or two I might even show the document to you (I'=
m out on Thursday, however) though I am reluctant to hand out copies at thi=
s stage. It is a document which raises some questions about the bona fides =
of the committee's investigation, rather than about anything specific a cer=
tain former SecState might have done. If this is something that you would n=
ot want to get involved in, if you had any alternative ideas as to who I ou=
ght to speak to I would welcome them. Hope all is well etc. All best & rega=
