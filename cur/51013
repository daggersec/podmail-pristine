John,
I spent part of this weekend at a political conference in British Columbia =
with Leo Gerard.  As the HRC policy teams are starting to convene in earnes=
t, I'm forwarding to you his request to include Michael Wessel on the trade=
 advisory group.   See his message below.
(Leo, btw, is really worried about Trump and his members; what Trump is say=
ing about manufacturing jobs, trade and making America great resonates with=
 them.)

Hope you are well -- things are looking good, but lots of work ahead!
JMG

Governor -



 Following up on my recommendation that Hillary ask Michael Wessel to chair=
 or co--chair her international trade and economics advisory group.



    He was an advisor to her in 2008, along with others of course.   Roger =
Altman including Michael in several meetings on trade, economics and jobs d=
irectly with Hillary.   He's been working on these issues for almost 40 yea=
rs -- working for more than 20 years with Dick Gephardt as his top policy a=
dvisor and was national issues director in his '88 run and senior advisor i=
n '04.   After Dick dropped out, Kerry/Edwards named him as the co-chair of=
 their international trade advisory group.



  He's been talking to a number of Hillary's people.   He's got my trust, a=
nd that of many in the union/progressive community for all his work.   Sinc=
e 2001, he's also been a Commissioner on the US-China Economic & Security R=
eview Commission, a Congressional advisory group which Nancy Pelosi appoint=
ed him to.



  Hillary needs to show that she really understands what working people hav=
e been going through and the threats that are facing manufacturing.   Micha=
el has worked those issues his entire life.
