2 cents: I fully admit that there is likely a better way to do it, and
certainly my intent was not to mix the two or to go full Sanders and imply
an equivalency or a linkage. BUT I do think that, timing this for the
opening of the conference, for a more international audience in the FT, it
is worth some kind of acknowledgement. As leaders give speeches--certainly
POTUS and Hollande, but I would assume others as well--I strongly suspect
they will talk about what happened two weeks ago and why it is important
for the talks to go on as planned. If the COP was in London, there'd be no
need--but we're back in Paris.

But can certainly make this 100 percent climate if that is the consensus.
