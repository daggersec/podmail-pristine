John --

As we're organizing the last dinner with supporters on my last=20
campaign, our kind of politics is running up against a very cynical=20
calculation:

That a few billionaires writing $10 million checks are enough=20
to overpower the voices of millions of Americans.

That's why I want to meet you for dinner.

Donate $5 or whatever you can to our people-powered campaign,=20
and be automatically entered to join me -- hotel and airfare covered=20
for you and a guest:

https://donate.barackobama.com/Dinner

Overnight, we aren't going to change the rules that allow outside=20
groups to spend hundreds of millions of dollars attacking me on=20
the airwaves.

So we have to stay on the case every day.

Last week we learned that more than 1.1 million donors in August=20
alone -- out of more than 3 million people like you supporting this =
effort=20
-- had outraised Mitt Romney and the Republicans for the first time since =
April.

If we keep doing this our way, I guarantee you there'll be no stopping=20
us.

Donate $5 or whatever you can today and you'll be automatically=20
entered to be at the table:

https://donate.barackobama.com/Dinner

Thanks,

Barack

P.S. -- If you're planning on donating to this campaign at some point =
in=20
the future, don't wait. Your grassroots donation means more today =
because=20
it can be put to work right now, building the organization it will take=20
to win. Exactly 47 days to go:

https://donate.barackobama.com/47-Days2
















No purchase, payment, or contribution necessary to enter or win. =
Contributing will not improve chances of winning. Void where prohibited. =
Entries must be received by September 25, 2012. You may enter by =
contributing to Obama for America here -- =
https://donate.barackobama.com/DWB-Disclaimer-Entry -- by signing up for =
Quick Donate here -- http://my.barackobama.com/DWB-Disclaimer-QD -- or =
click here -- http://my.barackobama.com/DWB-Disclaimer-Alt -- to enter =
without contributing or signing up for Quick Donate. Three winners will =
each receive the following prize package: round-trip tickets for winner =
and a guest from within the fifty U.S. States, DC, or Puerto Rico to a =
destination to be determined by the Sponsor; hotel accommodations for =
winner and a guest; and dinner for winner and a guest with President Obama =
on a date to be determined by the Sponsor (approximate retail value of all =
prizes $4,800). Odds of winning depend on number of entries received. =
Promotion open only to U.S. citizens, or lawful permanent U.S. residents =
who are legal residents of 50 United States, District of Columbia and =
Puerto Rico and 18 or older (or age of majority under applicable law). =
Promotion subject to Official Rules -- =
http://my.barackobama.com/DWB-Disclaimer-Rules -- and additional =
restrictions on eligibility. Sponsor: Obama for America, 130 E. Randolph =
St., Chicago, IL 60601.
