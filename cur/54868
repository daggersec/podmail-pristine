Have we given any thought to keeping them in general election battleground
and money center states. This is from my super volunteer friend in Chicago.

Morning John and Milia!

Big day Saturday!

We are all working hard to hit the house party quota for the 13th!

We love the field organizers and truly hope you keep them in their states!
It's almost consensus of serious concerns of what pulling them out would do
to the efforts!

I'm sure we can help find housing for them long term!
