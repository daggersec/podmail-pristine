Thank you for your prompt reply.=C2=A0
I feel so strongly about Texas that I'm going to head there right after New=
 Hampshire to help!=C2=A0
If I could be so bold as to recommend a Steven Rivas - a 2008 Hillary deleg=
ate - has done work for Department of Homeland Security, knows van and orga=
nizing and key folks.=C2=A0
He's in Austin. (don't set up state headquarters there because Austin is so=
 ridiculously over priced and expensive!)=C2=A0
His contact is 210-310-4224 steven@rivasgroup.com
Thank you and I hope I wasn't a bother or too forward on this.

Thank you John for taking the time to write this. You make some solid point=
s. Texas is a very important state for us and we have got to get it right.=
=C2=A0
A couple of updates:We will have our Regional Director, Jessica Mejia, on t=
he ground on Jan 15 through the primary and an organizer to follow.=C2=A0 W=
e agree, we can't do TX with just one person.=C2=A0
We finished out that year doing a number of organizing events as she travel=
ed to March states as we did on her last TX trip.=C2=A0 But, the schedule i=
s very difficult and will get worse since she needs to be in IA and NH as m=
uch as possible. But, we hear you.
The comments about office, surrogates, and events will improve with folks o=
n the ground, but it sounds like we have some catching up to do.=C2=A0 Than=
k you for the Intel.
Again, we really do appreciate all that you are doing, including taking=C2=
=A0the time to share these suggestions.
Talk to you soon and Happy New Year,Amanda

Dear Amanda and John,=C2=A0First off, thank you for the holiday card!=C2=A0=
 That was a lovely surprise to come home to and made my day!=C2=A0Wishing u=
s all a year of great things in 2016!=C2=A0A tremendous amount of hard work=
 by Hillary's team and her grassroots is paying off and it=E2=80=99s wonder=
ful to see that reflected in donations, recent polling, online and in the m=
edia.=C2=A0But there are three areas, in my opinion, I would like to bring =
your attention to.=C2=A0#1 =C2=A0 TEXAS.=C2=A0 I spent a lot of time there =
in previous elections.=C2=A0 You won't find a more dedicated and experience=
d group of Hillary supporters than in Texas. Over the summer they had event=
s, booths and did all kinds of great work but everything has stalled there =
as a result of having no access to VAN and no organizer/s.=C2=A0 Bernie's c=
ampaign has hired some very well known organizers, has offices, done public=
 free events and has been hitting it very hard.=C2=A0 Houston is particular=
ly problematic. We need to get organizers hired and VAN up and going!=C2=A0=
 They were also told no phone banking.=C2=A0 Is it possible to have at a mi=
nimum,=C2=A0a VPB link for Texas going so our volunteers/grassroots can sta=
rt up phone banks?=C2=A0 That would be a huge help!=C2=A0 Folks were told t=
hat there would be staff last year, VAN would be available last year, etc e=
tc but still nothing. TEXAS is the largest delegate reward on super Tuesday=
 and they start early voting while the first four are voting.=C2=A0 Much of=
 the Democratic party activists/party leaders/county chairs there, are supp=
orting Bernie and they have a head start on us, not to mention a huge advan=
tage!=C2=A0 In Houston alone, the party chair has invited Bernie people to =
speak at events, use the party office, begged Bernie to come to Houston whe=
n he found out they were going to Dallas, but hasn=E2=80=99t let the Hillar=
y people have the same advantages.=C2=A0 25% of Dem votes come from Houston=
 alone.=C2=A0 With Bernie hiring paid staff in later states and not droppin=
g the DNC lawsuit, it becomes all the more important for us to consider tha=
t this might be a long primary and that every delegate will matter.=C2=A0 T=
he DEMS/liberals of Texas were mighty burned after 2014 and that situation =
coupled with Texas=E2=80=99 innate outsider personality, makes Texas ripe f=
or Bernie.=C2=A0 The fundraiser only events are upsetting and discouraging =
folks as well, big time.=C2=A0 It=E2=80=99s even becoming a problem for the=
 fundraisers because every time they post that an event is happening, they =
are immediately met with complaints that regular people can=E2=80=99t affor=
d that.=C2=A0 The appearance of it has even turned off some Hillary support=
ers, not to mention how it must look to those on the fence, or undecideds.=
=C2=A0 Texas is the size of 5 states and one organizer will not be enough, =
although even one would be appreciated at this point. They are less than a =
month and a half away from early voting.=C2=A0 Anyway things can be expedit=
ed? We have super volunteers with a year of VAN experience, on the ground c=
ampaign experience, and organizing experience, ready to go! We need a green=
 light and fuel! President Bill Clinton is very popular, could he be sent?=
=C2=A0 To do some free townhall/rallies. =C2=A0 I can't stress enough impor=
tance of investing in TEXAS.=C2=A0=C2=A0#2 =C2=A0 =C2=A0Small Dollar Donati=
ons: Kim Frederick recruited me finally to be a Hill-Raiser. It would be gr=
eat if we could build up/encourage low dollar donations by using incentive'=
s like you do for the Hill-Raisers.=C2=A0 Take the $1 a day, $3 a day, or $=
5 a day pledge, provide a donation link with those options (that can be tie=
d to a Hillraiser too) and having a recurring button that automatically doe=
s that for the donor who is taking the pledge.=C2=A0 Upon completing the pl=
edge, each level, $1, $3, $5, gets a special button :) =C2=A0That really wo=
uld help drive up the number of low dollar donations and reward folks for p=
articipating!=C2=A0 Maybe provide incentives to Hill-Raisers who get a cert=
ain percentage of their donations from $100 or less? Also, we need an army =
of surrogates out there for $25-$100 events.=C2=A0 I'm seeing surrogate eve=
nts that are wayyyy too high and not diverse at all.=C2=A0 Lena Dunham at $=
150 - $1000?=C2=A0 That excludes our target demographic for her completely!=
=C2=A0 And some areas aren=E2=80=99t seeing any surrogate events at all.=C2=
=A0=C2=A0#3 =C2=A0 Something Bernie hasn't talked about at all is the Creat=
ive Class.=C2=A0 Yes free college or debt free college is great. But what a=
bout a job afterward?=C2=A0 So many students in the Arts (of all kinds) lea=
ve college with few good job opportunities.=C2=A0 What about a CREATIVE CLA=
SS JOBS BILL? I think Hillary could hit that up and tie it to the UNIQUELY =
AMERICAN quality of creativity and ingenuity that cannot be OUTSOURCED. :) =
=C2=A0This would appeal to youth of all kinds.=C2=A0=C2=A0Just some thought=
s...but please please don't let TEXAS slip by! =C2=A0=C2=A0Thank you,=C2=A0=

#1 &nbsp; TEXAS.&nbsp; I spent a lot of time there in previous elections.&n=
bsp; You won't find a more dedicated and experienced group of Hillary suppo=
rters than in Texas. Over the summer they had events, booths and did all ki=
nds of great work but everything has stalled there as a result of having no=
 access to VAN and no organizer/s.&nbsp; Bernie's campaign has hired some v=
ery well known organizers, has offices, done public free events and has bee=
n hitting it very hard.&nbsp; Houston is particularly problematic. We need =
to get organizers hired and VAN up and going!&nbsp; They were also told no =
phone banking.&nbsp; Is it possible to have at a minimum,&nbsp;a VPB link f=
or Texas going so our volunteers/grassroots can start up phone banks?&nbsp;=
 That would be a huge help!&nbsp; Folks were told that there would be staff=
 last year, VAN would be available last year, etc etc but still nothing. TE=
XAS is the largest delegate reward on super Tuesday and they start early vo=
ting while the first four are voting.&nbsp; Much of the Democratic party ac=
tivists/party leaders/county chairs there, are supporting Bernie and they h=
ave a head start on us, not to mention a huge advantage!&nbsp; In Houston a=
lone, the party chair has invited Bernie people to speak at events, use the=
 party office, begged Bernie to come to Houston when he found out they were=
 going to Dallas, but hasn=E2=80=99t let the Hillary people have the same a=
dvantages.&nbsp; 25% of Dem votes come from Houston alone.&nbsp; With Berni=
e hiring paid staff in later states and not dropping the DNC lawsuit, it be=
comes all the more important for us to consider that this might be a long p=
rimary and that every delegate will matter.&nbsp; The DEMS/liberals of Texa=
s were mighty burned after 2014 and that situation coupled with Texas=E2=80=
=99 innate outsider personality, makes Texas ripe for Bernie.&nbsp; The fun=
draiser only events are upsetting and discouraging folks as well, big time.=
&nbsp; It=E2=80=99s even becoming a problem for the fundraisers because eve=
ry time they post that an event is happening, they are immediately met with=
 complaints that regular people can=E2=80=99t afford that.&nbsp; The appear=
ance of it has even turned off some Hillary supporters, not to mention how =
it must look to those on the fence, or undecideds.&nbsp; Texas is the size =
of 5 states and one organizer will not be enough, although even one would b=
e appreciated at this point. They are less than a month and a half away fro=
m early voting.&nbsp; Anyway things can be expedited? We have super volunte=
ers with a year of VAN experience, on the ground campaign experience, and o=
rganizing experience, ready to go! We need a green light and fuel! Presiden=
t Bill Clinton is very popular, could he be sent?&nbsp; To do some free tow=
nhall/rallies. &nbsp; I can't stress enough importance of investing in TEXA=
S.&nbsp;</span></div><div class=3D"yiv2995836235" id=3D"yiv2995836235yui_3_=

mall Dollar Donations: Kim Frederick recruited me finally to be a Hill-Rais=
er. It would be great if we could build up/encourage low dollar donations b=
y using incentive's like you do for the Hill-Raisers.&nbsp; Take the $1 a d=
ay, $3 a day, or $5 a day pledge, provide a donation link with those option=
s (that can be tied to a Hillraiser too) and having a recurring button that=
 automatically does that for the donor who is taking the pledge.&nbsp; Upon=
 completing the pledge, each level, $1, $3, $5, gets a special button :) &n=
bsp;That really would help drive up the number of low dollar donations and =
reward folks for participating!&nbsp; Maybe provide incentives to Hill-Rais=
ers who get a certain percentage of their donations from $100 or less? Also=
, we need an army of surrogates out there for $25-$100 events.&nbsp; I'm se=
eing surrogate events that are wayyyy too high and not diverse at all.&nbsp=
