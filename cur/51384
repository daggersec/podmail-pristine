John, Jake, Maya,

I saw Mary Kay Henry tonight and as John knows, she's trying to organize
her union to support Hillary without a lot of sturm and drang.  This event
next week, as well as other union meetings are part of that.  One thing she
wants to do is have her home health care leadership meet with me to discuss
importance of home health care for the next few years.  They don't have a
specific ask, but they just want to be raised.  Her staff asked me to do it
and I said yes weeks ago; as John knows, we have a robust partnership with
them.  But tonight she told me that she's looking at me for this meeting as
both president of CAP and the role that plays in the progressive
infrastructure as well as a Hillary person, which I wasn't aware of
before.  She's seeing this as one of the steps (although I assume a minor
one) to get the union where it needs to be.

They may tweet that they are doing this meeting w/ me, but they'll use my
normal title -  seems to me she's likely to spin it a bit internally
though.

So I wanted to make sure I flagged this for you and that you guys are ok
with me proceeding.

Let me know and thanks!

Neera
