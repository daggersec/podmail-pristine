John,

I've tried to connect with you by phone today a couple of times with no luck.

At the end of our meeting yesterday, I raised the problem of press inquiries with the President-elect.  I leave for Estonia this evening and will have a full press contingent on the plane.  My mantra with them for months has been that I am planning on returning to the northwest in January.  That would now be misleading.

The President-elect suggested I get in touch with you and get your thinking on this.  I think I can probably get by for a few days by saying "I have nothing to share with you" and holding that line.  Because that's different than my earlier line, it likely will cause a lot more speculation (than is already out there), but doesn't give them anything.  I am more concerned if I get a direct question whether I have met with or talked with the President-elect.  My inclination would be to confirm that we have had a conversation and hold the line at that.  You all could then be in a position to say he's talking to a lot of people.  Period.  Finally, if there is a leak of our meeting yesterday (there were more than a few firefighters, police and others at the site), my inclination would be to confirm it and refuse to say anything else.

I don't mind stonewalling, but I do not want to mislead or speak falsely.

Sorry to go on, but I'd appreciate your reaction and advice regarding the above.

This is my personal e-mail account and only I have access to it.  You can respond by e-mail or call me at home at 202-785-0201.  I will be home today from 2:30 to 3:30 and then from about 6:15 to 8 p.m.

I'd also appreciate your letting me know by e-mail if there is a leak in the next few days, and how you intend to respond.

At the Pentagon, the only people who know about this are my chief of staff, Robert Rangel, and my Senior Military Assistant, Lt. Gen Dave Rodriguez.

Thanks,

Bob Gates
