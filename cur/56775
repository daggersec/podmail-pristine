                                    [1][IMG]
      Dear Friend,

   [1][IMG]

   I want to talk to you about [2]Colorado's air. In order to do that, first
   I have to talk to you about West Virginia's water.

   First thing I should tell you is, I'm a West Virginian, born and raised.
   If you don't know much about West Virginia and West Virginians, let me
   give you a quick primer. We're a proud, independent, close-knit lot. Life
   has never been easy for folks in West Virginia, so we're never surprised
   when bad things happen.

   This past week, bad things happened in West Virginia. If you haven't hea=
rd
   yet, there was a nasty chemical spill--a really toxic chemical used to
   process coal leaked into the Elk River just upstream from where a major
   water supplier takes in the water they deliver to West Virginians. For an
   entire week, 300,000 folks haven't been able to drink their water, take a
   bath, cook, or do laundry. And the smell...folks back home tell me the
   smell is something awful. Take a second are [3]read this article about
   what's happening in West Virginia, because it's really important to
   something that's [4]happening right here in Colorado.

   See, back home in West Virginia, coal is life. It means jobs and food on
   the table and clothes on your kids' backs. When a state gives itself over
   to an industry the way West Virginia has to coal, things get a little out
   of whack. You don't get elected to office in West Virginia [5]unless you
   support the coal industry 100%. That means when it comes to things like
   regulations and protecting the environment, there's really no one to sta=
nd
   up and speak out. That's what we saw happen last week. A chemical holding
   plant hadn't been inspected in over 20 years. So, when thousands of
   gallons of a toxic substance leaked into a major water source for the
   state, there's really no one to blame. It just happened. Bad things happ=
en
   to West Virginians. We shrug our shoulders, help out our neighbors and
   keep our distrust of the government firmly in place.

   What's all this have to do with Colorado? Colorado is more of an oil and
   gas state than a coal state. We've seen a pretty good boom these past few
   years in oil and gas drilling. It's good for the economy. It brings in
   jobs and tax revenue. But oil and gas has its own types of pollution to
   worry about. Methane gas leaking from wells and storage tanks is one of
   the big ones. That pollution goes into our air and then into our lungs a=
nd
   causes people to get sick and to suffer.

   We live in Colorado because it's a beautiful, special place. We love our
   mountains. We love to be outdoors. [6]None of that is worth much if you
   can't breathe the air. Just like folks in West Virginia are struggling
   right now because they can't drink their water.

   But Colorado isn't West Virginia. We haven't completely given ourselves
   over to an industry and let them run roughshod over us. We believe out
   here that you can drill for oil and gas, give people good jobs, and still
   protect our land and our air. Coloradans tend to step up and fight for
   that.

   And there's a fight brewing right now. There's a commission--called the
   Colorado Air Quality Control Commission--writing the rules to govern how
   the oil and gas industry regulate their emissions. Scientists,
   environmentalists and responsible leaders in the oil and gas industry all
   came together and wrote a first-of-its-kind draft rule that would set the
   standard for regulating the emissions that come from oil and gas
   production. Groups that don't always agree with each other sat down and
   worked together to set rules to help Colorado have cleaner air, without
   hurting the economy. Gov. Hickenlooper supports this draft rule and is
   standing behind it. It's something we should be proud of.

   But there's a problem. We have some responsible industry leaders who are
   working to do the right thing for Colorado--Noble, Encana, Anadarko. But
   there are others who want to keep these rules as lax as possible so they
   can be free to pollute as much as they want. The Colorado Oil and Gas
   Association and the Colorado Petroleum Association are working to gut
   these rules. They want a free pass to pollute our air, make our children
   sick, hurt our economy and the beauty that is Colorado.

   [7]We can't let them do this.

   All we need to do is take a look at West Virginia to see what happens wh=
en
   you let industry become irresponsible and pollute without consequence.

   I love West Virginia. I love Colorado. I'm hoping my new home state can
   learn a lot from the lessons my childhood home state is learning the hard
   way.

   The final rule will be decided in February. [8]Sign our petition. Stand
   with Gov. Hickenlooper and support clean air in Colorado. We can't afford
   not to.

   Thanks,
   Jen Caltrider
