This has been deployed to the AP in advance of a setup story they are doing
with State's help.

Mike Schmidt is now inquiring as well so I've made them aware that they
have competition.

At the moment the plan for Schmidt will simply be to deploy this with him
as well, but I will stall briefly.

Based on conversations today, below is the finalized version of the
response plan:

*Q: The State Department says that at least 16 of the emails
that Sid Blumenthal turned over to the Benghazi Select Committee were not
included in the 55,000 pages of materials produced by Hillary Clinton.
Doesn't this prove that Hillary Clinton deleted certain emails at some
point before producing them to the Department?*

*ON-THE-RECORD RESPONSE FROM SPOKESMAN NICK MERRILL:*

"Hillary Clinton has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State
Department, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."

*ADDITIONAL POINTS ON BACKGROUND FROM CLINTON AIDE:*

Not only did Clinton turn over all emails that she has from Blumenthal, she
actually turned over more than a dozen emails that were not included in
what Mr. Blumenthal handed over to the House committee.

We do not have a record of other correspondence between Mrs. Clinton and
Mr. Blumenthal beyond that which was turned over to the State Department.
In terms of the documents provided by Mr. Blumenthal to the House
committee, we do not recognize many of those materials and cannot speak to
their origin.

*OFF RECORD, if pressed on whether we are essentially admitting the
possibility that she deleted some emails:*

Look, we do not know what these materials are, or where they came from.
Just take a look at them: many of the documents are not even formatted as
emails.

But even if Sid is right and some of these documents were at some point
sent to Clinton, there is nothing in any of these emails that is remotely
new or interesting. Indeed, none of these 16 emails are qualitatively
different than the dozens of others that Hillary already produced to the
State Department. So it is completely ridiculous to suggest that there
might have been any nefarious basis for her to want to delete any of Sid's
correspondence.
