Ana

I just saw Bruce at the hospital this afternoon.  He is in great spirits.
He asked me to ask you access his computer to send the following message
from his email to all staff and the initiative heads.  He advised that you
have access to his account.  I am copying him and John Podesta on this
email.

thanks.
