Highlight #1
*Lindsey Graham Defends McCain's Iraq Stance* (CNN 07/21/08 4:14pm)
WOLF BLITZER: Nouri al-Maliki told *Der Spiegel* and we went back and looke=
d
at the Arabic, how it was translated into German and he said he more or les=
s
agrees with Senator Obama, that a 16-month timetable is good for Iraq. *Tha=
t
sort of pulls the rug out of the Bush Administration and Senator McCain tha=
t
says there should be no such timetable.*

LINDSEY GRAHAM: As I understand what he said in his statement that followed
the *Der Spiegel *interview was that everything's conditions based. I wish
we could bring the troops home tomorrow, but it's going to be based on what
we leave behind. The whole idea of how you leave is important. The goal is
to leave Iraq behind where we won and the terrorists in Iran lost.
That's the goal. The way you do that is make sure troops come home based on
conditions, not artificial timetables. *Maliki has not endorsed an
artificial timetable. It's always conditions based*. Senator Obama says 16
months without conditions, which is undercutting.

BLITZER: But senator, the prime minister, in that answer to *Der* *Spiegel*=
,
he referred to what Barack Obama said. He said the 16-month timetable sound=
s
more or less pretty good to him.

GRAHAM: Well, he also said today and yesterday that it's based on
conditions. Senator McCain said, in 2013, at the end of his first team, he
envisions Iraq where most the troops are gone and we're out of the combat
business. We all see a day soon rather than later that we can come home, bu=
t
the goal has always been to secure Iraq to make sure we win. Senator Obama'=
s
never seen Iraq in terms of the global struggle.

He wants to leave. He wanted to leave instead of do the surge and leaving i=
s
not the goal. Winning is the goal and we're going to leave winning.

BLITZER: He also makes the point that he opposed the war from the beginning
and senator McCain was in, in his words, basically a cheerleader for the
war. and he sees that as the biggest blunder in U.S. foreign policy since
the cold war.

GRAHAM: All I can tell you is that a world with Saddam Hussein is not a
better world. In the Obama world, Saddam Hussein would still be in power,
and you know how the U.N. oil for food program was working. I'm glad Saddam
Hussein's out of power. I'm glad he's dead and I'm glad we have a chance to
create in the heart of the Arab world a democratic government where Sunni,
Kurds and Shias can live in peace, reject Iran, and deliver against
al-Qaeda.

BLITZER: Knowing what you know right now, Senator Graham, and knowing what
Senator McCain knows right now, even though there were no WMD, no links
between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda or 9/11, you still think it was a good
idea to go to war?

*GRAHAM: Absolutely.* I am glad that the Saddam Hussein regime is over. I'm
glad a democracy's beginning to emerge in the heart of the Arab world. We
screwed this up a hundred ways off the fall of Baghdad. Senator Obama said
the surge would fail. He was wrong. When he comes back from Iraq, I wish he
would acknowledge two things, that the surge worked and we're going to win.

BLITZER: The other point he's making is that the U.S. took the eye off the
ball, the al-Qaeda/Taliban ball in Afghanistan, devoted energy to Iraq, and
right now we're paying potentially a very disastrous price in Afghanistan,
which he sees as the heart of the war on terror right now because we
neglected Afghanistan at the expense, because of Iraq. Do you want to
respond to that charge?

GRAHAM: Yeah, I would. *The heart of the war is not a place. It's an
idea.*The reason al-Qaeda followed us into Iraq is the worst nightmare
for the
al-Qaeda/bin Laden regime to have a group of Sunni Kurds and Shias living
together in peace, *where a woman can have a say about her children*.
Al-Qaeda came to Iraq to make sure that this experiment in democracy would
fail because it would be a big blow to their agenda.

The biggest success of all from the surge is that Muslims in Iraq turned on
the al-Qaeda with our help. They delivered a punishing blow to al-Qaeda. Th=
e
biggest loser in the surge has been al-Qaeda.

You've got to win in Iraq and you also have to win in Afghanistan. To say
that Iraq was not central to the overall war on terror misunderstands what
would happen if you lost. If we lost, Iran would fill a vacuum. They would
be stronger. If al-Qaeda had run us out of Iraq, then they would claim
victory and moderation would be really hard to find in the Middle East.
We're winning in Iraq and that will help us win in Afghanistan.

Highlight #2
*Hazelbaker Talks about the NYT Rejection of McCain's Op-Ed* (FNC 07/21/08
2:15pm)
JILL HAZELBAKER We submitted to the *New York Times* in response to Senator
Obama. Obviously, they have different worldviews when it comes to Iraq and
Afghanistan and we wanted an opportunity to state our side. We have
elections in this country, not coronations. It is unfortunate that they
would not allow their readers to hear from John McCain.

TRACE GALLAGHER: We called them for comment but they did not respond. We're
talking about one of the biggest newspapers in the country in the country
that wants the presumptive GOP candidate=97and they want to help him set
policy and give him his opinion in his editorial page.

HAZELBAKER: I would also say that we have been flooded with calls from
newspapers around the country saying that they would be happy to have his
position published. It's clear that this is where the candidates converge.
John McCain has always been vocal in bringing home the troops in victory,
based on conditions on the ground, and in the concert with the military.

Barack Obama has a timetable that is based on=97regardless of the facts on =
the
ground. We wanted to state that clearly. Of course, Barack Obama had a
chance t o make his case.

GALLAGHER: I know that we are starting to finger-point, but there is very o=
f
little love lost between the newspaper and John McCain. Now we have Barack
Obama traveling with three network anchors and now the *New York
Times*gives Barack Obama this platform and will not give it to John
McCain. [=85]

HAZELBAKER: *It's not our job to police the media coverage*. It's our job i=
s
to try and inform the voters, which is what we tried to do when we offered
up this editorial by Senator McCain to the *New York Times*. *It is
unproductive for us to complain about the media coverage.*

We simply want to make the case directly to the voters. These two candidate=
s
have different views and it is important that the voters hear from both of
them [...]. We think that the American voter is smart enough to make this
call on their own.

GALLAGHER: [=85] Give me John McCain's reaction. I know the diplomacy line,
and have gotten yours, but he must have been *fit to be tied* when they tol=
d
him, 'Well we'll run your op-ed as long as you give us a timetable for troo=
p
withdrawal from Iraq.'

HAZELBAKER: *Well, as you know, Senator McCain is a man of principle. He
always puts it a head of politics.* I think that's one of the starkest
contrasts between John McCain's position on timetables vis-=E0-vis Barack
Obama. John McCain believes we need to do what's right based on the
conditions on the ground and the views of the commanders in the region.
Barack Obama simply wants to get out of Iraq regardless of the facts on the
ground.

I can't speak for Senator McCain's personal reaction, but *he's been in thi=
s
business long enough* not to worry about media bias or media coverage. [=85=

Highlight # 3
*McCain Struggles to Gain Some of the Spotlight* (ABC 07/21/08 6:38pm)
CHARLES GIBSON: Senator John McCain had hoped to take the spotlight off of
Obama's trip by using this week to talk about his own energy policy, what h=
e
would do to lower gas prices and find new sources of oil, but *his message
was somewhat drowned* *out* by repeated questions about his differences wit=
h
Obama on the war. [...]

RON CLAIBORNE: [...] McCain never really got off the ground, talking about
those domestic, pocketbook issues. Instead he was diverted and, at times,
diverted himself into going after Obama over Iraq. McCain paid a visit to
former President Bush today at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport,
Maine. Meeting with reporters, the talk quickly turned toward Iraq and
McCain wasted no time attacking Obama for opposing the troop surge.

JOHN MCCAIN: Senator Obama could not have gone to Iraq as he did because he
opposed the surge. It was the surge that succeeded. It was the surge that's
winning this war.

[...]

CLAIBORNE: The McCain [...] privately denounces Obama's jaunt around the
world as political theater and they are infuriated by what they consider a
media circus accompanying it. At a rally in South Portland, a fired up
McCain lashed out again at Obama's opposition to the surge.

MCCAIN: He said [the surge] would fail and he refuses, to this day, to
acknowledge that it's succeeded. My friends, that's what judgment is all
about! That's why I'm qualified to lead and I don't need any on-the-job
training.

[McCain ad segment]

CLAIBORNE: The plan for this week--counter-program by keeping the focus on
the economy and once again raising the proposal to end the federal ban on
offshore drilling for oil. *Today the McCain campaign released this new
television ad that even seems to blame Obama for rising prices at the pump.=
*

[Gas price segment of McCain ad]

CLAIBORNE: McCain will travel today through several key swing states [...].
The McCain says it has an event it won't reveal that is supposed to capture
some of the spotlight the same day Obama delivers a major speech in Berlin*=
.
The McCain campaign knows it will be eclipsed mostly this week by Obama's
foreign trip.*

What they're hoping to get is a lot of local media attention in those state=
s
that he'll be visiting, talking about issues they say voters care about mor=
e
than Obama meeting with foreign heads of state.

[...]

GIBSON: This has got to be very frustrating for John McCain [...]. He wants
to make his points, he wants to get coverage and yet, everything seems to
swarm around Barack Obama.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS: The good news for John McCain is that this will be
six or seven days on national security policy where he still does have an
advantage [...]. The bad news is Barack has all the anchors going over on
this trip. [...]

*CBS Reports on McCain's Attempts to Respond to Obama's Middle East Trip *(=
CBS
07/21/08 6:35pm)
KATIE COURIC: Meanwhile, there is another campaign going on, back in the
United States Senator John McCain today said that he is the one who has bee=
n
consistently right about Iraq and Afghanistan while Senator Obama has been
consistently wrong=85

JIM AXELROD: Visiting the first President Bush in Maine, John McCain
forcefully said about his rival's trip: hang on just a second

JOHN MCCAIN:  Senator Obama could not have gone to Iraq as he did because h=
e
opposed the surge.

AXELROD: To dull the shine of Iraq leaders endorsing Obama's withdrawal
timeline, McCain reminded voters that  Obama was against t the same surge
that has now made all this drawdown talk possible=85

AXELROD: In the Battle of campaign imagery even McCain's own former Press
secretary concedes this just isn't his week
=85
AXELROD: McCain's camp is criticizing what it sees as phoning coverage from
a pro-Obama media and the New York times op-ed page is the latest evidence.
After Obama laid out his Iraq policy in a column, McCain submitted a
response "I was an early advocate of the war" he wrote. "Senator Obama was
an equally vocal opponent."  The papers op-ed editor Shipley a former
Clinton speech writer declined to publish it, saying he be pleased to look
at another draft if it would lay out a clear plan for achieving victory.
=85
AXELROD:* One senior Republican strategist says that if Obama's trip is
successful it could mark a new chapter for the McCain campaign because if
Obama does narrow the policy creditability gap McCain will have to start
confronting him much more directly.*

*McCain Talks Domestic Policy During Obama's International Trip *(NBC
07/21/08 7:05pm)
KELLY O"DONNELL : =85 The people around McCain say that they think American
voters already give him high marks for is Commander-In-Chief  credentials s=
o
they are happy to talk about foreign policy, but this week they saw an
opening to do something Obama is not, talk about domestic issues. Going for
that summertime feel, today John McCain's campaign threw a picnic and rally
in Portland Maine an all American setting to contrast Obama's travels
overseas with a focus on the economy and gas prices
=85
O'DONNELL: Taking it up a notch, *McCain's new TV ad puts blame on Obama's
opposition to off shore drilling* =85 McCain says Obama could not have made
his trip to Iraq safely without the troop surge=85 Differences over the war
spilled into an editorial page battle.
=85
O'DONNELL: Asked today if he believes US troops could be out of Iraq within
two years McCain says yes he believes they could be largely withdrawn by
then, based on conditions on the ground.

Highlight #4
*McCain's Iraq Position Pushed to Nearly "Extremist" Position* (MSNBC
07/21/08 06:10pm)
EUGENE ROBINSON: It leaves McCain essentially appealing to what has become
almost an extremist position, I mean even President Bush is now talking
about a "Time Horizon"  for Iraq. Now I'm not sure the difference between a
time horizon, a time line, a time frame a, you know, a time table, but in
any event it's a time something and McCain is almost left out there by
himself saying no time anything so I think it definitely hurts him. And you
know one wonders why Maliki did it, because he is not an unsophisticated ma=
n
and he kind of did it twice =85

CHRIS MATTHEWS: Margaret does this make him look like one of those Japanese
soldiers that held out in one of those islands long after the war was over?

MARARET CARLSON: And just about as old Chris, is that the question?

MATTHEWS: No, I am just asking, they were young soldiers at the time the Wa=
r
ended.

CARLSON: You know, the surge for McCain means that we stay indefinitely and
he will not have the word Time in any proposal that he is behind so I think
both Maliki and Bush have now hurt McCain because they are both using the
word time with different nouns, ones horizon ones table but you know Obama'=
s
idea is that the surge gives us time to successfully get out, carefully get
out of Iraq. McCain thinks that the surge gives us time to stay in until we
have a Jeffersonian democracy, and I don't think the American people are
there as much as America likes to win, I think they are happy now to declar=
e
victory and get out

al-Maliki told <i>Der Spiegel</i> and we </span>went
back and looked at the Arabic, how it was translated into German and he sai=
d he
more or less agrees with Senator Obama, that a 16-month timetable is good f=
or
Iraq. <b>That sort of pulls the rug out of
the Bush Administration and Senator McCain that says there should be no suc=
h
timetable.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>LINDSEY GRAHAM: As I understand what he said in
his statement that followed the <i>Der
Spiegel </i>interview was that everything&#39;s conditions based. I wish we=
 could
bring the troops home tomorrow, but it&#39;s going to be based on what we l=
eave
behind. The whole idea of how you leave is important. The goal is to leave =
Iraq
behind where we won and the terrorists in Iran lost.<br>That&#39;s the goal=
. The way you do that is make sure
troops come home based on conditions, not artificial timetables. <b>Maliki =
has not endorsed an artificial
timetable. It&#39;s always conditions based</b>. Senator Obama says 16 mont=
hs
without conditions, which is undercutting.<br>&nbsp;<br>BLITZER: But senato=
r, the prime minister, in that
answer to <i>Der</i> <i>Spiegel</i>, he referred to what Barack Obama said.=
 He said the
16-month timetable sounds more or less pretty good to him.<br>&nbsp;<br>GRA=
HAM: Well, he also said today and yesterday that
it&#39;s based on conditions. Senator McCain said, in 2013, at the end of h=
is first
team, he envisions Iraq where most the troops are gone and we&#39;re out of=
 the
combat business. We all see a day soon rather than later that we can come h=
ome,
but the goal has always been to secure Iraq to make sure we win. Senator Ob=
ama&#39;s
never seen Iraq in terms of the global struggle.<br>&nbsp;<br>He wants to l=
eave. He wanted to leave instead of
do the surge and leaving is not the goal. Winning is the goal and we&#39;re=
 going
to leave winning.<br>&nbsp;<br>BLITZER: He also makes the point that he opp=
osed
the war from the beginning and senator McCain was in, in his words, basical=
ly a
cheerleader for the war. and he sees that as the biggest blunder in U.S.
foreign policy since the cold war.<br>&nbsp;<br>GRAHAM: All I can tell you =
is that a world with
Saddam Hussein is not a better world. In the Obama world, Saddam Hussein wo=
uld
still be in power, and you know how the U.N. oil for food program was worki=
ng.
I&#39;m glad Saddam Hussein&#39;s out of power. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s dead =
and I&#39;m glad we have
a chance to create in the heart of the Arab world a democratic government w=
here
Sunni, Kurds and Shias can live in peace, reject Iran, and deliver against =
al-Qaeda.<br>&nbsp;<br><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">BLITZER: Knowing
what you know right now, Senator Graham, and knowing what Senator McCain kn=
ows
right now, even though there were no WMD, no links between Saddam Hussein a=
nd
al-Qaeda or 9/11, you still think it was a good idea to go to war?</span><b=
r><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br><b>GRAHAM: Absolutely=
.</b>
I am glad that the Saddam Hussein regime is over. I&#39;m glad a democracy&=
#39;s
beginning to emerge in the heart of the Arab world. We screwed this up a
hundred ways off the fall of Baghdad. Senator Obama said the surge would fa=
il.
He was wrong. When he comes back from Iraq, I wish he would acknowledge two
things, that the surge worked and we&#39;re going to win.<br>&nbsp;<br>BLIT=
ZER: The other point he&#39;s making is that the
U.S. took the eye off the ball, the al-Qaeda/Taliban ball in Afghanistan,
devoted energy to Iraq, and right now we&#39;re paying potentially a very
disastrous price in Afghanistan, which he sees as the heart of the war on
terror right now because we neglected Afghanistan at the expense, because o=
f
Iraq. Do you want to respond to that charge?<br>&nbsp;<br>GRAHAM: Yeah, I w=
ould. <b>The heart of the war is not a place. It&#39;s an idea.</b> The rea=
son
al-Qaeda followed us into Iraq is the worst nightmare for the al-Qaeda/bin =
Laden
regime to have a group of Sunni Kurds and Shias living together in peace, <=
b>where a woman can have a say about her
children</b>. Al-Qaeda came to Iraq to make sure that this experiment in
democracy would fail because it would be a big blow to their agenda.<br>&nb=
sp;<br>The biggest success of all from the surge is that
Muslims in Iraq turned on the al-Qaeda with our help. They delivered a
punishing blow to al-Qaeda. The biggest loser in the surge has been al-Qaed=
a.<br>&nbsp;<br>You&#39;ve got to win in Iraq and you also have to win
in Afghanistan. To say that Iraq was not central to the overall war on terr=
or
misunderstands what would happen if you lost. If we lost, Iran would fill a
vacuum. They would be stronger. If al-Qaeda had run us out of Iraq, then th=
ey
would claim victory and moderation would be really hard to find in the Midd=
le
East. We&#39;re winning in Iraq and that will help us win in Afghanistan.<b=

have elections in this country, not coronations. It is unfortunate that the=

called them for comment but they did not respond. We&#39;re talking about o=

the biggest newspapers in the country in the country that wants the presump=

on in
his editorial page.<br>&nbsp;<br>HAZELBAKER: I would also
say that we have been flooded with calls from newspapers around the country
saying that they would be happy to have his position published. It&#39;s cl=
ear that
this is where the candidates converge. John McCain has always been vocal in
bringing home the troops in victory, based on conditions on the ground, and=
 in the
concert with the military.<br>&nbsp;<br>Barack Obama has a
timetable that is based on=97regardless of the facts on the ground. We want=

state that clearly. Of course, Barack Obama had a chance t o make his case.=
<br>&nbsp;<br>GALLAGHER: I know that
we are starting to finger-point, but there is very of little love lost betw=
een
the newspaper and John McCain. Now we have Barack Obama traveling with thre=
e
network anchors and now the <i>New York
Times</i> gives Barack Obama this platform and will not give it to John McC=
ain.
[=85]<br>&nbsp;<br>HAZELBAKER: <b>It&#39;s not our job to police the media
coverage</b>. It&#39;s our job is to try and inform the voters, which is wh=
at we
tried to do when we offered up this editorial by Senator McCain to the <i>N=
ew York Times</i>. <b>It is unproductive for us to complain about the media=
 coverage.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>We simply want to make
the case directly to the voters. These two candidates have different views =
and
it is important that the voters hear from both of them [...]. We think that=
 the
American voter is smart enough to make this call on their own.<br>&nbsp;<br=
>GALLAGHER: [=85] Give me
John McCain&#39;s reaction. I know the diplomacy line, and have gotten your=
s, but
he must have been <b>fit to be tied</b>
when they told him, &#39;Well we&#39;ll run your op-ed as long as you give =
us a
timetable for troop withdrawal from Iraq.&#39;<br>&nbsp;<br>HAZELBAKER: <b>=
Well, as you know, Senator McCain is a man
of principle. He always puts it a head of politics.</b> I think that&#39;s =
one of
the starkest contrasts between John McCain&#39;s position on timetables vis=
-=E0-vis
Barack Obama. John McCain believes we need to do what&#39;s right based on =
the
conditions on the ground and the views of the commanders in the region. Bar=

Obama simply wants to get out of Iraq regardless of the facts on the ground=
.<br>&nbsp;<br>I can&#39;t speak for
Senator McCain&#39;s personal reaction, but <b>he&#39;s
