I think it is slightly complicated to do this in her voice pre-hearing. It
will become the thing that is quoted since we are not doing excerpts of her
opening as of now, and the headlines we would get would be her decrying the
partisan nature of the committee as opposed to what she will say in her
true opening, which is intended to come off as a tribute to Stevens and the
fallen, and then decry the politicizing in defense of their memories,
rather than her campaign. Could we either (a)  send in John's name or (b)
do option 2?
