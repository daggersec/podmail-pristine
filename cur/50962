Hey John, know it's crazy, but definitely need to catch up with you.  I
understand you'll be out our way in the Bay Area the week after next--let
me know if you've got a few minutes--or if you think I should be talking to
someone else about the campaign.  In contact with Ann and Amanda, helping
recruit diver talent, etc, but I want to discuss more formal role.  also
want to bring you up to date with effort on voter mobilization efforts am
involved in (some of which I shared with our candidate).  Have a great
weekend.  Maria
PS Eryn, copied you on this just so you can give him a nudge, did you have
to move to brooklyn?  My stepson lives there and it's impossible to find a
reasonable place to live!!
