Hi Dan,

Thanks for sending this along! This as close to perfect as I have every
read anything - LOVE IT!

Just have a few things for you to pls consider:

   - This will seem tiny and maybe even petty, but can Dina Titus please be
   acknowledged before Catherine Cortez Masto?
   - Also, all over Nevada people reference her trips to this state even
   before she ran for President, for example in the early 2000s to visit
   Fallon's Leukemia bubble. Would love to find a way to incorporate her
   Nevada roots and how much she loves this state, her history here.

Thanks so much for your work on this.

Emmy
