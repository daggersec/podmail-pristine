As you seem to have won the Uncle John Talks to Kurt award (which I proposed
both because I thought we needed a compromise and because I think he needs
to hear it), a couple of things.  Impression of many, including those in the
massive group of experts who have been working on the campaign, is that he
is an operator.  I agree that he is smart and insightful, but that gets
trumped by the other.  He needs to go out of his way to work with and listen
to Sarah in addition to Jim, I think.  And signal that he is a team player.
I am one of those who believes he is smart but who has also for the last
several years been on the receiving end of a strong indication that I am not
important enough for him to talk to, include in anything, or otherwise
engage, but don't think I am on personal agenda on this one (if so, I would
have said don't use him).  But do think he needs to hear from someone like
you that what we're looking for is people who are good on content and
connected but also team players.  And I'd bet money that once he finds out
what I'm doing he'll actually talk to me at the next 34th St dinner (and in
consultations, some people mentioned him but all with caveat on personal
ambition).  Anyway, he's too smart to shoot himself in the foot so good that
you are talking to him.

On another note, and as you think of those great people who should be
somewhere on national security and are not usual suspects, please shoot me
an email. Thks
