Dear all,

I was so caught off guard by your generous expression of support at the
Executive Session Friday that I did not adequately convey my deep
appreciation to you all.  It is, indeed, a privilege to serve as Knox's
19th president at this time of such economic and demographic turbulence and
such intense questioning of the value of a liberal arts education. Every
day I draw on the lessons of my own education and 45 years of experience as
a student, faculty member and administrator at colleges like Knox to make
decisions wisely and nimbly and to anticipate the next decision to arrive
on my desk. This is the job of a lifetime.

One cannot serve an institution effectively without earning the trust and
support of all the campus constituencies, to be sure, but a strong
relationship between a Board and a president is, simply put, foundational.
When I took this job, I asked for an engaged Board and candid conversations
about the future of the College.  Over the past three years, you have
enacted term limits to increase the numbers of individuals engaged with the
College in leadership, expanded executive sessions to provide space for
candor and questioning, given generously for Alumni Hall and other
projects, and reorganized meetings to sharpen our strategic deliberations
-- everything one could ask for in a Board.

And I have been much moved by your kindness to Denise throughout Dennis'
illness and to me after my father died.

Thank you, one and all.

Teresa
