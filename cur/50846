Just off the phone with our tracker Jacob who was in Youngstown tracking
McCain's events.  Here are the notes from our call:

*Background Details:
*- McCain campaign crowded most African American members of the audience
into one area -- in the center area, right behind where John McCain was
speaking
- About 400 people total were in attendance, about 5 or 6 were African
American and sitting behind McCain
- Carly Fiorina was in the audience -- she sat in the front row; McCain
introduced her as his friend and gave a bit of background on her
- Usual press outlets, local and traveling; Dana Bash was there
- Julie Smith - a local woman introduced McCain at the event
- McCain 'Time for Action' banner and fliers everywhere
*
Speech Highlights: *LINK to transcript:
http://thepage.time.com/excerpts-of-mccains-youngstown-speech/
- Said he wants to 'end corporate welfare and close the door on corporate
lobbyists'
- Said citizens will keep their homes and lenders will cut their losses
- He spoke a lot about job training programs and training workers for new
industries
- Talked about his HOME plan
- Said raising taxes on businesses 'will not bring the old jobs back and it
sure won't create new ones'
- Talked about a 'new system' for unemployment insurance
*
Q & A (at town hall):
*- Question about green technology - gave standard answer about need to
decrease dependence on foreign oil
- Questions about keeping jobs - said we need to be adaptable to new
technologies and that textile jobs are not coming back; also restated his
support for NAFTA
- Questioned about China - McCain said he would deal with China with a firm
hand -- said they need to do more with Tibet and he's not sure if he'll go
to the opening ceremonies for the Olympics
- Asked about education - said communities need to fund the schools and that
there are two tiers of education in terms of privilege and affluence

*Media Availability:
*- Lots of questions about the Democratic race
- McCain said Barack and Hillary don't understand the economy and history
- McCain said 'I'm just not an expert on these things' -- in response to a
question about democratic infighting and whether it has helped his campaign
- NCLB -- we shouldn't scrap it -- we should build, revise and fix it
- He was asked about his first 3 priorities on Foreign Policy -- he talked
mostly about international collaboration for climate change in his answer
- talked about China and WTO again -- we should use WTO to be more strenuous
on regulation and illegal dumping
- There was a question about lack of diversity in audience -- affirmative
action mentioned
McCain responded - said there's no quotas and used example of another public
official who didn't have black support but then eventually got it


Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Cammie
