Interesting talk with Rubin.  He's going to think about the various
options, but Harry Hopkins was his model.  Obviously, it would have to
work with the COS, NEC head and Treasury Secretary, but I actually think
this might well be worth exploring.  I'm in the office today, or we can
chat about it when we see each other tomorrow.
