I am trying to meet with Tom as soon as possible, but as expected he is
interested in doing his own fundraising..
I will keep you posted.

I can't speak for him but the idea was to match the 2.5 coming from

other folks, yes.



I know this is a dead horse: my team is very nervous about cash right

now and they are discussing going out on our own--especially with

Frost/AV out there. The understanding has been that we'd have a 50-50

apportionment between ground and media. I think we're all better off

with one fundraising program but my team has an almost ideological

view of the strategic window in February, March, April and May. FFA

doesn't have a functional fundraising plan at the moment that will get

us to the levels we need in the Spring. Mary Pat has a good plan--but

FFA doesn't have principals and surrogates with the time.



Anyways, something more to discuss...the key this week is to move cash.
