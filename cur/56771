John --

Our rematch against former Congressman Bobby Schilling won't be easy.

Just take a look at the numbers:

In 2012, Mr. Schilling's campaign raised and spent more than $2.5 million =
trying to win Illinois' 17th district

The total cost of that race was almost $14 million -- one of the most =
expensive in the country

Mr. Schilling is determined to make a comeback in 2014, and that means =
raising mountains of cash from right-wing groups and Tea Party darlings. =
We can fight back, but not without your help.

Will you chip in $5 or whatever you can right now to help us reach our =
August Rapid Response goal?
http://action.cheribustos.com/august27-1

Cheri pulled off a win last year, but it was because our grassroots =
supporters helped out early on. If we don't do it again, it could come =
back to bite us in 2014.

There's too much at stake to lose this race. Please chip in $5 right now:

Thanks for stepping up for Cheri,

Team Bustos
