<!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="content" -->Friend, you're a victim of your own success.

I thought Terry's goal of 500 new donors before the end of
January was a little ambitious. But I was wrong -- with
three days to spare, we already surpassed that milestone.

After this incredible show of support, I know we can achieve
anything when Virginia's future is at stake. So, I'm issuing
a new challenge: help us reach 1,000 new donors by
Thursday's fundraising deadline.

Make a $5 donation today and prove me right:

https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/8102/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=7879

I know that if we stick together, we will prove that a
strong grassroots movement will always prevail over the deep
pockets of a few conservative special interest groups.

Thank you for supporting my husband and his vision for
Virginia's future,

Dorothy McAuliffe
