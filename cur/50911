Subject: Transcript: Pope Francis=E2=80=99s speech to Congress (Wapo)
To: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>


Mr. Vice-President,

Mr. Speaker,

Honorable Members of Congress,

Dear Friends,

I am most grateful for your invitation to address this Joint Session of
Congress in =E2=80=9Cthe land of the free and the home of the brave=E2=80=
=9D. I would like
to think that the reason for this is that I too am a son of this great
continent, from which we have all received so much and toward which we
share a common responsibility.

Each son or daughter of a given country has a mission, a personal and
social responsibility. Your own responsibility as members of Congress is to
enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. You
are the face of its people, their representatives. You are called to defend
and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and
demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all
politics. A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to
satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members,
especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk.
Legislative activity is always based on care for the people. To this you
have been invited, called and convened by those who elected you.

Yours is a work which makes me reflect in two ways on the figure of Moses.
On the one hand, the patriarch and lawgiver of the people of Israel
symbolizes the need of peoples to keep alive their sense of unity by means
of just legislation. On the other, the figure of Moses leads us directly to
God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being. Moses provides
us with a good synthesis of your work: you are asked to protect, by means
of the law, the image and likeness fashioned by God on every human face.

Today I would like not only to address you, but through you the entire
people of the United States. Here, together with their representatives, I
would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of
men and women who strive each day to do an honest day=E2=80=99s work, to br=
ing home
their daily bread, to save money and =E2=80=93one step at a time =E2=80=93 =
to build a
better life for their families. These are men and women who are not
concerned simply with paying their taxes, but in their own quiet way
sustain the life of society. They generate solidarity by their actions, and
they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need.

I would also like to enter into dialogue with the many elderly persons who
are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience, and who seek in many ways,
especially through volunteer work, to share their stories and their
insights. I know that many of them are retired, but still active; they keep
working to build up this land. I also want to dialogue with all those young
people who are working to realize their great and noble aspirations, who
are not led astray by facile proposals, and who face difficult situations,
often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults. I wish to
dialogue with all of you, and I would like to do so through the historical
memory of your people.

My visit takes place at a time when men and women of good will are marking
the anniversaries of several great Americans. The complexities of history
and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for
all their many differences and limitations, were able by hard work and
self-sacrifice =E2=80=93 some at the cost of their lives =E2=80=93 to build=
 a better
future. They shaped fundamental values which will endure forever in the
spirit of the American people. A people with this spirit can live through
many crises, tensions and conflicts, while always finding the resources to
move forward, and to do so with dignity. These men and women offer us a way
of seeing and interpreting reality. In honoring their memory, we are
inspired, even amid conflicts, and in the here and now of each day, to draw
upon our deepest cultural reserves.Play Video2:17

I would like to mention four of these Americans: Abraham Lincoln, Martin
Luther King, Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton.

This year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the
assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the guardian of liberty, who
labored tirelessly that =E2=80=9Cthis nation, under God, [might] have a new=
 birth
of freedom=E2=80=9D. Building a future of freedom requires love of the comm=
on good
and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity.

All of us are quite aware of, and deeply worried by, the disturbing social
and political situation of the world today. Our world is increasingly a
place of violent conflict, hatred and brutal atrocities, committed even in
the name of God and of religion. We know that no religion is immune from
forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism. This means that we
must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism, whether
religious or of any other kind. A delicate balance is required to combat
violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology or an economic
system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom and
individual freedoms. But there is another temptation which we must
especially guard against: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good
or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners. The contemporary
world, with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and
sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization which would
divide it into these two camps. We know that in the attempt to be freed of
the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To imitate
the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take
their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject.

Our response must instead be one of hope and healing, of peace and justice.
We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve today=E2=
=80=99s
many geopolitical and economic crises. Even in the developed world, the
effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent. Our efforts
must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and
thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples. We must move
forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity,
cooperating generously for the common good.

The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of
cooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of
the United States. The complexity, the gravity and the urgency of these
challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents, and resolve to
support one another, with respect for our differences and our convictions
of conscience.

In this land, the various religious denominations have greatly contributed
to building and strengthening society. It is important that today, as in
the past, the voice of faith continue to be heard, for it is a voice of
fraternity and love, which tries to bring out the best in each person and
in each society. Such cooperation is a powerful resource in the battle to
eliminate new global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can
be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus.

Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one,
in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a community
which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and
peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. I do not underestimate
the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in this effort.

Here too I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to
Montgomery fifty years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his =E2=80=9C=
dream=E2=80=9D
of full civil and political rights for African Americans. That dream
continues to inspire us all. I am happy that America continues to be, for
many, a land of =E2=80=9Cdreams=E2=80=9D. Dreams which lead to action, to p=
articipation, to
commitment. Dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life of a
people.

In recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue their
dream of building a future in freedom. We, the people of this continent,
are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. I
say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are
also descended from immigrants. Tragically, the rights of those who were
here long before us were not always respected. For those peoples and their
nations, from the heart of American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my
highest esteem and appreciation. Those first contacts were often turbulent
and violent, but it is difficult to judge the past by the criteria of the
present. Nonetheless, when the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must
not repeat the sins and the errors of the past. We must resolve now to live
as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to
turn their back on our =E2=80=9Cneighbors=E2=80=9D and everything around us=
. Building a
nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others,
rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal
subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. I am confident that we
can do this.

Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the
Second World War. This presents us with great challenges and many hard
decisions. On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel
north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones,
in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own
children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them
as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to
respond as best we can to their situation. To respond in a way which is
always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation
nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the
Golden Rule: =E2=80=9CDo unto others as you would have them do unto you=E2=
=80=9D (Mt 7:12).

This Rule points us in a clear direction. Let us treat others with the same
passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let us seek for
others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help
others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. In a word, if we
want security, let us give security; if we want life, let us give life; if
we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. The yardstick we use
for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. The Golden
Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life
at every stage of its development.

This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate
at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. I am
convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every
human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only
benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. Recently my
brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the
abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also
offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and
necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal
of rehabilitation.

In these times when social concerns are so important, I cannot fail to
mention the Servant of God Dorothy Day, who founded the Catholic Worker
Movement. Her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of
the oppressed, were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of
the saints.

How much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the world!
How much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to
raise people out of extreme poverty! I know that you share my conviction
that much more still needs to be done, and that in times of crisis and
economic hardship a spirit of global solidarity must not be lost. At the
same time I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us
who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. They too need to be given hope. The
fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many
fronts, especially in its causes. I know that many Americans today, as in
the past, are working to deal with this problem.

It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and
distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the proper
application of technology and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise
are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive
and sustainable. =E2=80=9CBusiness is a noble vocation, directed to produci=
ng
wealth and improving the world. It can be a fruitful

source of prosperity for the area in which it operates, especially if it
sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common
good=E2=80=9D (Laudato Si=E2=80=99, 129). This common good also includes th=
e earth, a
central theme of the encyclical which I recently wrote in order to =E2=80=
=9Center
into dialogue with all people about our common home=E2=80=9D (ibid., 3). =
=E2=80=9CWe need a
conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we
are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all=E2=80=9D (ib=
id., 14).

In Laudato Si=E2=80=99, I call for a courageous and responsible effort to =
=E2=80=9Credirect
our steps=E2=80=9D (ibid., 61), and to avert the most serious effects of th=
e
environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that
we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States =E2=80=
=93 and
this Congress =E2=80=93 have an important role to play. Now is the time for
courageous actions and strategies, aimed at implementing a =E2=80=9Cculture=
 of
care=E2=80=9D (ibid., 231) and =E2=80=9Can integrated approach to combating=
 poverty,
restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature=
=E2=80=9D
(ibid., 139). =E2=80=9CWe have the freedom needed to limit and direct techn=
ology=E2=80=9D
(ibid., 112); =E2=80=9Cto devise intelligent ways of=E2=80=A6 developing an=
d limiting our
power=E2=80=9D (ibid., 78); and to put technology =E2=80=9Cat the service o=
f another type
of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more
integral=E2=80=9D (ibid., 112). In this regard, I am confident that America=
=E2=80=99s
outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital
contribution in the years ahead.

A century ago, at the beginning of the Great War, which Pope Benedict XV
termed a =E2=80=9Cpointless slaughter=E2=80=9D, another notable American wa=
s born: the
Cistercian monk Thomas Merton. He remains a source of spiritual inspiration
and a guide for many people. In his autobiography he wrote: =E2=80=9CI came=
 into
the world. Free by nature, in the image of God, I was nevertheless the
prisoner of my own violence and my own selfishness, in the image of the
world into which I was born. That world was the picture of Hell, full of
men like myself, loving God, and yet hating him; born to love him, living
instead in fear of hopeless self-contradictory hungers=E2=80=9D. Merton was=
 above
all a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time
and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church. He was also a man of
dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions.

From this perspective of dialogue, I would like to recognize the efforts
made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to
painful episodes of the past. It is my duty to build bridges and to help
all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same. When countries
which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue =E2=80=93 a dialogue wh=
ich may
have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons =E2=80=93 new
opportunities open up for all. This has required, and requires, courage and
daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. A good political leader
is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a
spirit of openness and pragmatism. A good political leader always opts to
initiate processes rather than possessing spaces (cf. Evangelii Gaudium,
222-223).

Being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly
determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed
conflicts throughout our world. Here we have to ask ourselves: Why are
deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on
individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for
money: money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face
of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the
problem and to stop the arms trade.

Three sons and a daughter of this land, four individuals and four dreams:
Lincoln, liberty; Martin Luther King, liberty in plurality and
non-exclusion; Dorothy Day, social justice and the rights of persons; and
Thomas Merton, the capacity for dialogue and openness to God.

Four representatives of the American people.

I will end my visit to your country in Philadelphia, where I will take part
in the World Meeting of Families. It is my wish that throughout my visit
the family should be a recurrent theme. How essential the family has been
to the building of this country! And how worthy it remains of our support
and encouragement! Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is
threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental
relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of
marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above
all, the richness and the beauty of family life.

In particular, I would like to call attention to those family members who
are the most vulnerable, the young. For many of them, a future filled with
countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and
aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse and despair. Their
problems

are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to face them together, to
talk about them and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged
down in discussions. At the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we
live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family,
because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture
presents others with so many options that they too are dissuaded from
starting a family.

A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty as Lincoln did,
when it fosters a culture which enables people to =E2=80=9Cdream=E2=80=9D o=
f full rights
for all their brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do;
when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day
did by her tireless work, the fruit of a faith which becomes dialogue and
sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton.

In these remarks I have sought to present some of the richness of your
cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people. It is my desire
that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people
as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many
people to dream.

God bless America!

Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred and brutal at=

mism. This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fund=
amentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. A delicate balance is r=
equired to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideolo=
gy or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intell=
ectual freedom and individual freedoms. But there is another temptation whi=
ch we must especially guard against: the simplistic reductionism which sees=
 only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners. The contemp=

sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization which would di=
vide it into these two camps. We know that in the attempt to be freed of th=
