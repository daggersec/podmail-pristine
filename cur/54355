*Child care workers are chronically underpaid, earning wages in line with
fast-food workers and retail associates.*

In the wake of minimum wage increases at Wal-Mart
<http://fortune.com/2015/02/19/walmart-wage-raise-pay-workers/> and Target
<http://fortune.com/2015/03/18/target-wages-wal-mart-t-j-maxx/>, a new
group of workers has joined the campaign that=E2=80=99s being credited for =
helping
prompt such pay hikes.

On Tuesday, child care workers will join the Fight for $15, the movement
started in 2012 by 200 fast-food workers in New York City who walked off
the job to protest low pay
<http://fortune.com/2014/12/04/fast-food-workers-15-demand-how-aiming-high-=
launched-a-social-movement/>.
When the Fight for $15 stages its next protests on April 15, child care
workers are expected to demonstrate alongside the home care workers and
airport workers who have joined the campaign since its launch.

Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union,
which backs the Fight for $15, told *Fortune* that child care workers
protesting alongside fast-food workers illustrates a dual crisis: underpaid
working parents are struggling to pay for child care and those who care for
others=E2=80=99 children are struggling to take care of their own.

Child care workers in the U.S. earn median pay of $9.38 per hour, according
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/childcare-workers.htm>.
That is comparable with the earnings of food preparation workers=E2=80=94$9=
.28 per
hour
<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/food-preparation-worke=
rs.htm>=E2=80=94and
retail sales employees=E2=80=94$10.29 per hour
<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/sales/retail-sales-workers.htm>=E2=80=94and is espe=
cially
measly when weighed against child care workers=E2=80=99 role in early child=
hood
education.

Responsive, sensitive, and secure adult-child attachments are
developmentally expected and biologically essential for young children;
their absence signals a serious threat to child well-being, according to a =
2012
study by the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child
<http://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/reports_and_working_papers/wo=
rking_papers/wp12/>.
Findings such as these help explain the child care industry=E2=80=99s growi=
ng
expectation that its workers have college degrees. The share of Head Start
teachers with an associate or bachelor=E2=80=99s degree grew by 61%; for as=
sistant
teachers, it increased by 24%
<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ReportFINAL.=
pdf>
between 1997 and 2013.

And yet child care workers regularly earn less than adults who take care of
animals
<http://www.bls.gov/ooh/personal-care-and-service/animal-care-and-service-w=
orkers.htm>.
Indeed, Head Start achieved its goal of having at least half of its
teaching force hold a bachelor=E2=80=99s or advanced degree in early childh=
ood
education by September 2013, but its employees=E2=80=99 salaries have not k=
ept up
with inflation since 2007
<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ReportFINAL.=

.

=E2=80=9CIf you look back over the last 25 years, we=E2=80=99ve learned so =
much about early
childhood development. We have a 21st century set of expectations [about
childhood development], but in many ways we still have a 20th century view
of work and pay structure [for child care workers],=E2=80=9D says Marcy Whi=
tebook,
director of the Center for the Study of Child Care Employment at the
University of California, Berkeley. =E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a gap between =
the expectations
and promise of early childhood and the way we think about the people who do
the work.=E2=80=9D

That gap is putting the quality of child care at risk. Research
<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Then-and-Now=
.pdf>
points to wages as a key factor in the retention of high-qualified
teachers, which, in turn, is the best predictor of whether a child care
center maintains quality over time.

Low wages inflict additional harm on the individuals who are providing the
care.

Corrine Hall, a 53-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina who has worked in
child care for 30 years, told *Fortune* she currently earns $8.25 per hour
serving as a substitute caregiver at various child care centers. She was
laid off from a full-time job two years ago. In the three decades she has
worked in the field, she=E2=80=99s never earned more than $13 per hour. Her=
 low
wages forced her to use food stamps earlier in her career as she cared for
two daughters by herself. She has little savings for retirement. =E2=80=9CI=
 don=E2=80=99t
have anything to fall back on. Hopefully social security will be around.
Other than that and my family, that=E2=80=99s pretty much all I have,=E2=80=
=9D she says.

Hall is far from alone in her reliance on public assistance. In 2012, 46%
of child care workers=E2=80=94versus 25% of the nationwide total workforce=
=E2=80=94was a
member of a family enrolled in at least one of four public support
programs: the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit, Medicaid and the Children=
=E2=80=99s
Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,
and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, according to a 2014 study by
the Berkeley Center
<http://www.irle.berkeley.edu/cscce/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ReportFINAL.=
pdf>
.

Underlying the wage issue is the high cost of child care itself, which
makes industry workers=E2=80=99 poor pay all the more surprising. For paren=
ts,
full-time infant care costs
<http://usa.childcareaware.org/sites/default/files/19000000_state_fact_shee=
ts_2014_v04.pdf>=E2=80=94on
average=E2=80=94between $4,560 and $16,549 per year, depending on the state=
 and
child care center setting. For a four-year-old, it ranges from $4,039 to
$12,320. The Berkeley Center=E2=80=99s analysis shows that there=E2=80=99s =
been a two-fold
increase in the cost to parents for early childhood services since 1997. At
the same time, child care workers have experienced no increase in real
earnings, even as payroll and related expenses make up 80% of the cost of a
child care program
<http://usa.childcareaware.org/sites/default/files/19000000_state_fact_shee=
ts_2014_v04.pdf>
.

Where is the increased cost of child care going, if not to workers? Deborah
Phillips, a professor of developmental and child psychology at Georgetown
University who worked on the 2014 Berkeley study, put it bluntly: =E2=80=9C=
We have
no idea.=E2=80=9D

Phillips surmises that the increased expense could be related to the growth
of for-profit childcare centers.

Meanwhile, Rachel Demma, policy director at the Early Care and Education
Consortium, which represents child care centers, says most for-profit
providers make very little profit and, like their non-profit counterparts,
spend the lion=E2=80=99s share of their revenue on staffing expenses. She s=
aid the
growing cost of child care could be due to fluctuations in state
reimbursement rates to providers that serve needy families. M-A Lucas,
director of the Consortium, points to stricter caregiver-to-child ratios
and the increased prevalence of labor-intensive infant care as two
potential reasons for the skyrocketing costs and stagnant worker pay.

The answer to a second question may be just as hard to pin down: who will
pay for child care workers=E2=80=99 higher wages?

There=E2=80=99s little disagreement that parents are already paying enough.=
 Lucas
says she=E2=80=99s concerned about the wages of the child care workforce, b=
ut her
organization=E2=80=99s stance is to =E2=80=9Cadvocate for policies that won=
=E2=80=99t shift the
burden of increased program costs to families.=E2=80=9D

Whitebook from the Berkeley Center says early childhood education should be
a public good. =E2=80=9CLike public education, not everyone has to use it, =
but it
should be there.=E2=80=9D

and some states=E2=80=99 and cities=E2=80=99 introduction of universal pre-=

 Care
Act, which successfully established new quality standards for the
department=E2=80=99s child care providers and linked teachers=E2=80=99 trai=

pay.

=E2=80=9CPeople have solved this problem,=E2=80=9D Phillips says. =E2=80=9C=
There are multiple ways
to do this; it=E2=80=99s just about making it a national imperative for pri=

akes industry workers=E2=80=99 poor pay all the more surprising. For parent=
s, full-time infant care

costs</a>=E2=80=94on average=E2=80=94between $4,560 and $16,549 per year, d=
epending on the state and child care center setting. For a four-year-old, i=
t ranges from $4,039 to $12,320. The Berkeley Center=E2=80=99s analysis sho=
ws that there=E2=80=99s been a two-fold increase in the cost to
 parents for early childhood services since 1997. At the same time, child c=
are workers have experienced no increase in real earnings, even as

payroll and related expenses make up 80% of the cost of a child care progra=
m</a>.</p>
<p>Where is the increased cost of child care going, if not to workers? Debo=
rah Phillips, a professor of developmental and child psychology at Georgeto=
wn University who worked on the 2014 Berkeley study, put it bluntly: =E2=80=
=9CWe have no idea.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Phillips surmises that the increased expense could be related to the gro=
wth of for-profit childcare centers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rachel Demma, policy director at the Early Care and Education=
 Consortium, which represents child care centers, says most for-profit prov=
iders make very little profit and, like their non-profit counterparts, spen=
d the lion=E2=80=99s share of their revenue
 on staffing expenses. She said the growing cost of child care could be due=
 to fluctuations in state reimbursement rates to providers that serve needy=
 families. M-A Lucas, director of the Consortium, points to stricter caregi=
ver-to-child ratios and the increased
 prevalence of labor-intensive infant care as two potential reasons for the=
 skyrocketing costs and stagnant worker pay.</p>
<p>The answer to a second question may be just as hard to pin down: who wil=
l pay for child care workers=E2=80=99 higher wages?</p>
<p>There=E2=80=99s little disagreement that parents are already paying enou=
gh. Lucas says she=E2=80=99s concerned about the wages of the child care wo=
rkforce, but her organization=E2=80=99s stance is to =E2=80=9Cadvocate for =
policies that won=E2=80=99t shift the burden of increased program costs
 to families.=E2=80=9D</p>
<p>Whitebook from the Berkeley Center says early childhood education should=
 be a public good. =E2=80=9CLike public education, not everyone has to use =
it, but it should be there.=E2=80=9D</p>
