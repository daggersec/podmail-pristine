Friends and supporters,=20

I=E2=80=99m pleased to announce my candidacy for Oakland City Council Distr=
ict
2 - and would like to invite you to my Fundraising Kick-off:

Tuesday, June 15, 2010
La Estrellita at 446 E. 12th Street.
6:00pm =E2=80=93 8:00pm
Suggested donation: $50, $250, $500, $700

Now is the time -=20
Oakland faces significant challenges in unemployment, schools and
safety.  Budget decisions we make this year will impact our lives for
years to come.	So we need fresh solutions and leadership that brings
a deep commitment to community into City Hall.	My campaign is
grounded in the belief that local government can better serve our
basic needs and set up our community for long-term success. It's
possible for us to regain our faith in Oakland City Hall.  With your
support and investment in my campaign, I will champion a set of policy
solutions that will help create a city that will make us proud.

I've been listening -=20
I have spent months listening to the concerns of hundreds of parents,
merchants, and community leaders in District 2, and we all agree that
we face serious and deeply rooted problems.  It is not surprising that
Oakland residents have lost faith in their government.

I know we can do better, and I am prepared to help lead the way.  I
hope you will join me, and together, we will build a strong future for
Oakland.

Bringing my national experience home -=20
I grew up watching my mother, a first-generation immigrant who raised
two children while working and studying to become a nurse, demonstrate
what hard work and perseverance can create.  Thanks to her success, I
have been able to serve as a community organizer, public policy
advocate, and an effective leader for change at the local, state and
national levels.  I served as President of a national organization
where I worked closely with the White House, Department of Education,
and Congress on key issues affecting education.  I currently serve on
the Oakland Community Policing Advisory Board and advocate for better
public safety policies in our neighborhoods.

I'll need your time and financial support to make this campaign a
success.  Please consider investing in our campaign for Oakland by
making a donation and signing up to volunteer at
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?JenniferPaeforOaklan/8f10805594/08a29c1973/d1eed9f2=
4b.


We'll see you at the Fundraising Kick-Off on:

Tuesday, June 15, 2010
La Estrellita at 446 E. 12th Street.
6:00pm =E2=80=93 8:00pm
Suggested donation: $50, $250, $500, $700

Your support will help us reach voters who want to believe in Oakland
again.

Together we can,

Jennifer S. Pae
