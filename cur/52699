*Lt. General William Caldwell needs to be fired. Now.* General Caldwell, a
three star general in charge of training Afghanistan troops allegedly
ordered that the Army=92s arsenal of psychological weapons of war be traine=
d
on Members of Congress and other =93VIPs=94 in order to manipulate them int=
o
giving the Army more money and troops for its Afghanistan operation.

According to *Rolling
Stone*<http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/another-runaway-general-ar=
my-deploys-psy-ops-on-u-s-senators-20110223>,
the head of an Army =93Information Operations=94 unit in Afghanistan, Lt.
Colonel Michael Holmes, has been under orders from Caldwell to find
=93pressure points=94 to use against the visiting Congressional delegations=
 and
secretly manipulate them without their knowledge. Holmes quoted the
general=92s Chief of Staff:  =93What do I have to plant inside their heads?=
=94

General Caldwell should face court marshal proceedings for violating his
oath of office and US law. The Justice Department should launch an immediat=
e
investigation to determine just how widespread this propaganda operation is
and how high up the chain of command it goes. Congress should act
immediately as well. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees should
schedule public hearings and the investigative arms of both houses, as well
as the General Accounting Office, should launch investigations.

This latest *Rolling Stone* bombshell needs all the attention that the Obam=
a
administration and the Congress gave reporter Michael Hastings=92 last stor=
y
on an out-of-control General, Stanly McChrystal. *This is worse*. General
McChrystal was guilty of frat boy style insubordination. Lt. General
Caldwell, and whoever else was involved in this outrage, was attempting a
form of military coup by attacking elected civilian leaders through
psychological warfare. If you are frustrated by civilian control over your
military, take them out. In this case the weapon of choice was the arsenal
available to them by the Army=92s psychological warfare operation.

As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, I was cognizant of the
Pentagon=92s use of spin to get the result that they wanted. I was in offic=
e
for less than a month when I was invited for a personal =93consultation=94 =
with
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  I am certain that Chairman
Powell was less interested in my views of military strategy than he was of
my vote.

You can also see this dynamic at play in Bob Woodward=92s account of Presid=
ent
Obama=92s =93war=94 with the Pentagon when he was formulating his Afghanist=
an
strategy. According to =93Obama=92s Wars=94, the President was incensed and
frustrated by generals who would only provide him with options that were
anything but.  As Woodward put it, =93This was a contest that pitted the
president against the military establishment.=94 The contest ended with the
announcement of a significant escalation of US forces in Afghanistan.

The manipulation described in the Rolling Stone article, however, is
different. This is the wholesale use of a weapon of war =96 =93psy ops=94 i=
n the
military vernacular =96 to take out the independent judgment of those who a=
re
responsible for overseeing and holding accountable the US military. As Lt.
Col. Holmes put it =93My job in psy-ops is to play with people=92s heads, t=
o get
the enemy to behave the way we want them to behave.=94 To Lt. Gen. Caldwell=
,
the enemy was not al-Qaeda or even the Taliban, but the U.S. Congress.
This is a serious offense, not just against Members of Congress, but agains=
t
the United States and civilian control of the military. It must be met with
a response that is as equally serious.
