I've taken care of Jeremy -- he'll be part of the central 5th street
operation.

John and Jim,



I hope you're feeling as good about today as I am.



Per John's call a few weeks ago, I'm still ready/willing/able to help with
transition on intel matters.  However, I haven't been called to fill out
forms, report for duty somewhere, or do anything else specific (as I know
some others have been.)



In recent weeks, Marcel Lettre (Reid's office) and I had fed some
memos/ideas into Rand Beers, but now I've heard that John Brennan and Jamie
Misick are doing agency-reviews for intel.  I know I speak for Marcel when I
say that if there is a role at the transition HQ, or on this agency-review
team, we'd be happy to help.



I'll have to let my bosses know where I'm needed this week.



I know you have a million more important items on your plate in the coming
days and weeks, so I hope not to be a pest.  But just wanted to let you know
that I remain interested in assisting with the transition.
