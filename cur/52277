Dear John,

We are looking forward to seeing you on June 12th at the  League of
Conservation Voters' Capital Dinner. Thank you again for your
generous  support.

I wanted to invite you to a separate  event earlier that evening that
LCV Action Fund will be hosting  a special  reception to benefit
Senator Mark Udall (CO) and Senator Tom Udall (NM). These  cousins
have consistently led the way for environmental protections in their
respective states and need your support to make sure they are
re-elected to the  Senate in 2014. We hope you will consider joining
us and giving as generously  as you can directly to one or both of the
candidates. You give ahead of time online or write
a check at the event. RSVP to Jen Milley at Jennifer_Milley@lcv.org or
(202)  454-4568.

As you know early contributions are incredibly helpful to the
campaigns so we  hope you will consider giving as generously as you
can. We also hope you will  share this with your friends that are
attending the dinner later that evening  or that may be able to join
us for this event only. See you on June 12th!

Sincerely,
Gene
