Hi friends -

I'm really pleased to tell you all that this December, I've been chosen to =
receive an "Academy Award" from the Midwest Academy at their annual dinner.=
 This is one of the top honors in progressive politics, and I'm truly thril=
led to be receiving it. I'm even more excited to be sharing the evening  wi=
th Julian Bond, a lifelong hero of mine, and Damon Silvers of the AFL-CIO, =
a close friend and colleague, both of whom are honorees as well.

This is the second year in a row that someone tied to Iowa has won the awar=
d - my old friend Teresa Vilmain (cc'ed) won last year. This is also the se=
cond year in a row that the honoree has Arca ties - Anna Lefer Kuhn (also c=
c'ed) won the award last year. I'm flattered to be in such wonderful compan=
y and proud to receive the award from such a great organization.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with the organization, the Midwest Acad=
emy is a progressive organization that specializes in training the grass-ro=
ots organizers and leaders of tomorrow. The organizers then go to work for =
direct action organizations like Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Vo=
ters, the National Council of La Raza, Planned Parenthood, labor unions, an=
d other progressive causes. Others go on to work for city councils, state l=
egislatures, and Congress to fight for progressive causes on the Hill. Some=
 of the past honorees and/or training alumni include members of Congress su=
ch as Jan Schakowsky, Barney Frank, and Keith Ellison, along with top labor=
 leaders such as John Stocks of NEA  and Jon Youngdahl of SEIU.

I really hope that you can make it to the event- it would mean an enormous =
amount personally for you to be with me that night. I hear they are plannin=
g to make a cool video about me, but thankfully I also understand there wil=
l be time for rebuttals, which I know some of you will be sorely tempted to=
 do.

The ceremony will be on TUESDAY evening, December 4th, at Eatonville Restau=
rant, 2121 14th St, NW in DC.  RSVPs should be sent to Alicia Dailey (alici=
a@midwestacademy.com<mailto:alicia@midwestacademy.com>). The organization d=
oes wonderful work, and I'm honored that they chose to give me the Academy =
Award.

-Mike
