Dear John,=20


Growing up in Rocky Mount, North Carolina during the time of Jim Crow, =
a quality education was denied to most of us because of our skin color=2E=
 Today, thankfully, an education isn't denied to our young people becau=
se of the color of their skin, but there still exist tremendous barrier=
s to learning=2E

More than half of Maryland teachers report seeing students come to scho=
ol hungry=2E Almost half of students from low-income families are not p=
repared for school by age 5=2E And the college class of 2015 has the mo=
st student loan debt of any class in U=2ES=2E history=2E

I believe we have a collective responsibility to each other to ensure t=
hat everyone has the same opportunities to receive a quality education=2E=
 Expanding and improving educational opportunities for our young people=
 is one of the primary reasons I am running for Congress=2E But I need =
your support to get me there=2E

Your contribution of $25, $50, $100 or $250 today will allow us to comm=
unicate our vision for education with voters=20

A quality education can put our young people on a higher path that rais=
es all of our communities up=2E In Congress, I will be a strong leader =
for investing in our schools and our young people=2E

As a father of 6, I can tell you they are the best investment we could =
ever make in our future=2E

I hope can continue to count on your support,

Glenn
