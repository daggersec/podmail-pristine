In addition to the great news about Tom, Tara McGuinness, who many of you k=
now, will also be elevated to a new role here.
Tom Perriello To Head Center For American Progress Advocacy Arm


WASHINGTON -- Former Rep. Tom Perriello (D-Va.) a beloved progressive whom =
activists and party officials had pushed to consider a gubernatorial run in=
 Virginia, will instead head one of Washington D.C.'s premiere Democratic-l=
eaning advocacy organizations.

The Center for American Progress Action Fund, the advocacy arm of the liber=
al think tank, announced on Thursday that Perriello would become its next P=
resident and CEO. Joining him in the group's top ranks will be Tara McGuinn=
ess, a well-travelled party operative who will take on the dual titles of S=
enior Vice President of the Action Fund and Senior Vice President of Commun=
ications at CAP.

The announcement caps off a major period of transition for the influential =
think-tank and advocacy organization. CAP's founder, John Podesta, recently=
 stepped down from the post of president and was replaced by Neera Tanden, =
a former top adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama. Jennifer Palmieri, wh=
o headed CAP's Action Fund, recently left to take on a communications posit=
ion inside the Obama White House. Her former job, which included the title =
of Senior Vice President of Communications at CAP, will be split between Pe=
rriello and McGuinness.

"I am excited for this opportunity to join an institution that fosters the =
combination of big ideas and concrete action needed to face today's economi=
c, environmental, and security challenges," Perriello said in a statement. =
"This is a critical moment for our country to return to values of basic fai=
rness and opportunity that are bigger than any election cycle."

A favorite of both progressives and President Barack Obama, Perriello won a=
 tight race in a Republican-leaning congressional district during the 2008 =
elections. Once in Congress, he quite notably opted against tailoring his v=
otes to his district's demographics, arguing that a populist defense<http:/=
/www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/29/with-obama-coming-tom-per_n_775803.html>=
 of a progressive agenda would keep his supporters in the fold. When he los=
t his reelection bid by a relatively narrow margin in 2010, it was assumed =
that he would jump back into electoral politics either in 2012 or in 2013, =
when the Virginian governorship opens up. Instead, he's choosing to remain =
outside -- but still involved in -- that arena.



Over the past few years, CAP's Action Fund has evolved into one<http://www.=
huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/16/barack-obama-2012-campaign_n_1098115.html> of=
 the more influential partisan-policy hybrid institutions inside the beltwa=
y. Made up of a well-read blog (Think Progress), an active Twitter account,=
 and a crew of officials tasked with Hill and grassroots outreach, it has h=
elped build what is often described as a "permanent campaign infrastructure=
" for progressive candidates.



In elevating Perriello and McGuinness to top posts, the organization is sig=
naling a further commitment to expanding and modernizing these operations. =
Both are well steeped in the world of advocacy, think tanks, progressive po=
litics, and modern political media.

Prior to serving his term in Congress, Perriello helped launch and manage a=
 half dozen non-profit organizations, including Avaaz, Catholics in Allianc=
e for the Common Good, Faith in Public Life, and DarfurGenocide.org. McGuin=
ness, meanwhile, has been a behind-the-scenes force in several policy and p=
artisan related efforts. After working with Americans Against Escalation in=
 Iraq, she helped run Progressive Accountability, a 2008-focused independen=
t research shop that paved the way for similar organizations to flourish in=
 this election cycle. She also has experience on the Hill, having worked fo=
r Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and as a press secretary on Sen. John Kerry'=
s (D-Mass.) presidential campaign.

"This is an incredible team capable of creating and driving a new generatio=
n of progressive ideas," said Podesta, now chairman of the Center for Ameri=
can Progress Action Fund Board of Directors.
