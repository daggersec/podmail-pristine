Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Domestic violence afflicts far too many women in our country. But some
right wing politicians are ignoring the facts, and our New Hampshire
affiliate got some national coverage this week by highlighting a
legislator's comments about how "people are always free to
leave"=A0an abusive relationship.

This is just 1 of our 21 states doing what we do every day
-=A0make progress happen, and happen NOW.

As always, let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to
us here.

Best,

Granite State Progress Exposes Representative Warden's True
Thoughts On Domestic Violence

Representative Mark Warden made an outrageous comment regarding
victims of domestic violence in a House Criminal Justice and Public
Safety Committee session on Tuesday, February 26th. Representative
Warden said,=A0"Some people could make the argument that a
lot of people like being in abusive relationships. It's a
love-hate relationship. It's very, very common for people to
stick around with somebody they love who also abuses him or her
... People are always free to leave."

Granite State Progress caught the=A0whole=A0comment on tape, and
is calling on Representative Warden to publically apologize to victims
of domestic violence and their families. This offensive comment shows
a lack of understanding of the situations that victims of domestic
violence experience and is completely beyond comprehension.

Representative Warden's remark has spread throughout the news,
picking up local and national coverage. The comments were reported in
the=A0Concord Monitor,=A0theHuffington Post,=A0Talking Points
Memo,=A0MSNBC=A0News,=A0Democratic Legislative Campaign
Committee,=A0Salon, and Political Wire's=A0Bonus Quote of
the Day.
