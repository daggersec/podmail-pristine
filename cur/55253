Our vetting process begins on Tuesday. =20

Christine Varney's plan is to use the first week to get the team used to =
the assignment by updating vetting reports produced in 2004. =20

I have gone through the 2004 list and have prioritized 29 of the 52 =
completed then as names that are coming up in our process as well.  (See =
Sheet #1.)  The remaining names from 2004 (Sheet #3) are names I'm =
recommending not sending to vetting now, but which we can send later as =
we see if they rise to the top of slates to be considered. =20

I have also sent the names of the Transition Board to vetting (Sheet =
#2).  (FYI, Chris Edley asked that his name not be submitted to the =
vetting process.)

Please let me know if you have any suggested additions or deletions for =
this week's assignment.  Christine's hope/expectation is that we will be =
able to produce about 30 or so reports a week.
