Dear Friend --

*This is extremely urgent and extremely important.*

U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker -- who will be overseeing a federal
court challenge to Prop 8 starting this Monday (January 11) -- is
considering whether or not to open the court room to TV cameras.

*The court just announced that it is seeking public comment on the proposal
to televise the trial -- and that all comments must be submitted to the
court by a Friday deadline.*

The interest in this case is unprecedented. And not surprisingly, supporters
of Prop 8 -- who eliminated the right of same-sex couples to marry -- do NOT
want the trial to be televised.

Opponents of Prop 8 -- led by attorneys David Boies and Ted Olson -- are
seeking to televise the case in the interests of full transparency. They
want this historic trial to be watched by as many Americans as possible.
And, of course, we agree.

*We have just this one chance to make our voices heard -- thousands of
Americans calling for equality, transparency and accountability. That's why
we're teaming up with CREDO Action to collect as many signatures as possible
asking Judge Walker to televise the case. We need your signature
now:<http://www.couragecampaign.org/page/m/4b6609e4/1ba66777/b2aea2d/40ba2baa/2159399882/VEsE/>

SIGNATURE DEADLINE: FRIDAY 9
a.m.:<http://www.couragecampaign.org/page/m/4b6609e4/1ba66777/b2aea2d/40ba2baa/2159399882/VEsF/>

http://www.couragecampaign.org/TeleviseTheTrial<http://www.couragecampaign.org/page/m/4b6609e4/1ba66777/b2aea2d/40ba2baa/2159399882/VEsC/>
*

*Together, along with our friends at CREDO, we will hand-deliver your
signatures to Judge Vaughn Walker on Friday before the deadline.*

This case presents issues that are very important to the public, and will
affect millions of people. However, if the case is not televised, only a
tiny fraction will ever be able to watch the trial in person.

By televising the trial, the public will be able to see for themselves the
arguments and evidence presented by both sides, and will therefore have more
confidence in the outcome of the trial.

*That's why we think the Prop 8 court case should be televised and we're
collecting as many signatures as possible to submit to Judge Vaughn Walker.
Click here to sign now and say "YES -- the Prop 8 trial should be
televised." SIGNATURE DEADLINE: FRIDAY 9
a.m.:<http://www.couragecampaign.org/page/m/4b6609e4/1ba66777/b2aea2d/40ba2baa/2159399882/VEsD/>

*

*If you know other people who believe the Prop 8 trial should be televised
as well, please forward this message to them ASAP. *

Thank you so much for making your voice heard at this critical time. We will
update you as soon as further news develops.

can today:*
