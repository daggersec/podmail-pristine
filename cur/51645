*July 8th Nightly Press Traffic Summary*



   - Peter Nicholas (WSJ) is doing a story for Friday on caucus organizing
   efforts and the Sanders campaign's theory that caucuses will be good for
   them in the same way that they were for Obama. We've pushed back with our
   theory of the case, including our strong organizing effort in Iowa and
   beyond.


   - Per CTR, Amy Chozick is working on story for this weekend about how
   the GOP will attack Hillary, will likely include focus group data
   suggesting that trustworthiness and being out-of-touch will be top targets.


   - Maggie Haberman is doing a write-through of her story on Hillary
   Clinton's claim that she had never been subpoenaed for tomorrow's paper
   which will include the statement we put out this afternoon.


   - Michael Scherer (TIME) is working on a story delving into the claim
   that Hillary Clinton was under no obligation to turn over 55,000 pages of
   emails.
   - Steven Holmes (CNN) is working on a piece with the premise that the
   black vote is the firewall for Hillary Clinton and Sanders is unlikely to
   make major inroads there.


   - Annie Linskey (Boston Globe) is writing for Friday about new
   fundraising hosts getting involved in this campaign, specifically females.


   - Jeremy Diamond (CNN) is doing a piece about the politics of the BDS
   movement. It will place heavy focus on the nuances and forces at play
   around Hillary Clinton's letter that was sent to presidents of major Jewish
   organizations condemning BDS.


   - Huffington Post is doing a piece on our treasurer Jose Villareal --
   will likely focus at least partially on him sitting on the Walmart board.


   - Other outstanding stories include:

o Ruby Cramer on our grassroots organizing

o Anita Kumar (McClatchy) on where we have organizers and how we've spent
our money during Q2

o Mike Memoli on our email listbuilding

o Phil Rucker on HRC talking about gun violence prevention

o Maggie Haberman/Pat Healy on the costs of Hillary's progressive proposals

o Annie Karni on the progression of our media strategy

o CNN's long-form story about Hillary Clinton/Bernie Sanders' appeal to
minority communities.
