It really didn't come off as too hot in TV - just really into it.

My biggest piece of feedback is that she was in the perfect zone.  I don't =

.  That's what matters most and so my only advice would be to stay in that =
zone...and we can't lose!

My two very minor comments:
1. Trade part needs to be tighter--but I'm not sure if she's going to need =
to do that again.  It was also her first time doing it so i assume it will =
be tighter later.
 2. The organizing ask isn't genuine to her right now--I think we could tee=
 it up better and in her words (adding Marlon for this purpose).  Perhaps s=
omething like: "I can't do this by myself.  Every American has a role to pl=
ay, taking to their friends and neighbors and encouraging them to vote.  I =
hope you will all sign up on Hillaryclinton.com<http://Hillaryclinton.com> =
and join me because this is your campaign".  Something like that. I want to=
 take knocking on doors out of it because i worry that sets too high a bar-=
-unless we have a specific ask in Iowa.
She clearly isn't comfortable with the texting ask, so I'm wondering if the=
re's a way to put it on the podium sign and take it out of the speech (FYI-=
-we got 9k mobile numbers yesterday, so it's clearly a profitable ask!).
