Editor's Note: While there are elements of the argument presented below tha=
t differ from that presented in "Embracing Israel/Palestine which you can o=
rder from www.tikkun.org/eip" (e.g. my claim that it was illegitimate for P=
alestinians to resist immigration of Jews to Palestine, consistent with my =
view that no group should be excluded from being allowed to come to any cou=
ntry while other groups are being allowed to come except on the basis of de=
monstrable lack of land or economic impossibility of that country absorbing=
 the potential immigrants, and my claim that the Palestinians' refusal to a=
llow Jews living in displaced persons' camps after the Holocaust generated =
fury at Palestinians that was not there among the Jewis yishuv/settlement i=
n the years 1945-48 and led to some horrendous treatment of Palestinians th=
ereafter), there is much that is important to absorb in the account present=
ed by Tikkun Contributing editor Mark Levine and his colleague Gil Hochberg=
 which, if really understood by Americans, Israelis and Jews around the wor=
ld, could open their hearts to a more generous and compassionate approach t=
o the fate of the Palestinian people today, a compassion which needs to be =
accompanied by a great deal of compassion for the Jewish people and the tra=
umas that we too carry in our unconscious and shapes how we understand the =
present realities in ways that keep us from being able to fully understand =
what needs to be done to make a lasting peace that would work for both side=
s of this struggle. So Please read this note to Jon Voight.--Rabbi Michael =

Dear Jon Voight,=20

=20

We write to you as admirers of your work for many years. We are also profes=
sors of modern Middle Eastern studies, specializing on the history [ http:/=
/www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/profile/mark-levine.html ] and contempor=
ary realities [ http://www.complit.ucla.edu/people/faculty/hochberg/ ] of I=
srael, Zionism and Palestine, and between the two of us have written and ed=
ited over half a dozen books on the country and the two peoples who are des=
tined-or doomed, depending on your point of view-to share it.=20

=20

We have read your open letter [ http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jon-v=
oight-pens-letter-ignorant-723007?template=3Dcap&amp;utm_expid=3D19303748-9=
5.-MaQhQt6RHyzFO0fFD96sg.1 ] to Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and other crit=
ics of the latest Israeli bombing and invasion of Gaza, in response to thei=
r own open letter condemning Israeli actions during the war. Your passion f=
or defending Israel is clearly as great as your passion for acting. However=
, behind your passion is a view of Israel's history and current actions tha=
t are utterly at odds with the actual history and present-day realities in =
the country. They are simply dead wrong, and your belief in them has led yo=
u to adopt views that will ultimately-and at this rate, sooner rather than =
later-doom, not defend Israel. Moreover, while you have laudably said that =
they or other actors should not face industry sanctions for standing up to =
Israel, we believe that intensity of your criticism, coupled with the inacc=
uracy the arguments, not only exacerbates the rewriting [ http://mondoweiss=
.net/2014/08/furiously-rewriting-conflict.html ] of the conflict's history =
in the mainstream media; it in fact contributes both to a toxic atmosphere =
of hatred [ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/joan-rivers-palestinia=
ns-deserve-to-be-dead-9656554.html ] against Palestinians, and to a purport=
ed blacklist [ http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/hollywood-studios=

=3Dc406f5dfd3ae928173b94c3496af86cd ] against them.=20

=20

Let us begin with your opening argument:=20

=20

"They are obviously ignorant of the whole story of Israel's birth, when in =
1948 the Jewish people were offered by the UN a portion of the land origina=
lly set aside for them in 1921, and the Arab Palestinians were offered the =
other half. The Arabs rejected the offer, and the Jews accepted, only to be=
 attacked by five surrounding Arab countries committed to driving them into=
 the sea. But the Israelis won. The Arabs tried it again in 1967, and again=
 in 1973, launching a sneak attack on the holiest Jewish holiday. Each time=
 the Jews prevailed but not without great loss of life. And when Israel was=
 not fighting a major war, it was defending itself against terrorist campai=
gns."=20

=20

This is the traditional narrative of Israel's birth, part of what Israeli h=
istorian Simha Flapan described as the "myths" surrounding Israel in his fa=
mous 1987 book "The Birth of Israel: Myths and Realities". However this is =
a distortion of the actual history. To begin with, when the British gained =
control over Palestine in the wake of World War I, they found a country in =
which the indigenous non-Jewish population outnumbered the still very small=
 Zionist presence by a ratio of about 9 to 1. While the typical imagination=
 of Palestine is as a backwards wasteland till Zionism and Jews "revived" i=
t, it was not empty, nor was it a "land without a people for a people witho=
ut a land." Palestine's economy was in the midst of a rapid period of devel=
opment in the late 19th century, one that was acknowledged by Zionist leade=
rs as a primary reason why they could hope to establish a foundation in the=
 country.=20

=20

Zionist immigrants tried desperately to penetrate the Palestinian Arab econ=
omy, but could not compete with the local population. Out of their desperat=
ion the concepts of the "conquest of labor" and then "conquest of land" dev=
eloped, and by 1909, the year both Tel Aviv and the first kibbutz, Degania,=
 were born, Zionism had become a "militant national movement" on the ground=
 in Palestine (in the words of Israeli sociologist Gershon Shafir in his bo=
ok "Land, Labor and the Origins of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict"), one =
whose main strategy for achieving its goals was to acquire as much territor=
y as possible in the country free of Palestinians so it could be settled by=
 Jews without fear of competition.=20

=20

It was at this point that the zero-sum conflict over territory between Jews=
 and Palestinians was born. Palestinians, like every indigenous people, rej=
ected the attempts to push them off their land-would you begrudge the Nativ=
e American's defense of their lands? Would you allow your land to be taken =
by foreigners? Would any reasonable person? In fact, the very negative trea=
tment of the indigenous population by early Zionists was recorded by Ahad H=
aam, the father of cultural Zionism and modern Jewish letters, already back=
 in 1891 in an article titled "the Truth from Palestine." He warned then th=
at if the new immigrants didn't treat the local population better, they wou=
ld be doomed to strife. Sadly, his warning has yet to be heeded. We suggest=
 you and all Israel supporters read it and consider=20

=20

Nevertheless, once the British took over, with their explicit commitment to=
 their colonial world view, the Zionist movement was given most every oppor=
tunity to develop during British rule, which lasted from 1917 through 1948.=
 The British supported Zionist institutions, and because Jews brought in la=
rge sums of outside capital in a period when the British public had turned =
against large expenses to support the colonies, the British encouraged incr=
easing Jewish immigration as a way to run Palestine without having to pay f=
or it. =C2=AD=20

=20

By the terms of the Balfour Agreement, Britain was committed to establishin=
g a "Jewish National Home" in Palestine with complete disregard of the oppo=
sition of the mass of Palestinians and later, when the British stopped most=
 Jewish land purchases during World War II to appease Arabs, the Zionist le=
adership managed to nevertheless gain even more land and consolidate it's h=
old over much of the strategic locations throughout the country with the ex=
ception of what today is the West Bank.=20

=20

When war finally came, while the Zionist leadership "accepted" the terms of=
 the 1947 Partition Plan, they had little intention of actually fulfilling =
them. From the fall of 1947 already a civil war had begun in which leaders =
of the Zionist movement began clearing out as much of the territory it cont=
rolled as possible of Palestinian inhabitants. By May 15, 1948, the date of=
 Israel's official establishment, tens of thousands of Palestinians had "al=
ready" been forced from their homes, their villages destroyed. After indepe=
ndence, the pace of expulsions-an act that was and remains completely contr=
ary to international law, then and now-increased, and ultimately led to the=
 forced exile of over 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and the complet=
e destruction of hundreds of villages. Even if one argues that Palestinians=
 willingly left their homes during the conflict, under international law of=
 the time and today they had an absolute right to return to their homes saf=
ely and securely once hostilities were at an end.=20

=20

As for your claims that Israel was attacked by surrounding countries determ=
ined to throw it into the sea, this too is belied by the historical record.=
 As Oxford University professors Avi Shlaim and Eugene Rogan demonstrated i=
n their book "The War for Palestine, Rewriting the History of 1948", none o=
f the Arab belligerents had either the hope or desire to throw the Jews int=
o the sea. They sent, for the most part, minimal forces that were badly arm=
ed and trained. Their main goals were to prevent themselves from looking li=
ke collaborators and their rival Mufti of Jerusalem from establishing a sta=
te, and where possible, to take whatever territory they could for themselve=
s. Most important here, Jordan-the one neighbor with an effective, British =
run army-had reached a modus vivendi with the Zionist/Israeli leadership in=
 which it would take over the West Bank and leave Israel the rest of the co=
untry. The only exception was Jerusalem, about which the two sides couldn't=
 agree and thus became the scene of the worst fighting of the war.=20

=20

Palestinians were completely abandoned in this conflict, as they are today,=
 not just by the west but by the Arab world as well. Their own leadership a=
nd national institutions, which had been prevented from developing by the B=
ritish for thirty years, was unable to cope with the highly sophisticated, =
well-funded, and internationally supported Zionist and then Israeli leaders=
hip-one that, even as Zionist historians like Benny Morris admit, forced ei=
ghty percent of the population into permanent exile and destroyed most of w=
hat remained to prevent their return. Gaza today is the bitter fruit of thi=
s exercise of massive ethnic cleansing: a prison filled with generations of=
 refugees whose internationally recognized right to return to their homes r=
egardless of who controlled the territory is still dismissed by Israel, eve=
n as any Jew anywhere can immediately become a citizen in this country and =
move right into the recently expropriated Palestinian land in the West Bank=
.=20

=20

This is the beginning of the conflict that still rages today. You can argue=
 that the Zionist leadership had no choice, that to allow a large Palestini=
an population to remain in Israel would doom it to permanent war. That may =
be, but it doesn't change the reality. The Zionist movement was not an inno=
cent victim of Arab fanaticism and antipathy to Jews. It was an active part=
icipant and initiator of an intercommunal conflict which resulted in the ex=
pulsion of a million Palestinians in 1948 and then 1967, and which has prod=
uced a brutal and illegal occupation that continues and even intensifies to=
 this day. Do you think this is fair, Mr. Voight?=20

=20

Let's leave aside that you don't mention the 1956 tripartite invasion by Is=
rael, France and the UK on Egypt, which not even Israelis argue was a defen=
sive war. Similar to your description of 1948, your description of 1967 as =
the "Arab trying again" to destroy Israel is historically inaccurate. There=
 was certainly many threats emanating from Arab capitals in the late spring=
 of 1967, but ultimately it was Israel that clearly launched a "sneak attac=
k," not the Arab states. Not only that, while the traditional narrative whi=
ch you no doubt believe holds that Israel risked annihilation in 1967 and t=
herefore had no choice by the launch a preemptive attack, in reality Israel=
i leaders, and their American counterparts, knew full well that the balance=
 of power was highly skewed towards Israel. The CIA even predicted that Isr=
ael could wipe out the combined forces of the surrounding states in roughly=
 five days, exactly what happened.=20

=20

While presented to the world as a war of survival, 1967 was in fact a war o=
f conquest and expansion. How do we know this? Quite simply because that's =
just what Israel did-it conquered and occupied the West Bank, Gaza, Sinai a=
nd the Golan Heights and, against the stern advice of a then ailing David B=
en Gurion, who advocated returning the territories as soon as possible, pro=
ceeded to settle them intensively, particularly in the Biblical heartland o=
f the West Bank.=20

=20

Here, Mr. Voight, it is absolutely crucial to understand that if Israel was=
 afraid to turn over the West Bank to Palestinians for security reasons-tha=
t is, if the occupation were in fact about security-it could have maintaine=
d a military occupation to this day without violating international law. Bu=
t instead it began a settlement enterprise that came to dominate Israeli po=
litical life, eventually placing well over half a million settlers in the W=
est Bank and East Jerusalem, in clear contravention of international law, w=
hich expressly forbids transferring civilians from one country into an occu=
pied territory.=20

=20

Indeed, Israel today could withdraw civilian settlers from the West Bank at=
 any moment and bring itself into compliance with international law, while =
continuing to occupy the West Bank militarily indefinitely. But of course i=
t will never do that. In fact, as Israeli scholars Meron Benvenisti already=
 argued back in 1987 with his "West Bank Data Base Project", when there wer=
e only about 60,000 settlers (one tenth of the present number), by this tim=
e the West Bank was already so integrated into Israel that it would never b=
e possible to withdraw from it.=20

=20

In other words, the peace process and the land-for-peace formula on which i=
t was based, was already impossible to implement half a decade before it of=
ficially commenced. And since its commencement in 1993, the number of settl=
ers has exploded and Israeli control over the territories entrenched even f=
urther. How can you square that with a country that wants to make peace wit=
h its neighbors?=20

=20

Mr. Voight, have you ever visited the Palestinian West Bank or Gaza, or spo=
ken with Palestinians who've suffered under decades of Israeli occupation? =
Had you been forced to suffer their fate, your anger would certainly be dir=
ected elsewhere. During the last five decades Palestinians have suffered co=
ntinuous expropriation of their lands, collective punishment, destruction o=
f their homes, seizures of their agricultural land and destruction of their=
 trees and crops, extrajudicial executions, exile, kidnapping, torture, use=
 of human shields, economic blockade and closure, constant invasions and bo=
mbing, denial of the right to education or development, massive exploitatio=
n and then closure. The list of violations of international law perpetrated=
 by the Israeli government is pages long, and this doesn't include Lebanon,=
 which Israel illegally invaded in 1978 and then 1982, launching a 19-year =
occupation that resulted in similar levels of human rights violations.=20

=20

This is not a political accusation, it is a statement of legal fact. Do you=
 think Israel, which has received hundreds of billions of US tax dollars, s=
hould be able to behave like this with impunity? Human Rights Watch has jus=
t released a report [ http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/08/04/gaza-israeli-soldi=
ers-shoot-and-kill-fleeing-civilians ] based on survivors' testimonies demo=
nstrating that Israel shot and bombed fleeing civilians during hostilities,=
 in complete contravention of international law. This is not new, you shoul=
d know. Israel engaged in similar attacks on fleeing civilians during the 2=
008-09 [ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/09/btselem-civilians-majorit=
_n_280217.html ] war with Gaza, and has in fact killed thousands of Palesti=
nians in this manner. Where is the justice in that? How do such actions mak=
e Israel or America safer, more free or more secure?=20

=20

Sadly, if you move away from the decades of Israeli propaganda to the actua=
l history, it becomes impossible to argue, as you do in your letter that "I=
srael has always labored for a peaceful relation with its Arab neighbors." =
It is true that Israel returned Sinai as part of a peace deal with Egypt. B=
ut what most people, including apparently you, don't realize or remember is=
 that the large majority of the Camp David Agreement was centered around Is=
raeli commitments to enable "full autonomy to the inhabitants" as soon as p=
ossible, which required "the Israeli military government and its civilian a=
dministration [to] be withdrawn as soon as a self-governing authority has b=
een established." Israel broke this promise as soon as the agreement was si=
gned. Instead of moving towards supporting full autonomy through local elec=
tions and a robust negotiating process with Egypt, Jordan and the Palestini=
ans, the Israeli government went on a building spree that cemented its perm=
anent control over the West Bank.=20

=20

Similarly today, Israel did not "give the Palestinians all of Gaza as a pea=
ce gesture." To begin with, Gaza was never a gift Israel could "give" to Pa=
lestinians. It was not only occupied under international law but legally in=
separable from the West Bank. Israel could merely withdraw and then impose =
a blockade, while at the same time intensifying once again its settlements =
in and control over the West Bank. But that is precisely what then Prime Mi=
nister Ariel Sharon did-his goal, according to his then Bureau Chief Dov We=
isglass, was specifically to place the peace process into "formaldehyde [ h=
ttp://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/top-pm-aide-gaza-plan-aims-to-free=
ze-the-peace-process-1.136686 ]" and "freeze" it while Israel's hold over t=
he West Bank was made permanent,* *and there has been no major shift in Isr=
aeli policy since then. Mr. Voight, do these policies seem "peaceful" to yo=
u?=20

=20

This is the context to understand why Palestinian elected Hamas in 2006. As=
 even the arch-conservative New York Post admitted [ http://nypost.com/2006=
/01/27/the-hamas-victory-kicking-out-corruption/ ] that Hamas was elected n=
ot because of its terrorism but out of complete disgust [ http://www.thegua=
rdian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine =
] with the Palestinian Authority, controlled by Yasser Arafat's Fatah party=
, which was utterly coopted by and dependent upon Israel and the US, had be=
come hugely corrupt, and as brutal as Israel in its treatment of dissent. A=
fter a decade and a half of such governance, Hamas won by portraying itself=
 as better able to resist ongoing Israeli settlement and government efficie=
ntly and without corruption. More to the point, Hamas did not begin firing =
missiles into Israel until after it attempted to remove the newly elected l=
eadership by force in a US and PA-supported coup [ http://www.vanityfair.co=
m/politics/features/2008/04/gaza200804 ]. No significant rocket fire occurr=
ed until two years after Hamas was elected, during which time Israel contin=
ued its siege on Gaza and ever-tightening stranglehold on the West Bank.=20

=20

To be sure, Hamas has failed on every possible measure of governance or eth=
ical behavior, to the point where even Palestinians are calling [ http://ww=
w.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4557777,00.html ] for its removal from any=
 level of power. Moreover, its indiscriminate attacks on civilians are unju=
stifiable war crimes, which deserve the condemnation of the world and prose=
cution and punishment (it's treatment of Gazans who oppose it has been litt=
le better). But if Hamas deserves such treatment, what do Israel's leaders,=
 guilty of far greater crimes, deserve? If we were to hold Hamas and Israel=
 to the same standards, what would you feel that Israeli leaders should rec=
eive for their treatment of Palestinians for half a century?=20

=20

Again, your characterization of Israel as having been engaged in "years of =
trying to make peace" is simply and completely false. There has been no att=
empt by any Israeli government to make any peace to which any reasonable pe=
rson could be expected to agree-that is, one that would enable the creation=
 of a territorially and economically viable Palestinian state. Nor are Isra=
elis still "attacked by their enemies." Israel in fact is at peace with Egy=
pt and Jordan, and has not been threatened by Syria or any other surroundin=
g state for decades, and is fully capable of defending itself against any e=
xternal aggression, including by Hezbollah. To talk about Israel as always =
the "retaliator" is equally false, its nearly two-decade long occupation of=
 southern Lebanon the most obvious rebuttal to any such claim.=20

=20

With respect to the present conflict, you are incorrect to say that Javier =
Bardem and other critics "have forgotten how this war started. Did Hamas no=
t kidnap and kill three young teenagers for the sake of killing, and celebr=
ated after the killing? What a travesty of justice." Indeed, this is not wh=
at happened. Rather, as reported* *in great detail in the Israeli media  [ =
http://mondoweiss.net/2014/07/killed-turning-onslaught.html ]itself, the Is=
raeli government began an series of attacks [ http://electronicintifada.net=
/content/netanyahu-government-knew-teens-were-dead-it-whipped-racist-frenzy=
/13533 ] on Hamas and other Palestinian activists, arresting, shooting and =
even killing many in response to a unity deal struck between Hamas and the =
Palestinian Authority in preparation for resumed negotiations.=20

=20

Your description of what Israelis have faced is, tragically, far more accur=
ate about what Palestinians face daily for decades-indiscriminate and unlaw=
ful attacks by Israeli forces and routine violations of their most basic hu=
man rights and international law. Again, this is not a political accusation=
; it is a statement of legal fact, as a visit to the website of any Israeli=
 or international human rights organizations, or even the State Department =
[ http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?dynamic_=
load_id=3D220358&amp;year=3D2013#wrapper ]'s own Human Rights reviews attes=
t to in great detail. (We would suggest you visit the website of the Israel=
i human rights organization B'tselem [ http://www.btselem.org/ ], but it wa=
s repeatedly hacked since the beginning of the war on Gaza by right wing Is=
raelis who oppose reporting of the truth from the Occupied Territories.)=20

=20

Mr. Voight, there is no way to describe what Israel has done in Gaza other =
than as a massive crime against humanity. Is it genocide, as the letter Mr.=
 Bardem and others signed alleges? Given the history of genocide against th=
e Jews-the very term was invented to describe the Holocaust-it is tragic th=
at such a characterization can even be considered [ http://uprootedpalestin=
ians.blogspot.com/2014/08/genocide-becomes-mainstream-in-israeli.html ]. Bu=
t in fact it must be faced, because Israel's actions [ http://electronicint=
ifada.net/content/when-israeli-denial-palestinian-existence-becomes-genocid=
al/12388 ], which have long been characterized as "politicide" or "spacioci=
de" by Israeli and Palestinian scholars such as Baruch Kimmerling and Sari =
Hanafi, have become so intense [ http://jonathanturley.org/2014/07/17/they-=
have-to-die-israeli-politicians-comments-calling-for-killing-of-mothers-of-=
palestinians-trigger-international-backlash/ ] that one can no longer take =
such an accusation off the table.=20

=20

It is undeniable that Israelis have suffered in this present conflict and t=
he past that led us here, but what is certain is that the suffering Israel =
it has inflicted upon Palestinians is exponentially greater, and the respon=
sibility for that suffering lies not just with Israel, but with the United =
States which has, in the words of Jon Stewart, acted as its "drug dealer [ =
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DGcngu9wkCzE ]" while pretending to be a c=
aring friend. If you really care about Israel, you will take the time to un=
derstand the actual history and present realities, not myths that have no m=
ore accuracy than the wild-west fantasies that used to be taught to school =
children in the United States. Otherwise, all your passion and concern for =
Israel will only lead it closer to the very reckoning you desperately tryin=
g to avoid.=20

hat the Palestinians' refusal to allow Jews living in displaced persons' ca=
mps after the Holocaust generated fury at Palestinians that was not there a=
mong the Jewis yishuv/settlement in the years 1945-48 and led to some horre=
ndous treatment of Palestinians thereafter), there is much that is importan=
t to absorb in the account presented by Tikkun Contributing editor Mark Lev=
ine and his colleague Gil Hochberg which, if really understood by Americans=
, Israelis and Jews around the world, could open their hearts to a more gen=
erous and compassionate approach to the fate of the Palestinian people toda=

 for the Jewish people and the traumas that we too carry in our unconscious=

 state, and where possible, to take whatever territory they could for thems=
elves. Most important here, Jordan&mdash;the one neighbor with an effective=
, British run army&mdash;had reached a modus vivendi with the Zionist/Israe=
li leadership in which it would take over the West Bank and leave Israel th=

ip&mdash;one that, even as Zionist historians like Benny Morris admit, forc=
ed eighty percent of the population into permanent exile and destroyed most=
 of what remained to prevent their return. Gaza today is the bitter fruit o=
f this exercise of massive ethnic cleansing: a prison filled with generatio=

that the Zionist leadership had no choice, that to allow a large Palestinia=

ent victim of Arab fanaticism and antipathy to Jews. It was an active parti=

ulsion of a million Palestinians in 1948 and then 1967, and which has produ=
