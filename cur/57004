 It's lonely at the top, especially when you're an unpopular president.

When President Bush speaks in Las Vegas on Thursday, he will not be joined
by any of Nevada's members of Congress.

He has visited Nevada nine times as president and on all but one of those
occasions he was either greeted or escorted by at least one member of the
Nevada delegation. The exception occurred during a two-hour campaign stop i=
n
Las Vegas in 2004, when the president was bouncing among states on his
reelection bid.

On the heels of his final State of the Union address, Bush will be here
Thursday to speak about the global war on terrorism. He will also appear at
a fundraiser for the Nevada Republican Party.

Among the Republicans not sharing the stage with him: Rep. Jon Porter, who
said he is committed to appointments in Washington. He didn't elaborate.

Spokesman Matt Leffingwell said Porter received an invitation from the Whit=
e
House on Thursday, asking him to greet Bush at McCarran International
Airport and attend the president's speech. But by that time, Leffingwell
said, the congressman's schedule was full of afternoon meetings with
out-of-town visitors in Washington.

As for John Ensign: Yes, the senator also received an invitation, but the
Senate is in session, said spokesman Tory Mazzola.

The Senate is considering extending the surveillance law Congress hastily
adopted in August when the White House warned of dangerous gaps in its
surveillance authority. But Democrats and Republicans have been at
loggerheads over new legislation that would give retroactive legal immunity
to telecommunications companies that allowed the government to wiretap thei=
r
customers without court permission.

The surveillance law expires Friday, and Mazzola said Ensign would be busy
pushing for the White House-favored update to the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act. (Indeed, Bush plans to push for the law in his speech her=
e
Thursday, according to an Associated Press report.)

Rep. Dean Heller's Washington spokesman did not return repeated calls
regarding the congressman's schedule.

Bush's previous visit to Nevada came in August, when he spoke to veterans a=
t
the American Legion's National Convention in Reno. There, during his fourth
trip to that city, he was accompanied by Heller and his wife, Lynn, who san=
g
the national anthem before the event. The president visited Nevada three
times in 2006, twice on behalf of Heller, who was seeking to succeed Jim
Gibbons to represent Nevada's 2nd District, and once for Porter.

The presidential visits provide Congress members and local officials the
rare opportunity to promote state issues with a direct line to the White
House. For instance, during Bush's first visit to Nevada in 2003, both
Gibbons and Porter, along with Gov. Kenny Guinn and his wife, Dema, rode in
the president's limo. Porter, for one, pushed the state's opposition to
Yucca Mountain, a project the president supports.

Still, Porter now faces a potentially tough reelection fight in November,
and Bush's abysmal approval ratings, combined with Porter's swing district,
likely make Washington's climate more appealing =97 at least on Thursday.
