*Why do you think that the disclosure of UFO related documents is
important?*



Throughout my career, from my work on the staff of the Senate Judiciary
Committee to the White House, I have been a strong advocate for government
openness and transparency.  When I was White House Chief of Staff I led the
effort to declassify over 800 million pages of historically valuable
previously classified documents. Disclosure of files related to
unidentified aerial phenomena is completely consistent with the goal of a
transparent and open government. It might also be good material for future
X-files plots.

*It seems like a lot of UFO documents would contain sensitive military
information =E2=80=93 how would you go about getting these released?*



The government has processes in place for redacting material that should
remain classified, even if it=E2=80=99s decades old. I=E2=80=99m confident =
that it can be
handled appropriately.



*Do you think if Hillary is elected she would make good on her promise to
get to the bottom of this UFO business? Why?*



She promised me she would!

*Other than Hillary, are there any other alien-friendly candidates in the
running? If not, why do you think this is?*



Notwithstanding the fact that serious scientists, military leaders,
business people, and average citizens are interested in the subject of
intelligent life in the universe, political leaders tend to worry about
whether they will be lampooned if they broach the subject. I, on the other
hand, am interested in just making the UNIVERSE GREAT AGAIN.



*What makes you think there is information on UFO and extraterrestrials
that the government is not sharing with the people? What would the motive
be for this?/If it turned out that there was information being withheld,
how do you think people would react to it? Are we ready to hear this?
Why/why not?*



Look, I believe that the government, in the name of transparency and
openness should declassify and release information in regards to
unidentified aerial phenomena. Obviously, there have been decades of
speculation about what, if anything, is contained in these files, and I=E2=
=80=99m
confident that the American people can handle the truth.
