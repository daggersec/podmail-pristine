Roger that.  I had three quick items on my end when you have a sec today:
1. I wanted to send out an email organizing the research call--I assume
we're still good to circulate the docs Monday?
2. Is Ian clear to start making rsch offers?  We wanted to move on that
tomorrow too.
3. Any chance she pulled the trigger on a lawyer yesterday?
