I didn't think she was too hot. On tv she looked passionate and engaged.
Plus she looked like she was having fun. I watched some of it with the
sound off and the performance was great. She was smiling, looked totally at
ease and was not looking down too much so she seemed connected to the
audience. It really didn't come off as too hot in TV - just really into it.

My biggest piece of feedback is that she was in the perfect zone.  I don't
have comments on the text (except tiny things below).  To me, what's
important and what matters right now is staying in that same zone--she was
passionate, but not too hot.  She was personal.  She was having fun and
looked like she really wanted to be there and wanted to bring them into her
campaign.  That's what matters most and so my only advice would be to stay
in that zone...and we can't lose!

My two very minor comments:
1. Trade part needs to be tighter--but I'm not sure if she's going to need
to do that again.  It was also her first time doing it so i assume it will
be tighter later.
 2. The organizing ask isn't genuine to her right now--I think we could tee
it up better and in her words (adding Marlon for this purpose).  Perhaps
something like: "I can't do this by myself.  Every American has a role to
play, taking to their friends and neighbors and encouraging them to vote.
I hope you will all sign up on Hillaryclinton.com and join me because this
is your campaign".  Something like that. I want to take knocking on doors
out of it because i worry that sets too high a bar--unless we have a
specific ask in Iowa.
She clearly isn't comfortable with the texting ask, so I'm wondering if
there's a way to put it on the podium sign and take it out of the speech
(FYI--we got 9k mobile numbers yesterday, so it's clearly a profitable
ask!).
