Thanks Ron. On Glass Steagall, that's what a stronger Volcker Rule does
which is what she is for, but what about requiring banks to downsize?

I agree with you on TPP but others (including on this email!) feel strongly
to the contrary.

Jake,

I had to get off that call before it ended, and I also didn't want to
intrude in that group.  But FWIW, my view would be:

1. * She has to be for TPP*.  She called it the "gold standard" of trade
agreements.  I think opposing that would be a huge flip flop.  She can say
that as President she would work to change it.  She can say that it can be
better.   But I think she should support it.

2.  *She should move 95% to Warren on Glass Steagall.*   I think you can
avoid the flip flop, but survive the Warren primary by saying:

"Of course I wouldn't bring back Glass Steagall -- that's a law written 80
years ago before we had anything like the current banking system.  But I
agree with Sen. Warren that -- given the ongoing misconduct in the banking
industry -- we need to erect a wall between banking and non-banking
activities.  If I became President, I would sit down with her and develop a
21st century version of Glass Steagall that provides sound separation
between basic banking and riskier activities, but still keeps America's
financial institution's competitive."

Just my view, FWIW.

Ron
