ARLINGTON, VA: McCain Press Avail 06/16/08

Speech Highlights

   - Americans are hurting
   - *Tomorrow i'll call for lifting federal moratorium on states for
   off-shore oil exploration. *This is a short-term measure toward the
   long-term goal of reducing dependence on foreign oil and reducing greenhouse
   gas emissions
   - I repeat my advocacy for gas tax holiday
   - I have called repeatedly now for town hall meetings- if we want to
   change the way things are done in Washington. I hope Obama will reconsider
   my invitation. *Both of us have accepted invitations to La Raza - we
   should have a town hall meeting together there. People will be informed and
   in some cases entertained*.
   - Yesterday i met with the iraqi foreign minister. i've known him for
   more than a decade. he's a fine representative. there's no doubt in either
   of our minds that the surge is succeeding.  obama was wrong when he said the
   surge wouldn't succeed, he was wrong when he said we were failing in Iraq
   because of it and he's wrong today.
   - Troops should come home with honor and victory, Obama's withdrawal plan
   will lead to chaos and genocide.
   - Success is evident in Iraq
   - I urge Obama to go to Iraq and to meet with Gen Petraeus

Press Avail

   - 1 Q) [JILL] why should Reagan Dems vote for you?
      - MCCAIN: They can be assured of a safe and prosperous nation.  I have
      stark differences with Obama: taxes, Iraq*. I won't tell small-town
      America that they are bitter.* I know why they embrace their
      Constitutional rights and they embrace their religion.


   - 2 Q) GOP fillibuster on extension of tax credits for renewable energy.
   What are you doing to move your party on this?
      - MCCAIN: I'm doing everything i can to . I voted against the Bush
      energy bill, Obama voted for it. I'm proud of the many GOPs that are
      supporting this cause. There are many Dems that are blocking this
      legislation as well. As Pres, I will unite Dems and GOPs on
this. I have a
      long record on this, e.g. the first cap-and-trade proposal.


   - 3 Q) [DANA BASH] Given the fact that Clayton Williams 1990 'rape' quote
   was widely known, how did you have this fundraiser planned? Will you give
   the money back that he helped raise? Will this hurt you with women?
      - MCCAIN: *My people weren't aware of those comments *he made years
      ago. The people that contributed are supporters of mine and not
his. We'll
      do it somewhere else and he's not attending.


   - 4 Q) How important is "swing state" of VA?
      - MCCAIN: VA is a rapidly changing state, rapid growth and I'll be
      campaigning a lot here. I'll be mentioned that I was once stationed here
      with the Navy.


   - 5 Q) Why did you open your VA Victory office in the Tidewater area?
      - MCCAIN: We'll have openings everywhere in the state. We'll have a
      strong presence in Tidewater area, there's a strong military
presence. We've
      gotta get support


   - Comment- I recognize people when they raise their hand.


   - 6 Q) Is this lifting of the off-shore exploration moratoria a change in
   your policy and how far off shore?
      - MCCAIN: I'm not dictating to states that they drill, but I think the
      moratoria should be lifted and I want to perhaps provide incentives to
      explore.


   - 7 Q) Did you take offense when Allen said 'macaca'?
      - MCCAIN: I thought it was wrong. I urged him to apologize for it very
      quickly.


   - follow-up: Women have problem with your, as Harry Reid termed, "anger
   management" issues - the Senate is a civil place, not a place of passionate
   outbursts.
      - MCCAIN: My record of working across the aisle is top-of-the-line. In
      order to do that, you have to have serious and fruitful discussions. Do I
      get angry sometimes? Americans are angry. I was not elected 'Miss
      Congeniality' because I said we have to stop wasteful spending. Do I get
      angry when I uncover a guy like Abramoff? I've had hundreds of town hall
      meetings and Americans are angry too.


   - 8 Q) Process question - Some experts are saying that GOPs and you are
   behind on Internet. How would you use town hall meetings as President?
      - MCCAIN: I agree - we have a great challenge in this campaign - the
      economy and the challenges we face are significant. I know I have to
      out-campaign my opponent. I consider myself an underdog. We have a lot of
      work to do in energizing grassroots. Town hall meetings are
important. The
      kind of town hall meetings we had yesterday  - through the miracle of
      telecommunications, we can reach thousands and tens of thousands
of people
      through the Internet. I congratulate Obama for using it well. As
the father
      of young people ranging from 16 to 23, I understand from them how vital a
      role Internet plays.


   - 9 Q) [Carl Cameron] The lifting of the moratoria comes at a time when a
   lot of GOPs are saying we have to drill in ANWR. To what extent is the
   lifting of the moratoria addressing that? And how do you persuade GOPs that
   you are not in their face of what they think is an important part of the
   domestic energy plan?
      - MCCAIN: I try not to get in their face. I believe ANWR is a pristine
      area, but I also believe lifting the moratoria is something we
should place
      as a very high priority. I do believe there are places in the world we
      shouldn't drill, but I think we should be open to drill there.


   - 10 Q) Would you consider mandatory targets on renewable energy, like
   the EU has done? Any plans to go to Colombia to draw contrast with Obama on
   trade?
      - MCCAIN: I believe in the cap and trade system - I wouldn't make it
      mandatory at this time. But we need targets to reach. Through innovation,
      green technologies will achieve that.
      - MCCAIN: We are looking to travel, but not to make it a campaign
      ploy. If I go to Canada or Colombia, it'll be to thank them. I know these
      leaders and i know the issues. Obama said he would unilaterally
renegotiate
      NAFTA, I think we need to reeducate and train the workers to take care of
      them.


   - 11 Q) *Status of forces -* *What happens if the Iraqi government asks
   us to leave?*
      - *MCCAIN: They won't.* I don't engage in hypotheticals that aren't
      going to happen. We are engaged in talks right now. We'll have an
      arrangement that suits both interests of US and Iraq. We are winning,
      tactically and strategically, and we will be able to withdraw
over time with
      victory and honor.
   - Follow-up
      - MCAIN: The Iraqis don't seek that. Yesterday foreign minister said
      we want the withdrawal to be dictated by the situation on the
ground. Obama
      is and was wrong on Iraq. I am confident that the foreign
minister will tell
      Obama the same thing - that we are succeeding.


   - AIDE: we're out of time. MCCAIN: just a few more.


   - 12 Q) The Senators refusing to endorse you - is that indicative of
   problems?
      - Polls show that we have the same percentage of GOPs supporting us as
      Bush did. We have a lot of work to do. I'm happy with the degree of unity
      that our party has. I'm confident with the substantial progress we're
      making, especially since we had such a spirited campaign. It
helps that the
      primary contenders are with me (takes a long time to come up
with Romney's
      name)


   - 13 Q) CA gay marriage today. Will that play an issue in the campaign?
      - MCCAIN: I voted for FMA, I will continue with my position that
      marriage should be unique between man and woman. I also feel the
people of
      CA will make their decision. I maintain my position.

12 Q) The Senators refusing to endorse you - is that indicative of problems?</li><ul><li>Polls
show that we have the same percentage of GOPs supporting us as Bush
did. We have a lot of work to do. I&#39;m happy with the degree of unity
that our party has. I&#39;m confident with the substantial progress we&#39;re
making, especially since we had such a spirited campaign. It helps that
the primary contenders are with me (takes a long time to come up with
Romney&#39;s name)</li></ul></ul></div><div style=""><ul><li>13 Q) CA gay marriage today. Will that play an issue in the campaign?</li><ul><li>MCCAIN:
I voted for FMA, I will continue with my position that marriage should

their decision. I maintain my position.</li></ul></ul></div></div></div><br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Sara DuBois<br>Deputy Director - Tracking/Media Monitoring<br>Progressive Media USA<br><a href="mailto:sdubois@progressivemediausa.org">sdubois@progressivemediausa.org</a><br>
