John --

Yesterday, the President announced the framework of a bipartisan agreement =
to extend a set of tax cuts that were set to expire, restore unemployment =
benefits for millions of Americans, and pass additional measures to help =
middle-class families and create jobs.

Now, he's recorded a video to speak directly to OFA supporters about the =
deal. Watch it here -- and leave a note with your thoughts:

http://my.barackobama.com/TaxCutsVideo5

This agreement, while not perfect, is vital to millions of Americans who =
are out of work through no fault of their own -- as well as millions of =
middle-class families, students, parents, and small businesses.

Take a minute to watch his message -- and then let us know what you think:

Thanks,

Mitch

P.S. -- The President will be talking with OFA supporters live tomorrow at =
6:00 p.m. Eastern Time -- sign up here for a reminder and instructions on =
how to listen in to the call:
