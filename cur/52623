Hi John (and Hi Eryn!)

I hope this finds you well. I am so glad to see you in the trenches for HRC.

I recently learned that I'm a finalist to become a Fellow at New America,
which funds bold thinkers and writers. I submitted a proposal for a book I
want to write on social discounting, short-term metrics, and long-term
thinking in the era of big data. (Working title: The Gambler's Telescope.)

The finalist field this year is fiercely competitive. The team at New
America just told me that they would like to call references for me next
week.

I would be deeply grateful if you were willing to support me.  If you'd
like to get a sense of what I'm pursuing, here's a recent think piece I
wrote that hits one angle of the book:
https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/05/16/the-race-preserve-disappearing-data/0KPHAx5iK6jaLIvWQqIl4O/story.html

The book will span many topics beyond this, including climate change,
antibiotic resistance, the management of tech companies and NBA teams like
the Spurs vs. the Bulls.

Would it be OK to give them your name and if so, a good number to reach you?

Thank you for considering this amid your many commitments to making the
world better. I hope to reconnect with both of you in person soon.

Warm regards,
Bina
