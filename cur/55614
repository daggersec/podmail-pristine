<div>Hello John,</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I am sending the first cut at our 5-year budget, staffing plan, and bu=
dget narrative. There are directions below for Eryn to print easily. Next w=
eek, before we meet on Friday, we intend to also send you (1) an updated =

<div>Elisabeth and I had a good talk with Ira Fishman today. He agreed to s=

is already on two boards and wants to make sure he has the time. I really h=
ope he says yes as he=E2=80=99s the right person
 =E2=80=94 maybe a ping from you would help? I am sending him everything I=
=E2=80=99m sending to you today and we wondered if you thought it would mak=

 planning our next steps. Please let me know.</div>
