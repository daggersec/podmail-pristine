So the reality is that pickings are slim on this. There aren't many people
who are prominent + Hispanic + techie + young, so you sort of have to be
willing to relax your standards on at least one of those attributes. A few
additional ideas...

- Pablo Fuentes (http://www.proven.com/pages/aboutUs) - would be a good
storyline and right on message: jobs, small/medium-sized businesses, etc.
- Andres Moreno (http://www.openenglish.com/en/corporate/meet-our-team/?) -
also a good, if more complicated, story; founded the largest online school
for English language class
- Roy Sosa (http://www.weforum.org/young-global-leaders/roy-sosa) -
ex-Marine, sold a financial services business that catered to lower-class
families
- Lin Manuel Miranda (composer of In the Heights and that Hamilton musical
that everyone loves...)
- Alexander Torrenegra (http://torrenegra.com/about) - relatively prominent
Hispanic (/immigrant) entrepreneur
- Maria Teresa Kumar (CEO of Voto Latino)
- Cristina Saralegui

There's obviously plenty of other successful Hispanic businesspeople, but
not a lot who are exceptionally distinguished or whose bio tells any
particular story. It's possible we missed some good options, but I worked
with two people on this who live and breathe Hispanic culture - I tend to
doubt we overlooked anyone super-awesome.

Another idea, that I personally think would be more fruitful, would be to
pick a Hispanic co-chair who isn't necessarily
young/techie/entrepreneurial, and then, separately, pick a fourth co-chair
who's more in the young/techie/entrepreneurial mode - that would give us a
bit more freedom to maneuver on this.
