This is not my area at all. So people should weight Schmidt and Pyles and
Gary's views much, much more strongly.

But my understanding is that Biden is somewhat weaker with liberals on
financial reform issues. If we are worried about him entering, and drawing
liberals either from us or Sanders because he's in theory more electable,
I'd lean toward going stronger on financial accountability to the extent we
can in a way that does not seem like a lurch but an evolution of the
principles we've put out and the lessons of the crisis.
