We'll have our usual board and staff call on Friday morning at 9:30 a.m. =
 The call shouldn't last more than an hour.  Here's the call-in number:
=20
Conference Dial-in Number: (712) 432-0600
Participant Access Code: 560778#
=20
Also, I forgot to circulate last week's memo to Obama/Biden.  I've =
attached it below.

Weekly Transition Memo for Senators Obama and Biden

=20

From:    Transition Advisory Board and Staff

Date:     October 12, 2008

=20

Last week, the transition board, staff, and working group chairs met =
again in D.C. for five hours.  We will continue weekly calls and =
meetings until Election Day.

=20

I.          Structure of Transition

=20

We have mapped out a draft organizational structure for the transition, =
as well as a process for moving information from the pre-Election Day =
transition team to the incoming Administration nominees.  The =
organizational structure is a dynamic one that meshes the existing =
resources of the campaign (e.g., communications, congressional liaison, =
policy) with the expertise that has been developed on the transition =
team.  The goal is to come up with a structure that initially gives =
authority over more functions to the transition advisory board and =
transition director, and then gradually shifts this authority to the =
White House chief of staff and other nominees as they are named.  If =
possible, we would like to schedule 45 minutes or so with both of you to =
brief you on our plans. =20

=20

II.        Policy Groups

=20

At our D.C. meeting, each of the policy working groups was asked to =
provide a list of possible action items (e.g., meetings, press events, =
speeches) that might be taken in November after Election Day.  =
Obviously, the most notable actions in each of these areas will be the =
announcement of nominations.  Here is a summary of some of the other =
items discussed:

=20

National Security - The national security group has laid out a detailed, =
week-by-week plan of action items, such as intelligence and military =
briefings, contacts with foreign leaders, outreach to congressional =
leaders, and discussions of possible early executive orders that should =
be signed after the inauguration.

            =20

Economy - Given the rapidly evolving economic crisis in this country, we =
are working to develop a strong staffing structure to assist with =
post-Election Day crisis management, further refine your economic plan, =
and determine how and when to engage the Bush Administration on economic =
policy.  This Friday, the economic working group is meeting with a group =
of senior advisors such as Paul Volcker and Robert Rubin to discuss =
these issues.  One early decision will be whether to hold an economic =
summit.

=20

Energy - Some of the early questions that will confront us are:  does =
energy get wrapped into the broader discussion of the economy and a =
stimulus package; do energy nominations get rolled out with economic =
nominations; how do we want to participate in the next round of climate =
change negotiations scheduled for December in Poland; how do we want to =
use EPA's authority to address climate change; what executive orders do =
we want to sign in January; and what meetings do we want to schedule to =
demonstrate an inclusive, bipartisan approach to addressing climate =
change.

=20

Health - In November, we will need to engage congressional leadership on =
how to approach health care reform legislation.  Other actions that =
could be taken early are convening a town hall meeting on the subject, =
and hosting an economic summit that ties health reform to economic =
reform.

=20

Education - Some of the possible early action items include:  announcing =
the formation of the President's Early Learning Council; including =
education funding in a stimulus package; and making decisions about =
upcoming legislation like the reauthorization of No Child Left Behind =
and the proposed $4,000 college tax credit.

=20

Immigration - Perhaps, the most important early action is to get a sense =
from congressional leadership as to how hard to push immigration reform =
in the first year.  Even in the absence of legislation, there are =
important signals that can be sent by issuing executive actions or =
scheduling an early meeting with the president of Mexico.  The =
immigration working group is collaborating with Gov. Napolitano on these =
issues.

=20

Technology, Innovation, and Government Reform - The transition website =
is set to go live on the morning of November 5 and will be the first =
opportunity to highlight the President-elect's commitment to running an =
open and transparent government.  The website eventually will allow the =
public to submit resumes, tell their stories, offer policy suggestions, =
and participate in electronic town halls with nominees.  We will also =
need to develop a "new media" approach for every major transition event.

=20

III.       Communications Strategy

=20

Our communications team is headed by Laura Nichols (former Gephardt =
communications director and now at CAP) and Sarah Feinberg =
(communications director for the House Democratic Caucus).  They are =
working to coordinate the action plans of each of the policy groups and =
devise a communications strategy for the transition and the first 100 =
days in office that also reflects the change from campaign mode to =
governing mode.  The communications team is closely coordinating its =
efforts with Anita Dunn and Dan Pfeiffer.

=20

III.       Press Stories on the Transition

=20

This week, Huffington Post posted a blog that gave some details about =
our transition planning efforts, including the fact that we have working =
groups split up by agencies and that we have asked transition =
participants to sign a code of conduct.  We have advised our team once =
again to take steps to protect the confidentiality of our planning =
process. =20

=20

Also this week, there have been press accounts of an executive order =
that President Bush has signed to establish a transition coordinating =
council for the Administration.  This is similar to executive orders =
that have been signed by other presidents.
