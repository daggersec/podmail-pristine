*Reviews Are In: Hillary Clinton Well Received Making Her Case In Iowa*



Hillary Clinton hit the trail for the first time in this campaign, making
stops in small venues across Iowa, including at a coffee shop in Le Claire
and a community college in Monticello. The events gave her an opportunity
to listen to the concerns of everyday Iowans, share ideas to tackle today=
=E2=80=99s
problems and demonstrate her commitment to earning their votes. Even Iowa
Governor Terry Branstad (R) endorsed the campaign strategy for Iowa.



In her opening remarks at the Kirkwood Community College roundtable,
Hillary Clinton identified four fights that will be at the center of her
campaign -- building the economy of tomorrow, strengthening families and
communities, fixing our dysfunctional political system, and protecting
America from threats.



Below is a sampling of the overwhelmingly positive reaction to today's
events and a transcript of those remarks:

22a59a27c7.html>:*

"The visit to Monticello demonstrates to Jones County Democratic Party
Chairwoman Arlie Willems that Clinton is serious when she says her 2016
presidential campaign will be focused on real people and their concerns.

'I think she wants to start with the grass roots, and by starting in a
rural area, it accentuates her concerns about people who sometimes think
they are ignored,' Willems said. [...] =E2=80=9CEvery election is different=
. I
happen to think that the strategy of being accessible to people and going
all over the state is a good strategy,' [Gov. Terry Branstad] said."

"Democrat Hillary Clinton, at the first official event of her presidential
campaign, spelled out the ideas that she said will be at the heart of her
campaign. 'I want to be the champion who goes to bat for Americans in four
big areas,' she told four students and two educators at a roundtable staged
in an automotive technology classroom at a branch campus of Kirkwood
Community College."

"Hillary Rodham Clinton began laying out her Democratic presidential
campaign message in Iowa on Tuesday, casting herself as a 'champion' for
struggling Americans and calling for a purging of 'unaccountable money'
from the campaign finance system. [...] In Iowa, she outlined four tenets
of her early campaign: improving the economy, strengthening families,
fixing 'dysfunctional government,' and protecting national security."



*Bloomberg
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-14/hillary-clinton-begi=
ns-iowa-meet-and-greet>:*

"Clinton's focus as she launches her candidacy is on reaching out to voters
in intimate settings, and the Jones Street Java House certainly was one, as
about a half dozen people waited to speak with her. [...] "It's a pleasant
surprise," said Jeff Williams of American Fire and Safety, a local business
owner and husband of the cafe's co-owner, Jen Williams.



*Los Angeles Times
<http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-hillary-clinton-i=

Clinton adopted a populist air at her first public event, which was held in
an auto shop at Kirkwood Community College=E2=80=99s Jones County Regional =
Center.
She toured the facility and then sat at a table with teachers and students,
under two vertical car lifts. [...] Clinton=E2=80=99s first appeal was deep=
ly
focused on Iowa =E2=80=94 besides the interstate reference, she touted the =
college
debt levels of the state at one point. But she also used the visit to
remind voters of the biography of one of the world=E2=80=99s best-known wom=

"'The fact that she is coming to Monticello first, a small town in Iowa,
she could have went to Iowa City, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo,' said Kaela
Weber, a Monticello High School junior whole will be 18 on Election Day. 'I
think it just means she is downhearted and just likes to care about the
community and small town.'"

"Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling for changes to the nation's campaign
finance system, saying here Tuesday that she would support a constitutional
amendment if that's what it takes to fix what she called a 'dysfunctional'

Holding her first official campaign event at Kirkwood Community College in
rural Monticello, Clinton identified campaign finance reform as one of
several pillars of her 2016 presidential campaign."

*Transcript Of Hillary Clinton Remarks At Kirkwood Community College:*

HILLARY CLINTON: I just want to tell you a little bit about why I=E2=80=99m=
 here
today. I think we all know that Americans have come back from some pretty
tough economic times. And, our economy and our country are much better off
because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it
work. But, I think it=E2=80=99s fair to say that as you look across the cou=
ntry,
the deck is still stacked in favor of those already at the top. And,
there=E2=80=99s something wrong with that.

There=E2=80=99s something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typi=
cal
worker. There=E2=80=99s something wrong when American workers keep getting =
more
productive, as they have, and as I just saw a few minutes ago is very
possible because of education and skills training, but that productivity is
not matched in their paychecks.

And there=E2=80=99s something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax =
rates
than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here over
the last two days. And there=E2=80=99s something wrong when students and th=
eir
families have to go deeply into debt to be able to get the education and
skills they need in order to make the best of their own lives. And I looked
at the figures. The average Iowa graduate, from a four-year college, comes
out with nearly $30,000 in debt and that=E2=80=99s I think the ninth highes=
t debt
load in the country and people are struggling. I met earlier today with a
young student who is piecing together work and loans, knowing full well
he=E2=80=99s going to come out owing a lot of money.

So, we=E2=80=99ve got to figure out in our country how to get back on the r=
ight
track and I=E2=80=99m running for president because I think that Americans =
and
their families need a champion =E2=80=93 and I want to be that champion. I =
want to
stand up and fight for people so that they can not just get by, but they
can get ahead, and they can stay ahead. And a lot of people in the last few
days have asked me, =E2=80=9CWell, you know, why do you want do this? What
motivates you?=E2=80=9D And I=E2=80=99ve thought a lot about it and I guess=
 the short
answer is: I=E2=80=99ve been fighting for children and families my entire a=
dult
life, probably because of my mother=E2=80=99s example.

She had a really difficult childhood =E2=80=93 was mistreated, neglected, b=
ut she
never gave up. She had to basically be on her own at the time she was
fourteen and she just kept going. And my father who was a small businessman
and just believed that you had to work hard to make your way and do
whatever you had to do to be successful and provided a good living for our
family. And then I was thinking too about, you know, the lessons I learned
from my church. You know, you=E2=80=99re supposed to give back. You=E2=80=
=99re supposed to
do what you can to help others and that=E2=80=99s what I=E2=80=99ve tried t=
o do and we=E2=80=99ll
have more time to talk about that as we go forward.

When I got out of law school I worked for the Children=E2=80=99s Defense Fu=
nd and
one of the projects there was literally going door-to-door. This was back
in the =E2=80=9870=E2=80=99s when kids with disabilities were basically shu=
t out of our
schools, and thanks to your great former Senator, Tom Harkin, that=E2=80=99=
s no
longer the case. But I was knocking on doors saying, =E2=80=9Cis there anyb=
ody
school-aged not in school?=E2=80=9D And finding blind kids and deaf kids an=
d kids
in wheelchairs who were just left out and I was able in Arkansas to work to
try and improve education there and give more kids chances who really
deserved them. And then as First Lady to fight for healthcare reform and
keep fighting until we got health care insurance for kids. And then as
Senator, dealing with the problems that faced New York after 9/11 and
trying to help people get whatever they needed - the victims=E2=80=99 famil=
ies, the
first responders. It was an incredible honor to do that. And then, as
Secretary of State, standing up for our country.

So when I look at where we are as a country, I am just so absolutely
convinced that there isn=E2=80=99t anybody, anywhere, who can outcompete us=
 =E2=80=93 who
has better values, who can do more to provide more people the chance to
live up to their own God given potential. But we can=E2=80=99t take that fo=
r
granted, and so I want to be the champion who goes to bat for Americans in
four big areas =E2=80=93 four big fights =E2=80=93 that I think we have to =
take on because
there are those don=E2=80=99t agree with what I think we should be doing, a=
nd
they=E2=80=99re pretty powerful forces.

We need to build the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday. We need to
strengthen families and communities, because that=E2=80=99s where it all st=
arts. We
need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money
out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amendment.
And we need to protect our country from the threats that we see, and the
ones that are on the horizon.

So, I=E2=80=99m here in Iowa to begin a conversation about how we do that a=
nd to
hear from people about what=E2=80=99s on your minds =E2=80=93 what the chal=
lenges that you
see are. And I=E2=80=99m going to work hard to meet as many people. I=E2=80=
=99ll be rolling
out ideas and policies about what I think will work. But, I want it to be
informed by what=E2=80=99s actually working, and to build on what works goi=
ng
forward. And to stand up against those who have a different vision of our
country. A different one than I grew up with, and a different one than what
I think is best for everybody.

So, with that, what I=E2=80=99d love to do is just, you know, ask a few que=
stions
and hear from folks about what their experiences have been and, you know,
try to learn what you think would be ways of helping more young people get
the kind of education they need without having the personal bank be broken
and put you and your family at financial risk.

style=3D"color:#1a1a1a">HILLARY CLINTON: I just want to tell you a little b=
it about why I=E2=80=99m here today. I think we all know that Americans hav=
e come back from some pretty tough economic times. And, our economy and our=
 country are much better off because American families have basically done =
whatever it took to make it work. But, I think it=E2=80=99s fair to say tha=
t as you look across the country, the deck is still stacked in favor of tho=
se already at the top. And, there=E2=80=99s something wrong with that.</spa=
n></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span style=3D"color:#1a1a1a">There=E2=
=80=99s something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical work=
er. There=E2=80=99s something wrong when American workers keep getting more=
 productive, as they have, and as I just saw a few minutes ago is very poss=
ible because of education and skills training, but that productivity is not=
 matched in their paychecks.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span s=
tyle=3D"color:#1a1a1a">And there=E2=80=99s something wrong when hedge fund =
managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80=
 as I was driving here over the last two days. And there=E2=80=99s somethin=
g wrong when students and their families have to go deeply into debt to be =
able to get the education and skills they need in order to make the best of=
 their own lives. And I looked at the figures. The average Iowa graduate, f=
rom a four-year college, comes out with nearly $30,000 in debt and that=E2=
=80=99s I think the ninth highest debt load in the country and people are s=
truggling. I met earlier today with a young student who is piecing together=
 work and loans, knowing full well he=E2=80=99s going to come out owing a l=
ot of money.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span style=3D"color:#1=
a1a1a">So, we=E2=80=99ve got to figure out in our country how to get back o=
n the right track and I=E2=80=99m running for president because I think tha=
t Americans and their families need a champion =E2=80=93 and I want to be t=
hat champion. I want to stand up and fight for people so that they can not =
just get by, but they can get ahead, and they can stay ahead. And a lot of =
people in the last few days have asked me, =E2=80=9CWell, you know, why do =
you want do this? What motivates you?=E2=80=9D And I=E2=80=99ve thought a l=
ot about it and I guess the short answer is: I=E2=80=99ve been fighting for=
 children and families my entire adult life, probably because of my mother=
=E2=80=99s example.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span style=3D"c=
olor:#1a1a1a">She had a really difficult childhood =E2=80=93 was mistreated=
, neglected, but she never gave up. She had to basically be on her own at t=
he time she was fourteen and she just kept going. And my father who was a s=
mall businessman and just believed that you had to work hard to make your w=
ay and do whatever you had to do to be successful and provided a good livin=
g for our family. And then I was thinking too about, you know, the lessons =
I learned from my church. You know, you=E2=80=99re supposed to give back. Y=
ou=E2=80=99re supposed to do what you can to help others and that=E2=80=99s=
 what I=E2=80=99ve tried to do and we=E2=80=99ll have more time to talk abo=
ut that as we go forward.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span styl=
e=3D"color:#1a1a1a">When I got out of law school I worked for the Children=
=E2=80=99s Defense Fund and one of the projects there was literally going d=
oor-to-door. This was back in the =E2=80=9870=E2=80=99s when kids with disa=
bilities were basically shut out of our schools, and thanks to your great f=
ormer Senator, Tom Harkin, that=E2=80=99s no longer the case. But I was kno=
cking on doors saying, =E2=80=9Cis there anybody school-aged not in school?=
=E2=80=9D And finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheelchairs who =
were just left out and I was able in Arkansas to work to try and improve ed=
ucation there and give more kids chances who really deserved them. And then=
 as First Lady to fight for healthcare reform and keep fighting until we go=
t health care insurance for kids. And then as Senator, dealing with the pro=
blems that faced New York after 9/11 and trying to help people get whatever=
 they needed - the victims=E2=80=99 families, the first responders. It was =
an incredible honor to do that. And then, as Secretary of State, standing u=
p for our country.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span style=3D"co=
lor:#1a1a1a">So when I look at where we are as a country, I am just so abso=
lutely convinced that there isn=E2=80=99t anybody, anywhere, who can outcom=
pete us =E2=80=93 who has better values, who can do more to provide more pe=
ople the chance to live up to their own God given potential. But we can=E2=
=80=99t take that for granted, and so I want to be the champion who goes to=
 bat for Americans in four big areas =E2=80=93 four big fights =E2=80=93 th=
at I think we have to take on because there are those don=E2=80=99t agree w=
ith what I think we should be doing, and they=E2=80=99re pretty powerful fo=
rces.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span style=3D"color:#1a1a1a">=
We need to build the economy of=C2=A0tomorrow, not yesterday. We need to st=
rengthen families and communities, because that=E2=80=99s where it all star=
ts. We need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable=
 money out of it once and for all, even if that takes a constitutional amen=
dment. And we need to protect our country from the threats that we see, and=
 the ones that are on the horizon.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><=
span style=3D"color:#1a1a1a">So, I=E2=80=99m here in Iowa to begin a conver=
sation about how we do that and to hear from people about what=E2=80=99s on=
 your minds =E2=80=93 what the challenges that you see are. And I=E2=80=99m=
 going to work hard to meet as many people. I=E2=80=99ll be rolling out ide=
as and policies about what I think will work. But, I want it to be informed=
 by what=E2=80=99s actually working, and to build on what works going forwa=
rd. And to stand up against those who have a different vision of our countr=
y. A different one than I grew up with, and a different one than what I thi=
nk is best for everybody.</span></p><p class=3D"MsoNormal" style><span styl=
e=3D"color:#1a1a1a">So, with that, what I=E2=80=99d love to do is just, you=
 know, ask a few questions and hear from folks about what their experiences=
 have been and, you know, try to learn what you think would be ways of help=
ing more young people get the kind of education they need without having th=
e personal bank be broken and put you and your family at financial risk.</s=
