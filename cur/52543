John -

Nikki and I had a great meeting yesterday with John Stocks and his
team. And you heard the good news that 82% of the PAC voted to support
HRC. John Stocks feels really strongly that HRC's performance really
will make it or break it on Saturday. We are pulling together good
prep materials and asking for some time for the three of us to get on
phone with her to go over highlights.

On Saturday, Nikki thinks it would be very helpful if you or I went to
the NEA meeting with her to show senior leadership support and be
there in room for any questions/follow up after. It's at 11 am on
Saturday in DC. Can you attend? I had to come back to CA for family
reasons today but could take redeye on Friday night if you are not
free.

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Ann
