WONK ROOM: McCain's Plan To 'Redistribute The Wealth' To The Already Wealth=
y

McCain's Plan To 'Redistribute The Wealth' To The Already Wealthy<http://wo=
nkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/10/21/mccain-already-wealthy/>

WASHINGTON, DC-Recently, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has been criticizing Sen. =
Barack Obama (D-IL) for his belief "in redistributing wealth<http://www.bos=
ton.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/10/mccain_presses_2.html>.=
" "I'm not going to redistribute your wealth<http://www.detnews.com/apps/pb=
cs.dll/article?AID=3D/20081019/METRO/810190327/1409/METRO>," claims McCain.

However, McCain is absolutely going to redistribute wealth. He is just goin=
g to redistribute it to the already wealthy. By doubling down on the Bush t=
ax cuts<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/03/21/mccain-norquist-agenda=
/> and proposing $175 billion in tax cuts for corporations, McCain's polici=
es will exacerbate the already astounding income inequality in the United S=
tates.

On Monday, the Organization for Economic Development (OECD) released a repo=
rt<http://www.oecd.org/document/25/0,3343,en_2649_201185_41530009_1_1_1_1,0=
0.html> showing that "the United States has the highest inequality and pove=
rty<http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081021/ap_on_bi_ge/eu_oecd_income_inequali=
ty;_ylt=3DAqM28WL0huYtFxr5XYELgClu24cA> in the OECD after Mexico and Turkey=
, and the gap has increased rapidly since 2000." The report notes that "in =
the United States, the richest 10 percent earn an average of US$93,000 - th=
e highest level in the OECD. The poorest 10 percent earn an average of US$5=
,800 - about 20 percent lower than the OECD average<http://news.yahoo.com/s=
/ap/20081021/ap_on_bi_ge/eu_oecd_income_inequality;_ylt=3DAqM28WL0huYtFxr5X=
YELgClu24cA>."

An analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund shows that Pres=
ident Bush's economic policies "redistributed wealth to the richest America=
ns<http://pr.thinkprogress.org/2008/08/pr20080807> and left the majority wi=
th stagnating wages and declining household incomes." As Scott Lilly noted<=
http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/10/redistribution.html> yesterd=
ay:

Based on data prepared by the Internal Revenue Service from tax returns fil=
ed during the post-9/11 recovery (2002 to 2006), household income grew by $=
863 billion during the period. The 15,000 families at the top of the income=
 scale saw their annual incomes go from about $15 million a year to nearly =
$30 million. They alone accounted for more than 25 percent of all of the gr=
owth in income for the entire country.

The remaining 1.7 million families in the top 1 percent of households accou=
nted for nearly another 50 percent.

Currently, the United States' income concentration is at its highest level =
since 1928<http://www.cbpp.org/3-27-08tax2.htm>. Meanwhile, McCain has embr=
aced the Bush economic agenda, proposing making the Bush tax cuts permanent=
, a move from which the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers would only see 12<ht=
tp://www.cbpp.org/2-4-08tax.htm> percent of the benefit. McCain's tax plan =
gives no benefit to over 100 million middle class households<http://wonkroo=
m.thinkprogress.org/2008/09/15/mccain-will-cut-taxes-for-literally-everyone=
except-100-million-households/>, but does give $175 billion in tax breaks<h=
ttp://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/pdf/tax_agenda.pdf> to Ame=
rica's corporations.

But income inequality is cause for even more concern than the simple number=
s suggest, since it also has an effect on mobility. McCain said yesterday t=
hat "in this country, we believe in spreading opportunity<http://thepage.ti=
me.com/prepared-remarks-for-mccain-in-bensalem-pennsylvania/>." It should g=
ive him pause, then, to note that just "7 percent of children born to paren=
ts in the bottom wealth quintile make it to the top quintile<http://www.eco=
nomicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/Economic_Mobility_in_America_Key%20Findings.p=
df> in adulthood," and "36 percent of children born to parents in the botto=
m wealth quintile remain in the bottom<http://www.economicmobility.org/asse=
ts/pdfs/Economic_Mobility_in_America_Key%20Findings.pdf> as adults."

OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said that "greater income inequality st=
ifles upward mobility between generations, making it harder for talented an=
d hard-working people to get the rewards they deserve<http://news.yahoo.com=
/s/ap/20081021/ap_on_bi_ge/eu_oecd_income_inequality;_ylt=3DAqM28WL0huYtFxr=
5XYELgClu24cA>."

As Matthew Yglesias wrote yesterday<http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archi=
ves/2008/10/growing_unequal.php>:

It's neither possible nor desirable to have complete equality of income, we=
alth, or opportunity. But at the same time, it's impossible to prevent larg=
e inequalities in income and wealth from creating the kind of large inequal=
ities in opportunity that most people, including people like McCain who are=
 committed to making the distribution of wealth and income as unequal as po=
ssible, find undesirable.
