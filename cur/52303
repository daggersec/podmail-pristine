Prof. Podesta,

I believe we=E2=80=99re supposed to email you a proposed topic for our pape=
r before
tomorrow. My proposed topic is Reforming the Government Accountability
Office.

I am very interested in the GAO and the unique role it plays in
facilitating Congressional inquiry into the actions of the Executive
branch. For my paper I would like to explore possible reforms to the GAO,
specifically ways to: (1) strengthen the GAO=E2=80=99s power to effectively
investigate the Executive branch (particularly given Walker v. Cheney,
etc.); and (2) increase the GAO=E2=80=99s ability to initiate investigation=
s and
operate independently of Congress (particularly relevant given how divided
and gridlocked Congress is these days). Ideally, I would discuss potential
ways to accomplish these goals as well as the pros and cons of each.

 See you tomorrow,
