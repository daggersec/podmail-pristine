Congrats to both of you =E2=80=A6 you made parole. :) Seriously =E2=80=A6 =
wonderful job. You got a lot done.

Just checking to see if this is the right email addresses to be using =
going forward.

I have a new pamphlet out, based on https://Yo.YourHonor.Org/, my =
attempt to make friends with the Chief Justice. Happy to send a copy =
out, let me know the appropriate snailmail address.

Best regards,
