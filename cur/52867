John --

If we win this election, it will be because of what you did in=20
moments like this to help close the spending gap.

Because this is real: Just last week alone, Mitt Romney's=20
campaign and his allies outspent our side by at least three=20
to one in North Carolina, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado,=20
and Pennsylvania, all states we need to win.

That could swing the election -- but it doesn't have to.

Tomorrow is our biggest fundraising deadline so far. Will you=20
make a donation of $5 or more today and help this campaign=20
hang in there for the final two months?

https://donate.barackobama.com/August-Deadline

Tonight Mitt Romney will deliver a speech that millions of Americans=20
will hear.

He's going to say a lot of things about Barack Obama, and belittle=20
what we stand for.

When he does, remember the important role you play in the political=20
process. Remember the kind of man our president is, and the tough=20
choices he's had to make from that Oval Office.

Voters in some very important states are hearing distortions and lies=20
from people who've invested a lot to see Barack Obama removed=20
from the White House.

Fight back. Donate $5 or more and make sure your voice is heard=20
just as loud:

https://donate.barackobama.com/August-Deadline

We wouldn't be here without you. Thank you.

Joe

P.S. -- Deciding that the stakes are high enough to do our part isn't a=20
November 6th decision. It's one I'm asking you to make right now, =
before=20
tomorrow's big fundraising deadline:=20
