John --

Last week, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell got all 41 =
GOP senators to promise to oppose Wall Street reform. He thought President =
Obama would back down in the face of a unified show of force.

He was wrong.

Instead, the President stood in front of Wall Street bankers yesterday, =
going to bat for consumers and confronting the toughest of crowds with a =
strong message: Reform is good for Americans, good for the market, and =
it's time to get on board.

Bipartisan discussions have begun again -- but Wall Street lobbyists are =
still swarming Capitol Hill, trying to trip up negotiations and maintain =
the gridlock that has defined Washington for far too long.

So now, it's up to us. We need to show Senate Republicans that the =
American people are watching closely to see whose side they end up on.

Tell Sen. McConnell to stop standing in the way of desperately needed =
change to win favor with your Wall Street allies:

http://my.barackobama.com/WallStreetReformLetters5?zipcode=3D20016

The President laid out a bold plan to hold Wall Street accountable, to =
protect American taxpayers by ensuring they'll never again be asked to =
bail out a big firm "too big to fail," and to put in place the strongest =
consumer financial protections ever proposed.

But this fight isn't just about fixing Wall Street. It's also about fixing =
Washington.

For too long, it's been a place where special interests have set the rules =
and petty partisanship has stood in the way of progress. As the President =
said yesterday, "We can and must put this kind of cynical politics aside."

Thanks to strong leadership from the President and Democrats in Congress, =
the gridlock is starting to crack, and Republicans are slowly giving signs =
that they'll come on board. The Senate has even scheduled a preliminary =
vote for Monday at 5:15 p.m.

But Wall Street lobbyists are flooding in to firm up opposition -- trying =
to carve out loopholes and exemptions for big banks and lenders who have =
long exploited consumers.

The only sure-fire way to make sure that the special interests don't get =
their way is to show Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans that Americans =
are standing firmly with the President. Tell them to join us to fight for =
American families who are counting on reform, not the big Wall Street =
banks. Send a letter today:
