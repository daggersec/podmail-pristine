TransCanada Corp. (TRP)=92s proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline is a =93terri=
ble idea=94 that won=92t benefit anyone, Canadian musician Neil Young said.

=93This fuel is all going to China, which is probably the dirtiest place on=
 the planet,=94 Young told reporters before a concert in Winnipeg, Manitoba=
, yesterday.

Young, who formed his first bands in the city and was inducted into the Roc=
k and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, is on tour to raise money for the Athabasc=
a Chipewyan First Nation, which is fighting to stop oil-sands expansion on =
their traditional lands. His tour comes as President Barack Obama=92s gover=
nment weighs whether to approve TransCanada=92s $5.4 billion link between A=
lberta=92s oil sands and the U.S. Gulf Coast as production in the province =
surges.

Canadian oil-sands output is set to rise to 4.5 million barrels a day by 20=
25, more than double a decade earlier, according to a forecast from the Can=
adian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). The U.S. State Department =
is preparing a final version of an environmental review that will assess wh=
ether Keystone would contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions that scientists=
 say are warming the planet.

The musician said parts of Alberta will =93look like the moon=94 if Canada =
doesn=92t move to preserve land.

VIDEO: Everything You Need to Know About Keystone XL<http://www.businesswee=
k.com/videos/2013-12-22/everything-you-need-to-know-about-keystone-xl>
=91Huge Mess=92

=93It is like a war zone, a disaster area,=94 Young said at Winnipeg=92s Ce=
ntennial Concert Hall, hours before he was to take the stage.

Almost all of Canada=92s oil exports are shipped to the U.S., according to =
the National Energy Board, an independent regulatory agency. Last year, onl=
y conventional light oil was exported from Canada outside North America, ac=
cording to the agency.

The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, located about 200 kilometers (124 mil=
es) from oil sands in Alberta, claims continued development violates its tr=
eaty rights and contaminates waterways and food systems, according to its w=
ebsite. The First Nation, as aboriginal groups are also called in Canada, i=
s challenging Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)=92s Jackpine oil-sands mine expa=
nsion, the proposed Pierre River mine and an Alberta land use plan.

Canada has made a =93huge mess=94 in dealing with aboriginals, Young said.

=93The integrity of Canada is at stake,=94 he said. =93When you make a deal=
, you=92ve got to stick with the deal you=92ve made.=94

The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation is in favour of economic development a=
s long as it is done in a reasonable and sustainable way, Chief Allan Adam =
said at the press conference yesterday with Young. The federal and provinci=
al governments need to consult with First Nations when development is occur=
ring on their traditional lands where they hunt, fish and gather food, he s=
aid.

=93Our treaties are being broken in more ways than one,=94 Allan said.

Young=92s statements demonstrate his lack of understanding of the oil sands=
 and the realities of North America=92s energy mix, according to a statemen=
t released yesterday by CAPP, which represents companies that produce 90 pe=
rcent of Canada=92s natural gas and crude oil. Canadians need constructive =
dialog about energy matters based on facts rather than =93ill-informed opin=
ions and inflammatory rhetoric from protest-anthem rock stars,=94 the group=
 said in a statement.

Output Rising

Oil sands production is set to surge in the coming decade with companies in=
cluding Shell, Suncor Energy Inc. (SU), Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) racing to=
 boost output with industry-wide investments of more than C$20 billion annu=
ally, according to data from CAPP.

Impacts include wastewater, used in mining bitumen, destruction of wildlife=
 habitat and air pollution, according to environmental think-tank Pembina I=
nstitute.

It=92s impossible for new resource development projects to proceed in Canad=
a without appropriate consultation and accommodation for aboriginal groups,=
 Gordon Nettleton, a partner at McCarthy Tetrault LLP in Calgary, who has r=
epresented energy companies in discussions with native groups, said in a ph=
one interview.

=93The reality that Neil Young probably doesn=92t know and understand is th=
at whenever resource development happens in the oil sands, it=92s common if=
 not first practice to have First Nations enter into confidential impact-be=
nefit agreements in some way, shape or form, with resource developers,=94 N=
ettleton said.

Support Declines

Canadian support for Keystone XL has declined to 52 percent in December fro=
m 68 percent in April, while opposition has increased to 40 percent from 28=
 percent, according to a poll released Jan. 15 by Nanos Research Group. The=
 survey of 1,000 Canadians taken between Dec. 14 and Dec. 16 has a margin o=
f error of 3.1 percentage points, according to the Ottawa-based agency.
