John--
Confidentially, I wanted to reach out to let you know that while I'm honore=
d to be part of Priorities, I would be happy to flip to the campaign if nee=
ded. =20
Here's where I think my skills could be helpful:  on the surrogate side, wh=
ere I know she will have an enormous demand, I could be a surrogate to stat=
es, state dem parties (particularly if you need people in states or at time=
s where she will not be able to campaign), make appearances on local or nat=
ional media, meet with local electeds, listening to local dems, etc.  While=
 Priorities' role is obviously key, I'd be happy to serve in any other role=
 as well.  I'm pretty good at connecting with dems anywhere, getting them m=
otivated, and message delivery. =20
Just wanted to let you know, as you plug people into roles on the campaign =
side. =20
Obviously I'm happy to be involved either way.
Best --
Jennifer Granholm
