=20
An  Historic Sunday: March 21, 2010=20

Sunday, March 21st, 2010.  Remember that date. =20
I have been involved in progressive politics for over four decades.  This=
=20
Sunday at 2:00 pm, the House of  Representatives will convene to conduct th=
e=20
most important vote it has cast in  those forty years. The vote is historic=
=20
both on substantive and political  grounds. =20
If it passes, the health care reform bill will make it national policy =20
that health care is finally a right in the United States of  America. And i=
t=20
will rein in the out-of-control  private health insurance industry that has=
=20
given us a health care system that  costs two times more per person than an=
y=20
other country and produces results that  rank only 37th in the world.  It=
=20
will mark a turning point in a century-long struggle between the  interests=
 of=20
everyday Americans and enormously powerful private interests. =20
That vote will also have a massive impact on the future of the Obama =20
Presidency and the progressive movement in America.  Success will empower h=
im =96=20
and the  Democratic Party and progressive forces at its base =96 to make mo=
re=20
change.  It will empower us to hold accountable  the Wall Street banks that=
=20
wrecked our economy and cost seven million Americans  their jobs.  It will=
=20
empower us to  lay the foundation for the creation of millions of clean ene=
rgy=20
jobs =96 and free  America from the tyranny of foreign  oil.  It will=20
strengthen our ability  to pressure Congress to create the jobs America so=
=20
desperately needs.  =20
Failure, on the other hand, would deal an incredible blow to the  President=
=92
s ability to make progressive change.  For the President, and for all of us=
=20
who  hold progressive values, failure is simply not an option.=20
To his credit,  President Obama has bet the political ranch on the outcome=
=20
of Sunday=92s  vote.  On Sunday, we=92ll all see what  he=92s got in his ha=
nd.=20
The vote on Sunday will also have an enormous effect on the President=92s =
=20
ability to fix our broken immigration system.  This gets me to the second=
=20
reason that  Sunday will be such an historic day.=20
Several miles down the mall =96 at exactly the same moment that Congress =
=20
convenes to pass health care reform =96 tens of thousands of supporters of =
=20
immigration reform will gather to demand that Congress to pass a long overd=
ue =20
overhaul of the nation=92s immigration system.  The crowd will include immi=
grant=20
 families, people in law enforcement, public officials, religious and labor=
=20
 leaders =96 and representatives from the business community.  =20
The families of immigrants =96 and especially Latino immigrants =96 are =20
increasingly desperate for change, because while immigration enforcement an=
d =20
deportations have inexorably moved forward, until recently immigration refo=
rm =20
has not. =20
Now, that has begun to change.  Today, Democratic Senator Charles  Schumer=
=20
and Republican Lindsey Graham published a bi-partisan blueprint for =20
immigration reform in an op-ed for the Washington Post.  The President resp=
onded=20
with an  endorsement of that blueprint -- and Senate Majority Leader Harry=
=20
Reid committed  that if a bill based on the blueprint is reported out of=20
Committee, it will be  considered this year on the Senate floor. =20
The march on Sunday could easily be remembered as the historic, symbolic =
=20
beginning of a campaign that finally brings order and justice to America=92=
s=20
shattered immigration  system =96 and with it hope for millions of immigran=
t=20
families that currently live  in the shadows of Americans society. =20
The immigration reform forces are not calling for amnesty.  They are=20
advocating a common sense,  bi-partisan proposal to sharpen and modernize=
=20
immigration enforcement,  rationalize future immigration, and require that=
=20
immigrants that are now  undocumented become legal residents, pay a fine, a=
nd be=20
integrated into the  mainstream of the American economy.  They are advocati=
ng=20
proposals that would end what amounts to a black  market in human labor tha=
t=20
undercuts the salaries of American workers and makes  employers who play by=
=20
the rules uncompetitive. =20
But just as the health care vote  carries with it massive political=20
implications for the future of the progressive  movement in America, the=20
immigration struggle may  have far-reaching consequences for the future of =
the=20
Republican Party.  =20
One segment of the Republican Party =96 lead by Senator Graham =96 =20
understands all too well that the Republican Party will ultimately be consi=
gned  to=20
permanent minority status if it cannot appeal to the growing number of =20
Hispanic Americans.  And he also  understands that immigration is a politic=
ally=20
realigning issue for Hispanics  that is every bit as potent as the Civil=20
Rights movement was for African  Americans.  =20
In the months ahead we=92ll see if other Republicans follow Graham=92s lead=
, =20
or whether they take the path of least political resistance in the short=20
term  and squander their political relevance in the decades to come.=20
On the one hand, Sunday, March  21st could mark the climax of a=20
decades-long battle to make health  care a right.  On the other, it  could =
begin the=20
final chapter of a struggle that has enormous consequences for  millions of=
=20
immigrant families and the future of the American economy.  =20
One way or the other, March 21st could be a big day in the  history of the=
=20
United  States.  But the significance of March 21st, 2010 will not be =20
determined the way this weekend=92s NCAA playoffs are decided --  a few sta=
r=20
players won=92t be the only  thing that counts.=20
In both cases, everyday  Americans, from all over the country, will have an=
=20
enormous say about the  outcome.=20
The results of Sunday=92s health care vote are still very much up for  grab=
s.=20
 A lot will ride on what the  remaining swing members of Congress hear from=
=20
their constituents between now and  2 p.m. Sunday.  It would be =20
unthinkable if health care reform loses by one or two votes.  =20
Yesterday, speaking to the House Democratic Caucus, Congressman John  Lewis=
=20
(D-GA)--who helped lead the historic civil rights march from Selma to=20
Montgomery, a man who knows something about  making history -- called on hi=
s=20
colleagues to stand up and do the same. =20
He told them that some people say that voting for health care reform is a  =
=93
dangerous=94 vote.  But, he said,  there are no police with bludgeons, fire=
=20
hoses or guns waiting when you cross  this bridge. We=92re not calling on y=
ou=20
to confront growling dogs.  =93You just put your voting card in the  slot a=
nd=20
you vote yes =96 and you make history,=94  he said.=20
The insurance companies and their  political allies are engaged in a=20
desperate last-ditch effort to stop the  bill.  They are flooding the Capit=
ol=20
switchboard with  calls.  Don=92t let them drown out the  voices of everyda=
y=20
Americans.  If you=92ve called before, call your Member  of Congress again =
=96 right=20
now, at 202-225-3121 =96 the moment you finish reading  this column.  =20
Tell them to step up and make  history. Tell them that if they vote right,=
=20
you=92ve got their back.  =20
Tell them that you=92ll campaign for their re-election, and defend them =20
against the lies and fear that the insurance companies have used, without s=
hame,=20
 to try to protect their CEO salaries and exploding profits. =20
Tell them to do  what=92s right for America and the future of their =20
grandkids, and to forget about trying to trade their votes for petty paroch=
ial =20
benefits.  Ask them to search their  souls about why they came to Congress =
in=20
the first place.=20
Tell them that they must choose between the interests of the insurance =20
giants and those of everyday Americans.   Tell them you will hold them=20
accountable at the  polls.=20
The same goes for the immigration battle.  There is still plenty of time to=
=20
go to the  Mall in Washington,  DC for this Sunday=92s march  =96 or to sig=
n=20
up to be part of the  rapidly-building campaign to pass immigration reform.=
 =20
This Sunday, the spirit of the late Senator Ted Kennedy will once again =20
infuse Washington.  Throughout his career he led both the  battle for=20
universal health care and for immigration reform. =20
This Sunday, March  21st, let=92s make Senator Kennedy proud.=20
Robert Creamer is a  long-time political organizer and strategist, and=20
author of the recent  book:  Stand Up Straight: How  Progressives Can Win,=
