All,

For the WaPo story we have been discussing, they asked for an on the record=
 response to the following question. Draft response is below with includes =
feedback from Jen, Nick, Philippe, Matt etc.

Including everyone on this email because I need a quick response about incl=
uding the CHAI stats. The fact is, at the time, CHAI was more compelling me=
tric, most understandable accomplishment to the public and, importantly, wh=
at a majority of the foreign government funding supported.

Please let me know if you have any concerns in the next 30 minutes.

Thanks,

Craig

Q. Why was it important for the foundation that some foreign government don=
ations be allowed to continue after Hillary Clinton became secretary of sta=
te (i.e. those from governments that had been giving and then continued to =
do so at a steady pace, as well as new or increased donation that cleared a=
 state department review)? Why do foundation officials believe such donatio=
ns did not pose any conflicts of interest given Secretary Clinton's role, a=
s some have alleged?

"As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, org=
anizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addres=
sing critical global challenges in a meaningful way. When anyone contribute=
s to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards Foundation programs that save =
lives. The majority of this support from governments is for specific, multi=
-year programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around th=
e world and were underway well before Secretary Clinton took office.  It's =
hard to imagine someone arguing that funding should be cut off for the more=
 than 8 million people getting access to live-saving HIV/AIDS medicine in m=
ore than 70 countries, the nearly 40,000 farmers in Malawi, Tanzania, and R=
wanda trying to earn a better living or the reduction of 33,500 tons of gre=
enhouse gas emissions annually."
