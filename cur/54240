Dear Friend,

In Mel Gibson's and Tina Turner's movie, "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome," the =
rules of Thunderdome are simple "two men enter, one man leaves."

Likewise, in this U.S. Senate race, two men enter the arena, one man leaves=
 ... victorious.

This past weekend, Pennsylvania's newspaper, The Morning Call, ran profile =
pieces of Congressman Toomey and Joe that were written by the same reporter=
. The styles between the two men, and their approach to governing never cle=
arer than in the way they approach campaigning.

As to Joe, the reporter wrote:

"Joe Sestak ...is unconventional, and if there's one absolute to his campai=
gn style, it's =E2=80=A6 [his] almost obsessive desire to connect to voters=
....

Sestak  =E2=80=A6 a former three-star Navy admiral who is compassionate =E2=
=80=A6 His brain is filled with so much information at any given moment, so=
 many statistics and facts, that he seems eager to relay it all in one brea=
th....He wants every person he encounters to have access to the same inform=
ation he has...

Now running for the U.S. Senate, Sestak's ground-level technique is very di=
fferent from his opponent, Republican Pat Toomey, who sees the nation's tro=
ubles from 30,000 fee [Toomey pilots his own plane across the state while c=
ampaigning] ....

As the Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania, Sestak has been crisscrossing =
the 46,000-square-mile state for months, filling each day with meet-and-gre=
ets, treating the small 10-person events with the same attentiveness as a 1=
00-person rally. It is statistically impossible to shake 12 million hands, =
but Sestak may get close.

...He will drive through the night from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, arrivin=
g at hotels at 3 a.m. only to wake up a few hours later for an event at 7 i=
n the morning. Flying is out of the question for him because for those few =
hours in the air he'd be offline and out of touch, and to him those hours a=
re too precious to waste."

As to Congressman Toomey, the reporter wrote:

"Pat Toomey  =E2=80=A6 a hard-line fiscal conservative, is running for the =
U.S. Senate in moderate Pennsylvania. He doesn't brag about his Wall Street=
 career but is unapologetic about his beliefs that government shouldn't med=
dle so much in the financial sector and should scale back spending...

In two interviews =E2=80=A6 Toomey uncorked a strong brew of conservative f=
iscal philosophy... government regulations should be minimal ...  He's the =
kind of candidate who in other election years may have scared the GOP in a =
state like Pennsylvania, which went handily for Democrats in the last two p=
residential elections.

Timing and strategy have landed the once conservative fringe candidate as a=
 party favorite ...

As a congressman, Toomey was never the consummate constituent's servant =E2=
=80=A6

Toomey has applied that [methodical] approach to his Senate campaign. He sp=
ends full days in his office with his staff making phone calls to donors an=
d eliciting support from community leaders, in stark contrast to Sestak, wh=
o crisscrosses the state trying to shake every Pennsylvanians' hand."

One man, Joe, enters the arena wanting to "shake every Pennsylvanians' hand=
." The other, Congressman Toomey, enters the arena wanting to "spend full d=
ays in his office."

Two men enter, one man leaves =E2=80=A6 victorious.=20

When you have a candidate =E2=80=A6 and a team =E2=80=A6 that is on a missi=
on to "shake every Pennsylvanian's hand" =E2=80=A6 you know that you've got=
 a winning team!!!!

We are less than 48 hours away from the end-of-the-quarter =E2=80=A6 and th=
e expiration  of our special  2:1 matching contribution program ... where a=
ll donations are doubly matched!!

We are going to win this race =E2=80=A6 thanks to your efforts TODAY =E2=80=
=A6 let's hit our end-of-quarter mark!

Best regards,

Rich Sestak
Campaign Director

P.S. And even when it comes to the Press, Joe and Congressman Toomey's acce=
ss is completely different.  Joe, open and accessible.  Congressman Toomey,=
 avoidance and running "like a deer caught in a head-light". WITF, Pennsylv=
ania's public radio station, reported:

    * "I was hoping to ask Toomey a couple questions about his stance on So=
cial Security - and what he thinks about Democrats' efforts to use the issu=
e as a scare tactic with voters - but campaign staffers whisked him away af=
ter the event, saying he was late for another appearance. The press got two=
 questions in before Toomey was hustled to an SUV, which promptly sped away=
. This approach, which I've seen a few times now, is the polar opposite of =
how Congressman Joe Sestak handles the press. The Democrat typically answer=
s question after question after question, and keeps going until reporters p=
ass out from dehydration or boredom."

When you have a candidate that is open and accessible and can out-last the =
press, you know you have a candidate that has the moral courage and leaders=
hip to make a difference in the U.S. Senate.  Please make that contribution=
 today =E2=80=A6 two men enter, one man leaves =E2=80=A6 victorious!
