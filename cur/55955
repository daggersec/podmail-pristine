Dear John,


I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving break and enjoyed a bit of time off
from work. I am well --enjoying taking the International Human Rights clini=
c
with Prof. Ross this semester.


I=92m writing because I wanted to get your advice and your help with my job
search for next summer. I am currently applying for summer associate
positions at small and medium firms but I'm having a bit of trouble securin=
g
interviews. I was wondering if you could connect me with any partners
working in firms here in D.C. that might be able to give me some advice
about the application process or that might be hiring. I am mostly
interested in litigation, but I am pretty open to learning and gaining
experience in other areas as well. I would appreciate any recommendations
you might have or any people you could put me in touch with.


Thank you!


Best,

Teresita
