Hello Mary: 


-----------------------
Make Your Dollar Go Further With a Tax Deductible Gift to Clean Water Fund 

For a limited time your donation to Clean Water Fund will be matched dollar for dollar doubling your impact! [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=8119 ] 
------------------


Although many of us are focused on holiday preparations, we here at Clean Water Fund are already celebrating an early gift! 

A generous anonymous donor has offered to double your tax deductible contribution! 

That's right, Mary, your gift of $50, $100 - or even more - will be matched dollar for dollar! [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=8119 ] 

There's no doubt it's been a difficult year for the environment, with threats to our water, our health and our future coming from all sides. From the Gulf oil spill in the spring; to the residents in Pennsylvania who were able to light their tap water on fire; to another oil spill in the Kalamazoo River over the summer - the threats to our water seemed to follow one right after another. 

Despite all of this, I could not be more proud of the things we have accomplished this year. Clean Water Fund worked tirelessly to fight off the dirty energy rush following the Gulf oil spill, campaigning in places like Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, New England and New Jersey to protect our coasts and the Great Lakes. At the same time, we continued to advance clean energy alternatives that will move the country away from the dirty polluting technologies of the past, creating new jobs and economic opportunities, while protecting our water. 

We also made progress protecting water and health with innovative "upstream solutions" that prevent pollution before it can enter our water. This summer we celebrated a long-overdue victory that spotlights the real potential for protecting our water through "upstream" pollution prevention. In July, decades after Clean Water Fund's first call to action on phosphates in laundry and dishwasher detergents, the industry finally embraced phosphate-free solutions! But that's just a start. 

Clean Water Fund is already leading precedent-setting water protection efforts in California, the Chesapeake region, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Texas. As these efforts succeed and as other communities and states join in, water quality improvements will follow. 

With your help we are making progress. Mary, your gift today will make all the difference. Please don't delay in making your tax deductible contribution today. [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=8119 ] 

Thank you in advance for doing your part at this critical time. 

Now and for the Future, 
Robert Wendelgass 
Interim CEO 

P.S. Together - with your support - we are making progress that is preventing pollution, creating safer and more livable communities, and ensuring supplies of clean, safe and affordable water. Please help us reach our goal to raise $25,000 by the end of this year by making a tax deductible donation today.
