PEACE POETRY

Religions are based on scripture, which is mostly poetry. So it only =
makes sense that religious conflict must be resolved through poetry, and =
not through politics, negotiation, or war. I propose that all religious =
conflicts be redefined poetically, so that they can be resolved without =
bloodshed, winners, or losers. So let's sharpen our pencils, not our =
swords; send missives, not missiles; and apply our minds to metaphor, =
simile, rhyme, meter, and prosody, but not pomposity, animosity, =
ferocity, atrocity, or monstrosity.


Best regards,
Hugh Mann
