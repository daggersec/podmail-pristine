[No Writer Mentioned]

December 11, 2014



PPP's early polling on who Democrats and Republicans in North Carolina
would like as their candidate for President in 2016 finds that 5 different
potential candidates hit double digits on the GOP side, while Hillary
Clinton continues to be the overwhelming choice on the Democratic side.



Ben Carson leads the way for the Republicans with 19% to 15% for Jeb Bush,
14% each for Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee, 11% for Paul Ryan, 7% for
Rick Perry, 5% each for Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and 4% for Marco Rubio.



Carson's name recognition isn't as high as the other Republicans, but among
those familiar with him 47% have a favorable opinion to just 12% with a
negative one. Huckabee (67/17) and Bush (61/17) are also pretty popular
with the Republican base, while feelings toward Christie (42/32) are
considerably more mixed.



On the Democratic side Hillary Clinton continues to be pretty dominant.
She's at 52% to 18% for Joe Biden, 7% for Elizabeth Warren, 5% for Bernie
Sanders, 4% for Andrew Cuomo, 2% for Jim Webb, 1% for Martin O'Malley, and
less than half a percent for Brian Schweitzer.



What's particularly noteworthy in Clinton's numbers is how consistent they
are across various demographic lines. She's at 55% with 'very liberal'
voters, 55% with 'somewhat liberal' ones, and 52% with moderates. She's at
57% with African Americans and 52% with whites. She's at 53% with seniors,
52% with middle aged voters, and 52% with younger voters. The only place
where you see a real divide is along gender lines where she gets 56% with
women and 48% with men.

At least at this very early stage it looks like North Carolina will yet
again be a swing state in 2016 if Clinton is indeed the Democrat nominee.
She is very closely matched with all of her potential Republican opponents,
leading Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie each by 2 points at 46/44 and
44/42 respectively, while tying Bush and Carson at 46% and 44%
respectively. Those numbers show there isn't a big electability difference
between the Republican candidates at least at this point. We also tested
Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren in head to head match ups with Bush and
Carson, and they fare a good bit worse than Clinton. Biden trails Bush
47/42 and Carson 45/40, while Warren trails Bush 46/39 and Carson 44/37.



The only candidates we tested who have a positive net favorability among
the entire electorate in North Carolina are Ben Carson at +12 (31/19) and
Mike Huckabee at +5 (39/34).



It's hard to say how the 2016 election cycle will unfold but North Carolina
was the closest state in the country in the Presidential race in both 2008
and 2012, and early indications are that it has the potential to be pretty
tight once again.

By Anne Gearan and Matea Gold

Hillary Rodham Clinton is considering the nitty-gritty details of how and
when to organize a presidential campaign amid signs that she will postpone
making her shadow campaign official until later in 2015 than expected,
according to advisers and Democratic strategists.



Clinton and her small circle of close advisers are weighing legal advice to
set up a strict firewall between her and the numerous outside groups
backing her presumed 2016 candidacy, according to a person familiar with
the talks. The quarantine would run for a set period of time before she
would announce her candidacy, as a way to make sure that the campaign and
outside groups do not run afoul of federal election rules.



Clinton is also debating whether to establish an exploratory committee =E2=
=80=94 a
placeholder organization that would allow her to raise money to pay for
consultants, office space and other operating expenses. But the move would
trigger financial disclosures she can now avoid, and Clinton is getting a
lot of advice against forming such a committee, two Democratic strategists
said.



An exploratory committee might also appear too coy for a previous candidate
with obvious ambitions for a second try, according to several Democratic
advisers, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because
Clinton has not yet said she is running.



=E2=80=9CAt this point, what would she be exploring?=E2=80=9D one strategis=
t with ties to
Clinton said.



The strategy discussions provide further evidence that the former secretary
of state and first lady is edging closer to another run for the presidency,
after two years writing and promoting a memoir, giving paid speeches and
strengthening ties with key Democratic interest groups. But rather than
announce in January =E2=80=94 as she did in 2007 =E2=80=94 Clinton allies a=
re increasingly
working under the assumption that an official announcement will not come
until spring.



Several potential Republican candidates, including Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) and
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, have also signaled that they plan to wait until
spring or later for a final decision. The only official 2016 candidate so
far is former Virginia senator Jim Webb (D), who formed an exploratory
committee last month.



The enforced separation now under discussion by Clinton and her aides would
erect a clearer legal barrier between her and her unofficial
campaign-in-waiting. It would put an end to the informal discussions now
taking place between Clinton=E2=80=99s inner circle and operatives working =
for
outside groups backing her.



Because Clinton is not a declared candidate for federal office, she and her
advisers are allowed to communicate informally with groups such as
Priorities USA Action, Ready for Hillary and American Bridge, whose Correct
the Record project functions as a rapid-response operation on her behalf.
If and when she announces her bid, however, Clinton=E2=80=99s campaign woul=
d not be
able to share strategic information with allies outside the campaign and
Democratic Party.



Another issue her aides are considering is a Federal Election Commission
rule that requires a 120-day waiting period before an outside group can
make an expenditure on a candidate=E2=80=99s behalf if they have hired a ve=
ndor or
strategist who worked for the candidate=E2=80=99s campaign.



The rule led Restore Our Future, the super PAC that backed Mitt Romney in
the 2012 campaign, to delay running its first ad until 120 days after it
brought former Romney fundraising officials on board.



Priorities and Correct the Record are expected to function as an outside
flanking operation for an official Clinton campaign, organizing and paying
for advertising, research efforts and other activities. Ready for Hillary =
=E2=80=94
which has collected an extensive database of declared supporters and
potential donors for a Clinton 2016 candidacy =E2=80=94 plans to close down=
 if she
announces a bid.



Clinton=E2=80=99s status as an almost universally known political figure an=
d
presumptive front-runner mean that the usual benefits of an exploratory
committee =E2=80=94 including a home address for campaign hiring and fundra=
ising =E2=80=94
are less relevant, some strategists said. She can afford to wait later than
she did during the 2008 cycle and skip the exploratory committee step she
took then, these strategists said.



After announcing an exploratory committee in January 2007, Clinton waited
until September of that year to form the official Hillary Clinton for
President campaign. But there was no real doubt during that time that she
would run, and some Democrats saw the exploratory committee as unnecessary
and excessively cautious.



Barack Obama generated buzz in political circles by largely dispensing with
the exploratory phase. He made what was seen as a bold challenge to Clinton
by replacing his three-week-old exploratory committee in February 2007 with
the official Obama for America campaign.



Clinton has already said she is thinking about another presidential
campaign and that she is likely to make her decision after Jan. 1. She has
given no hints in recent public remarks that she has reached a final
decision or when she might do so.



Clinton has accepted commercial speaking engagements into March that would
be awkward for an official candidate, increasing speculation that she is
postponing an announcement until after that date.



Ready for Hillary has scheduled top-dollar fundraisers through March, on
the assumption that she will not announce before then, according to a
person familiar with the group=E2=80=99s plans.

reported this week. That=E2=80=99s the furthest ahead on the calendar that

Although she could continue to give paid speeches after announcing a
presidential bid, strategists who support her candidacy but are not
advising her directly said she is highly unlikely to do so. It would be
unseemly and open her to criticism for perceived conflicts of interest, the
strategists said.



But other strategists said she could easily cancel speeches booked far in
the future, or forego her usual speaking fee of $250,000 or more. Although
Clinton also makes appearances that do not earn her money, paid speeches =
=E2=80=94

Hillary Clinton is considering the details of how to launch her
presidential bid, with a formal announcement likely to be in spring 2015,
according to The Washington Post.



The Post reports that Clinton and her aides are also considering cutting
off talks with outside groups supporting her ahead of the run. That would
establish a formal barrier because of rules preventing coordination between
a campaign and outside groups.



Clinton is also weighing whether to establish an exploratory committee
ahead of a formal announcement, the Post reports. The newspaper also says
some advisers are arguing Clinton does not need an exploratory committee
because it is unnecessary for such an established candidate.



The reported moves in the Clinton camp are further evidence the likely
Democratic front-runner plans to run, despite her public statements that
she has not made up her mind.



Clinton's scheduling of paid speeches for as late as March has spurred some
doubts, given that she is expected to stop giving paid speeches once she
announces a run. But under the timeline indicated by the Post story, she
appears to be holding off on an announcement until after March.



The more formal barrier between Clinton's inner circle and outside groups
would also put an end to current consultations.



Groups like Ready for Hillary, Priorities USA, and Correct the Record have
been building supporters lists, fundraising and messaging on Clinton's
behalf.



Last month, a number of long-time Clinton advisers gathered in New York at
a Ready for Hillary event to prepare.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, 108th Mayor of New York
City Michael R. Bloomberg, United Nations Foundation President and CEO
Kathy Calvin, and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton will bring
together leading experts for a discussion on the vital role data plays in
closing gender gaps, and how lack of data can inhibit progress for women
and girls globally.



The event will take place Monday, Dec. 15, 2014, at Bloomberg
Philanthropies in New York City.



The event will highlight the work of Data2X =E2=80=93 a partnership launche=

Lloyd Blankfein thinks the economy is on the right track.



"There are a lot of positives to the economy"," the CEO and chairman of
Goldman Sachs said at the DealBook Conference in New York Thursday.



He noted an improving housing market and lower leverage in the system.



On falling oil prices, he said that Europe "should be ecstatic" given their
energy imports. He said the drop in prices was also a positive for the U.S.
economy.



On China, Blankfein said the Asian giant will eventually overtake the U.S.



"Their economy is going to be bigger than our economy even though they're
poorer than us on a per capita basis," he noted.



He said the big question in the U.S. is whether the economy is going to
grow at 2.75 percent or 3.75 percent; in China, the range is 4 percent to 9
percent.



On inversions, Blankfein said tax law should be written in a way that it
doesn't encourage a move just for tax reasons. Now, people are incentivized
to avoid taxes legally; it can't be a patriotic duty to stay in the U.S.



"That kind of pressure is a fact of life" for companies, he said.



Asked about presidential politics, Blankfein hinted he would support
Hillary Clinton.



"I've always been a fan of Hillary Clinton," he said.



Asked about how long he would be CEO of Goldman Sachs, Blankfein said "I
don't think about it. This is what I do."

Bill Clinton already has big plans for his granddaughter, Charlotte Clinton
Mezvinsky!



The former president spoke at Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year
gala this week to honor Little League star pitcher Mo'ne Davis, Magic
Johnson, Pete Frates (who helmed the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge), and
baseball MVP Madison Baumgarner.



During Clinton's speech, he gushed about his dreams of taking little
Charlotte to Cooperstown to learn all about baseball when Chelsea Clinton's
wee one is "old enough to go." What a proud grandpa!



Bill also shared how he's followed Davis' career, and has even tried to get
Hillary Clinton on board.

"I got in a lot of potentially bad habits when Hillary had that traveling
job and I was home alone all the time. I watched all that guy stuff, you
know, sporting events and movies. Hillary was actually impressed that I was
watching a teenage girl throw a baseball. And I said, 'You'd be impressed
too. If you could have done that at her age, you'd be in a different line
of work!'"

Maryland Gov. Martin O=E2=80=99Malley, who is eyeing a 2016 presidential ru=
n, got
out ahead of presumed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by calling
for the prosecution of those involved in the U.S. government=E2=80=99s past=
 use of
torture =E2=80=94 an issue that has been thrust back in spotlight this week
following the release of a landmark Senate report.



Every Democrat considering a run for the presidency is against torture, but
the fault line comes on whether or not officials involved in the
controversial program during the Bush administration should be criminally
prosecuted for their actions. Torture is illegal, and there have been
renewed calls for prosecution following the release of gruesome report.



Former secretary of state Clinton has not spoken out since the release of
the report Tuesday, and her spokesperson did not return a request for
comment, but she has previously ruled out prosecutions for those involved
in the Bush-era program.



=E2=80=9CI didn=E2=80=99t want people to be criminally prosecuted, people w=
ho were doing
what they were told to do, that there were legal opinions supporting what
they were told to do, but I wanted transparency,=E2=80=9D Clinton said at t=
he
Council of Foreign Relations in June.



O=E2=80=99Malley, who as a governor has not said much publicly on foreign p=
olicy in
the past, went further than Clinton Thursday.



In an interview with the New York Times, the governor called for a special
prosecutor to investigate Bush-era officials. =E2=80=9CI hope that the Just=
ice
Department might reconsider and appoint a special prosecutor,=E2=80=9D he s=
aid. =E2=80=9CI
think there needs to be some accountability so that this doesn=E2=80=99t ha=
ppen
again.=E2=80=9D



He added that he saw no circumstances in which the harsh tactics often
called torture are justified: =E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t believe the United S=
tates should
torture =E2=80=A6 Period. Full stop.=E2=80=99=E2=80=99



During the 2008 Democratic primary, then-Sen. Barack Obama attacked
then-Sen. Clinton for at one time supporting a =E2=80=9Cticking time bomb=
=E2=80=9D
exception to her otherwise anti-torture position. Clinton later reversed
her position and ruled out torture in all cases.



O=E2=80=99Malley also said that the harsh interrogation tactics actually =
=E2=80=9Cmakes the
United States more vulnerable to attack=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cmakes it hard=
er for the
United States to lead coalitions and to build coalitions.=E2=80=99=E2=80=99



=E2=80=9COur long-term security interests are not advanced by engaging in t=
orture
and the sort of behavior that runs totally contrary to everything we=E2=80=
=99re
about as a people,=E2=80=99=E2=80=99 he added.



Former Sen. Jim Webb, the only Democrat who has already created a
presidential exploratory committee, seemed to blame the Senate Intelligence
Committee for the failure in a series of Tweets sent Wednesday night.
=E2=80=9CWhere was the Intelligence Committee when the torture was going on=
?=E2=80=9D he
wrote. =E2=80=9CThe question is not torture, but how far Congress has desce=
nded in
its historical oversight role on key issues of foreign policy.=E2=80=9D



A spokesperson for Webb did not respond to a request for comment.



The United Nations, human rights groups, and outgoing Sen. Mark Udall have
all called on President Obama to reopen the possibility of prosecution, but
the president has so far dismissed the idea, saying he doesn=E2=80=99t want=
 to
=E2=80=9Cre-fight old arguments.=E2=80=9D



As he gears up for a potential run in 2016, hiring staffers and traveling
to early presidential primary states, O=E2=80=99Malley has consistently fou=
nd
opportunities to differentiate himself from the White House and Clinton,
staking out positions just to left of either or both. On everything from
immigration, to net neutrality, to fracking, and now torture, O=E2=80=99Mal=
ley has
sought to present himself as a more progressive alternative.



He=E2=80=99s also showcased his record in Maryland, which contains a list o=
f
accomplishments many progressives might find attractive, and has taken
shots at likely GOP presidential candidates.

Have you heard the story of the first-term senator who is a hero to the
party base and the subject of intense 2016 speculation -- the one who's
willing to buck leaders on big bills, and has even lobbied House members to
stand against a funding measure to keep the government running?



It's the story of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). This week, it's also the story of
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).



Warren has emerged as the torchbearer of the liberal resistance on Capitol
Hill to a $1.01 trillion bill to fund the government, which is facing the
threat of a shutdown once again. The last time this happened, it was Cruz
leading a crusade to try to use a spending bill to weaken the federal
health-care law, even if it meant a shutdown, which it did.



There are some striking similarities between Cruz and Warren. There are
also, obviously, some sharp differences. Both have loyal national
followings yearning for them to run for president. Both are still relative
Senate newbies elected in 2012. Both are viewed as leaders on the issues
that move the political left and right, respectively.



But one key distinction is how far they are willing to push their
opposition efforts. Another is how they are viewed by party leaders.



While Cruz launched a marathon anti-Obamacare filibuster on the Senate
floor in 2013 and built enough support for his cause to actually shut down
the government temporarily, there is no evidence yet that Warren is willing
to go quite that far.



Asked repeatedly during a press conference Wednesday whether she would
block the funding bill on the Senate floor, Warren repeatedly sidestepped
the questions, insisting that her pressure was aimed squarely at the lower
chamber to ensure the bill doesn't ever make it to the Senate in its
current form.



"Right now, the fight is in the House," said Warren, who was flanked by
several House Democrats. "That's the fight we are going to pursue."



Indeed, Cruz has used similar tactics. He whipped votes against House
Speaker John A. Boehner's border bill earlier this year.



Such brazen opposition is part of the reason Cruz has earned many GOP
critics, even as conservative activists embrace him as royalty. Warren has
not drawn that level of resentment from leading Democrats -- at least, not
yet.



There are no signs that she is bickering with party leadership in
Washington the way Cruz has sparred with GOP leaders. And part of her
populist message has been embraced, at least in general terms, by Hillary
Clinton, the Democratic Party's presumed presidential frontrunner.



Warren's opposition to the spending bill lies in a provision that makes a
key change to the landmark "Dodd-Frank" law designed to police Wall Street
banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The bill would ease some
risk for the banks by reversing a requirement that some derivatives trading
fall into separate units that do not have access to deposit insurance.



Economic populism is precisely the reason Warren is so well-liked in her
party right now. Her growing influence is a testament to rising concerns
among Democrats about income inequity, regulation of Wall Street banks, the
minimum wage and the notion that not everyone is getting a fair shake.



And so, much like Cruz, Warren's reputation is built on resistance. Her
central cause has been ensuring Wall Street banks don't abuse their power
at the expense of everyday consumers. Cruz's fight has been against the
Obama administration, which he has accused of overreaching in many ways.



But it is the extent of that resistance that could ultimately distinguish
the two from one another. Even if he hasn't made much noise so far this
month, Cruz has shown in the past he is willing to go all out for his
causes -- damn the torpedoes. Warren's tipping point will be tested this
week, with many Democrats urging colleagues to pass the spending bill and
avoid yet another last-minute conflict.



Rep. James P. Moran (D-Va.), who enthusiastically supports the bill, told
The Washington Post it is about as good a deal as Democrats may see for a
while, with Republicans set to assume control of both chambers of Congress.



"I'm telling Democrats they should take what they can get while they can
get it," said Moran, who was one of 70 Democrats who voted last year for
the Dodd-Frank change Warren opposes.



The House is expected to vote on the bill later Thursday. If it passes, it
will go to the Senate. And we'll learn soon whether Warren's Senate path
will follow the Cruz roadmap or not.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will meet with progressives in the early voting
state of Iowa next week as speculation mounts that he=E2=80=99ll launch a p=
rimary
challenge to Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton.



Sanders will deliver the keynote speech at a Progress Iowa dinner on Tuesda=
y in
Altoona, where he=E2=80=99ll focus on wealth inequality and his economic ag=
enda to
rebuild the middle class.



Sanders will also meet with labor unions, environmentalists, women=E2=80=99=
s rights
groups, immigration reform activists and other progressive groups.



Potential presidential candidates from both parties are flocking to Iowa,
where a strong showing at the unpredictable first-in-the-nation caucuses
can propel a candidate deep into the primaries. President Obama defeated
Clinton in the caucuses in 2008, fueling an underdog candidacy that ended
in the White House.



Clinton is far and away the Democratic front-runner. A CNN-ORC poll from
late November showed Clinton leading the field of Democrats at 65 percent.
Sanders came in a distant fourth behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and
Vice President Biden.



Still, progressive groups are clamoring for a liberal alternative to
Clinton, and Sanders could fill that role. MoveOn.org is trying to draft
Warren, but the Massachusetts Democrat has said she has no intention of
running for president.
