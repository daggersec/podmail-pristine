John,<br>
<br>
Per our conversation with Mike Froman, Christine and I are preparing to set up the 10 teams we will use for the private record vet or deep dive with a goal of having the teams in place by Monday, October 13. We&#39;d like to start reaching out to potential team leaders as early as tomorrow, but we think it is important to first touch base with Jim Hamilton to communicate our decision to use internal resources to manage the process. We can communicate with Jim, but we thought you might want the option of contacting him given your previous meeting. We are very interested in Jim leading and putting together the team of lawyers who would focus on vetting candidates for Secretary of State. We also would be open to him providing general advice as we move forward. We plan to reach out to Leslie Kiernan and Bill Taylor to be team leads, too. Please let me know if you will reach out to Jim.<br>
