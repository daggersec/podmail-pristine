Here are the Afghanistan numbers in the ABC-Washington Post poll that didn't
make page 1:

The Afghanistan numbers are all bad for McCain -- see the* 9-point net swing
*on "worth fighting" for Afghanistan.

There's also the "is US military action succeeding in Afghanistan" question
-- comparing 10/02 vs 07/08 shows a *net 53-point swing. *

While Bush and McCain been focusing on Iraq, things have gotten worse in
Afghanistan. Although McCain said we could "muddle through" and "next up
Baghdad," casualties in Afghanistan surpassed those in Iraq last month

Poll Finds Voters Split on Candidates' Iraq-Pullout Positions

By Jonathan Weisman and Jon Cohen
Washington Post Staff Writers
Tuesday, July 15, 2008; Page A01

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds the country split down the middle
between those backing Sen. Barack Obama's 16-month timeline for withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Iraq and those agreeing with Sen. John McCain's position
that events, not timetables, should dictate when forces come home.

Obama, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, will deliver what
his campaign is billing as a "major address" on Iraq today in Washington,
part of an effort to convince voters that he could serve effectively as
commander in chief. The public is also evenly divided on that question, with
48 percent saying he would be an effective leader of the military and 48
percent saying he would not.

On Iraq policy in general, Americans continue to side with Obama and McCain,
his Republican rival, in roughly equal numbers, with 47 percent of those
polled saying they trust McCain more to handle the war, and 45 percent
having more faith in Obama.

The poll results suggest that months of Democratic attacks on McCain's Iraq
position have not dented voters' basic trust in his ability to lead the
country's armed forces: Seventy-two percent said McCain would make a good
commander in chief.

"The most important number by Election Day is whether a majority of the
electorate has achieved a comfort level with Obama as commander in chief,"
said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster who was a strategist for Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign, and who considers Obama's 48
percent a strong starting position. "I think this is the one dimension on
which he will be tested and where Republicans will try hard to raise big
doubts about Obama."

David Axelrod, Obama's chief strategist, said of the candidate's standing:
"This is not a particularly new or unusual finding. People believe the war
was a mistake. They believe we should leave. And they want it done in a
deliberate, thoughtful way."

The polling data underscore why the two campaigns are fighting the war over
the war so fiercely. Ahead of today's speech and a planned trip to Iraq,
Obama wrote an opinion article in yesterday's New York Times, saying that
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's call last week for a withdrawal
timetable is an opportunity the United States must embrace.

"Only by redeploying our troops can we press the Iraqis to reach
comprehensive political accommodation and achieve a successful transition to
Iraqis' taking responsibility for the security and stability of their
country," Obama wrote, pledging that he would stick to his plan to begin the
withdrawal of one to two combat brigades per month upon taking office.

The Times commentary drew a furious response from the McCain campaign, with
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) calling it "an unbelievably brazen effort by
a politician to rewrite history." He accused Obama of building "a political
strategy around losing" the war.

Republicans were not alone in that response. Michael E. O'Hanlon, a
Democratic defense analyst at the Brookings Institution who has been an
outspoken supporter of the war in Iraq, said he could not believe that Obama
would put such a definitive timeline into print before a trip to Iraq, where
he is to consult with Iraqi leaders and U.S. commanders.

"To say you're going to get out on a certain schedule -- regardless of what
the Iraqis do, regardless of what our enemies do, regardless of what is
happening on the ground -- is the height of absurdity," said O'Hanlon, who
described himself as "livid." "I'm not going to go to the next level of
invective and say he shouldn't be president. I'll leave that to someone
else."

Susan E. Rice, a senior Obama foreign policy adviser, snapped back, calling
McCain's position "fundamentally disconnected from reality."

The recent decline in attacks on U.S. forces and in overall violence in Iraq
has done nothing to convince Americans that the war has been worth fighting.
Sixty-three percent said it has not been worth its costs, a figure that has
changed little over the past two years. But 46 percent now say the United
States is making significant progress toward restoring civil order there, an
uptick from 40 percent in April.

Even so, public views on Iraq stand in stark contrast to those about the
conflict in Afghanistan. A narrow majority -- 51 percent -- said that the
war there has been worth fighting. And 51 percent also said the United
States must win in Afghanistan to succeed in the broader terrorism battle, a
sharp contrast to the 34 percent who said the same thing about the war in
Iraq. Nevertheless, some of the shine has come off U.S. efforts in
Afghanistan as well.

Forty-four percent now say U.S. military action against the Taliban and
al-Qaeda in Afghanistan has been successful, down from 70 percent in October
2002, a year after allied forces went to war there.

Such sentiment ratifies Obama's pledge to begin withdrawing forces from Iraq
immediately and to shift at least two combat brigades to Afghanistan, to
"re-center our foreign policy," as Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) put it
yesterday.

Biden said the Bush administration's war policies, most of which McCain has
backed, "have made us weaker than in any time in modern history." Four
recent events have underscored how urgently Obama's prescriptions are
needed, he added. Commanders in the field and in the Pentagon have begun to
say publicly that forces that are urgently needed in Afghanistan are tied
down in Iraq. The Maliki government has refused to sign any long-term
agreement on the future of U.S. forces in Iraq without a withdrawal
timeline. U.S. military commanders there are growing more confident that
Iraq's military will be ready to assume control of the country by next year.
And al-Qaeda and the Taliban have regrouped and grown stronger in the
largely ungoverned tribal regions of western Pakistan and eastern
Afghanistan.

"Senator Obama's got it profoundly right," said Biden, the chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Randy Scheunemann, the McCain campaign's top foreign policy aide, noted that
Biden championed the idea of dividing Iraq into three semi-autonomous
regions: Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish. "If we had followed Senator Biden's
ill-informed advice to split Iraq into three pieces, we would have seen
wide-scale civil war," he said.

Americans are divided on which candidate has a plan for success in the
region. Exactly half of those polled said they backed Obama's plan to
withdraw most U.S. forces from Iraq within 16 months of taking office. But
49 percent sided with McCain's position of opposing a specific timetable and
letting events dictate when troops should be withdrawn. Among independents,
who will be the key voting bloc in November, 53 percent oppose Obama's
timeline.

"The American people are very conflicted on how to go forward, whether or
not they thought we should've gone in there," said Jeremy Rosner, a
Democratic pollster. "And for good reasons. They understand there are
difficult consequences in terms of our interests in the region and our
interests abroad."

This is the first time the Post-ABC poll has squared the two candidates'
withdrawal plans against each other. In previous polls, a majority of
Americans (55 percent in June) put a priority on withdrawal even without
civil order in Iraq.

The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone July 10 to 13 among a random
national sample of 1,119 adults, and has a margin of sampling error of plus
or minus three percentage points.
