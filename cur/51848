*BIG HIGHLIGHTS: *

   - Says he's seen courage and overcoming adversity too
   - Says he's been proud to count myself a friend to the cause of equal
   opportuinty to all Americans

   the legislation because we have to be able to pay for it
   - Evades question about SCOTUS narrowing ADA definitions into
   strict-constructionist pitch
   - Promises to call Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to fix SS, etc.

Columbus, OH (via satellite): McCain Remarks to American Association of
People with Disabilities  07/26/08
*(Disclaimer: The following are notes, not direct quotes. If you'd like a
quotable transcript or video of any part below, please email us.)*

Speech Highlights

   - Judy Woodruff gives introductory remarks
      - Announces McCain appears from Cottonwood via satellite, near his
      home in AZ
      - his wife, Cindy, taught special ed.
      - participated in Title 4 legislation
      - helped lead efforts to help voting for people with disabilities
      - has led effort in helping get care disabled vets
   - McCain thanks Judy Woodruff
   - Remembers Jeff (singer) being at signing of ADA, that important signing
   where Americans GOP and Dems came together to fulfill promise of our
   forefathers that all are created equal
   - (reads from car) acknowledge Chairman of board and Maj. Dade
   - *mention to technicians that i'm hearing an echo and it's
   disconcerting- some of us in this business are familiar. i'm sure our crack
   technicians will figure it out.*
   - many thousands of votes wouldn't have been cast at all if it weren't
   for this org's Disability Vote Project - it doesnt mean much to have the
   right to vote if you're overlooked in registraiton, or can't use the
   machines or get to the polling booth - you've overcome a lot of obstacles, a
   lot still not overcome
   - when people with disabilities are excluded, it's an injustice to them
   and to America
   - AADP holds America to its own ideals - expand promise of America to
   more people
   - *along the way i've been proud to count myself a friend to the cause of
   equal opportuinty to all Americans*, w/ or w/o disability
   - usually these reforms laws established were standards of fairness:
      - access to phones for hearing-impaired
      - open up job opportunities
      - made schools more amenable to people with disabilities
      - expanded Medicaid to be more helpful for work and self-sufficiency
      - when a monument to FDR was erected, the greatness of the man was in
      his chair
   - ADA has been one of the most important and  I was a co-sponsor - more
   needs to be done
   - in re-authorization of ADA, we must remove all doubt that hte law is
   intended to protect all against discrimination for physical and mental
   disabilities and we must clarify the definition of a disability to insure
   full protection of those it was meant ot serve
   - I supported the 2008 House ADA bill, I will suppport a similar in the
   Senate
   - disabilities shouldn't mean the absence of choice - the govt shouldn't
   be heavy-handed and restrict personal freedom.* I'll work for legislation
   that builds on the principles of the money-follows-the-person initiative
   while also keeping to a responsible budget*
   - living with a disability should not mean confinement to an
   institutional setting - i want to increase choices, expand freedom and open
   doors
   - *every POTUS brings his or her own experiences to the office - I've
   seen courage and overcoming adversity* in war, in prison camps and in
   military hospitals
   - how we face such obstacles can define our lives and how we support them
   is how we can define our country



   - WOODRUFF: Thank you. I know you can't see us but there is a room of
   individuals active in the disabilities community and they are hanging on
   your every word



   - 1Q) If you're elected President, what would your main interest be in
   strengthening response of V.A. to needs of vets wounded particularly from
   Iraq and Afghanistan.
      - MCCAIN: Quotes George Washington - important to treat vets well.
      V.A. is a great place with great people - we can't allow Walter
Reed scandal
      to happen again. We need to treat the wounds both seen and
unseen. PTSD is a
      big deal.  We need to relieve the burden on the V.A. for routine health
      care. We should give vets a plastic card to go their own doctor.
   - FOLLOWUP: How do we pay for this? How do we prioritize spending?
   - MCCAIN: Spending has gotten out of control. It's led to corruption of
      Congress. Congress doesn't act in people's interests, acts in parochial
      interests. We need to scrub the parts of government that don't
work. We need
      to cut out pork-barrel spending. We are spending DOD money that we could
      devote to vets' spending. We need a line-item veto so we aren't wasting
      money on researching bear DNA or bridge to nowhere. I'm happy to tell you
      we're spending more money this year than last year. We can find
ways to do
      that. *We can take care of vets' needs first and then eliminate the
      wasteful spending. We need to prioritize so we put their needs first*.



   - 2Q) long-term care. You said you didn't support the idea of Community
   Choice but now I believe you're saying you support it. Help us understand.
      - MCCAIN: *I support the concept. This legislation that is there - I
      am not in support of. *I believe that the majority of Americans - the
      longer they can stay in a home setting over institutionalized care, they
      prefer that. There are many that wouldn't prefer it, but we
found there are
      many that do. Here in AZ our program is called ACCESS.  We have
provided for
      people to stay at home as long as possible. There's a pilot
program that's
      working called cash-in counseling, where the money is given to the
      individual and the individual can make the choice themselves. The
      individuals are best able to make these decisions, not the
government. And I
      think most Americans would rather remain in their homes as long
as possible.
      - FOLLOWUP: What is it in the legislation that you don't support?
      - MCCAIN: The primary thing is that we have to pay for them. We passed
      *the Prescription Drug Act *and we needed to make sure people didn't
      have to choose between paying for their prescriptions or eating
their next
      meal. We didn't have a way to fund it - *We need to not lay another
      trillion-dollar burden in unfunded liability*, i.e. debt, on the next
      generation. *Of course we can pay for it but we need to cut out the
      wasteful spending.*



   - 3Q) Where do you come down on the SCOTUS rulings that narrow the
   definitions in ADA?
      - MCCAIN: The problem isn't the SCOTUS - the problem is the way we
      wrote the legislation. The job of the SCOTUS isn't to make laws, it is to
      follow the Constitution. So *I put the blame right back on us.* The
      SCOTUS should strictly follow the Constitution. If one branch of
govt starts
      doing the job of other branches, that's a two-edged sword. Let's
not blame
      the courts for our work not being what it should be.



   - 4Q) Social Security / Federal income support programs. SSI and SSDI:
   Should these be reformed so beneficiaries can enjoy better SOLs and so
   they're not penalized if they earn more? And put it in the context of helath
   care reform over all.
      - MCCAIN: We disincentivize Americans from going back to work. And a
      job is more than a job. When we reformed Welfare, it was a big
step. So we
      should look at how these programs incenitivize people and also if they're
      providing sufficient care so Americans can live decent lives. And SS is
      going broke. "And *I hate to sound like a Johnny-One-Note here,"* but
      we need to sit down together in bipartisan fashion and
acknowledge that we
      know that money is not going to be there, so we can reform SS and all the
      programs that go along with it--retirement is only one part of
it--and make
      sure it's still going to be there.
      - As POTUS, *I promise I will call up Reid and Pelosi and say we have
      to fix this together. *I have always put my country first, ranging
      from a time when I refused an offer to go home early and I have worked
      across the aisle.
   - I'm proud of my work on ADA, which is not just a landmark but a
      fulfillment of rights.



   - WOODRUFF: On behalf of everyone here, we appreciate you joining us from
   part of your busy schedule.

incenitivize people and also if they&#39;re providing sufficient care so

but we need to sit down together in bipartisan fashion and acknowledge
that we know that money is not going to be there, so we can reform SS
and all the programs that go along with it--retirement is only one part
of it--and make sure it&#39;s still going to be there.</li><li>As POTUS, <b>I promise I will call up Reid and Pelosi and say we have to fix this together. </b>I
have always put my country first, ranging from a time when I refused an
offer to go home early and I have worked across the aisle.</li></ul><ul><li>I&#39;m proud of my work on ADA, which is not just a landmark but a fulfillment of rights.&nbsp;</li></ul></ul><div><br></div><ul><li>WOODRUFF:&nbsp;On behalf of everyone here, we appreciate you joining us from part of your busy schedule.</li>
