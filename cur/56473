Thanks - will review the timeline.

I think the key for her is understanding; once she does, she moves fast.
So the question I would ask would be is it possible to do the briefings you
set out in the earlier email first so that before she goes right to who
will be the folks, she has a chance to have her own inate feel for what she
needs b/c she had the learning she needs to rely on her informed knowledge
and instincts in addition to resting into the judgment of others.  That is
when she is at her best (think how she is doing the policy process - get
good evidence, data, information and then act).

Will look at the sked and revert.

best.
