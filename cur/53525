Everything has been fine, except that we missed you and Mary. We went on an=
other boat ride with Chuck and Nancy Parrish. Bob Solow joined us. Lots of =
fun. He had a great line on the Greek situation which I will forward to you=
 separately. Also had dinner with Skip, his daughter and her fianc=E9e. He =
thinks you're great. Today-dominos. We won't be calling you for the rules.

Happy to meet with Terisita. I'm back in the office next week. OK to give h=
er my contact info.

How are you doing?

Thanks so much for the prompt reply, John! And the minute you tell us to sh=
ow up, we will be in Truckee. No questions asked :)

I would also love to connect with Herb Sandler. He would be a fascinating p=
erson to talk to. Let me know how I can facilitate that introduction.

I went ahead and drafted a short email to Lisa, and I attached my resume. L=
et me know if you don=92t have her email over at Apple and I can work on tr=
acking it down.

Thanks again for all your help!

Best,
Teresita

Hi Lisa,

I hope you are doing well and are enjoying your time in California.

I wanted to introduce you to a friend and colleague of mine, Teresita Perez=
. Teresita was my speechwriter at the Center for American Progress where sh=
e excelled in writing complex policy speeches on climate, immigration, and =
poverty alleviation, among other issues. She recently moved to the Bay Area=
 and she is interested in working for a company investing in progressive so=
cial initiatives, and she has a keen interest in mobile payments and financ=
ial inclusion. I immediately thought she would benefit from a conversation =
with you, particularly as you build out your new office.

By way of background, after she left CAP, Teresita served as a speechwriter=
 and policy adviser to Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis, then went to Georget=
own Law and, she is currently working remotely as an attorney for the World=
 Bank, where she is focused on reducing fraud and corruption on Bank-financ=
ed projects.

I have cc=92ed Teresita on this email and attached her resume. I hope you t=
wo can connect soon.

John

Hi John,

I hope this finds you well and that you're feeling energized by being back =

Pav and I are now back in California and I am reaching out to folks in the =
private sector. I had a great conversation with Sarah Wartell about my inte=
rest in financial inclusion and she put me in touch with a few very helpful=
 contacts. I recently learned that Lisa Jackson has been named the new head=

Thank you so much for your help - and please let me know when you're in the=
 Bay Area. We'd love to see you!
