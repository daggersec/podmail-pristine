Dear Friend of Disability Rights:



IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SPONSORED ME IN THE ADAPT FUN RUN - A SINCERE THANK 
YOU!!!!!  MANY, MANY OF THE ADAPT FOLKS ARE ON SSI AND CANNOT AFFORD TO GO 
TO D.C. TO ADVOCATE FOR ALL DISABLED PEOPLE.



AND PLEASE IGNORE THE REST OF THIS E-MAIL!  YOU DO NOT HAVE

TO SPONSOR ME AGAIN.



For Everybody Else:



You are getting this e-mail because the ADAPT FUN RUN computer ate my last

FUN RUN link and I had to reregister and get a new link and FUN RUN 
number.

Here is the new one:

http://adaptfunrun.net/runner/message/217


Yogi Berra said it best:  It is like dij` vu all over again!  Or, like NPR 
says, we cannot end our appeal for sponsors until we raise enough money so 
the ADAPT action in May can be paid for!

Just like NPR asks for your support for the news it reports, I too ask for 
your support FOR ADAPT (all of your contribution goes to ADAPT) for the 
Information Bulletins.

I ask for your support so that the ADAPT folks can represent us and
advocate for us in D.C. during the first week in May, 2014.  They are a
really important disability grassroots presence that must be heard and seen
by the powers in D.C.

I am supporting Philly and National ADAPT to raise funds to continue our
mutual struggle for full implementation of the ADA and total community
integration for all.

I would appreciate your support which you can show by clicking on the above
link of this

e-mail.  Your donation is tax deductible and will go for disability rights
and services advocacy.

We have come a long way but we still have work to do.



Please join me in supporting this campaign for civil, human and disability
rights .



For a Barrier and Institution Free America,



Steve Gold
