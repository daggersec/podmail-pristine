I Am Thankful for Those Who Have the =E2=80=9CCathedral  Builder=E2=80=99s =
Mentality=E2=80=9D=20

I first got involved in politics in the 1960=E2=80=99s as part of the Civil=
  Rights=20
movement. At the time, we thought that in short order progressive values  w=
ould=20
triumph =E2=80=93 that our careers would be spent passing initiatives like =
 universal=20
health care, creating a truly democratic society where every kid had =20
unlimited educational and economic opportunity, and ending war as a means o=
f =20
resolving human disputes. =20
Instead, it turned out that most of us have spent the last four decades =20
defending progressive values and institutions against a resurgent right-win=
g  that=20
energized and re-mobilized the forces of privilege and the status  quo.=20
Lord knows I am thankful this Thanksgiving Day that this period of =20
retrenchment has finally come to an end =E2=80=93 that we are poised once a=
gain to make =20
fundamental progressive change in America.  Most Americans have not been al=
ive =20
during a period when Progressives were on the offensive --   when progressi=
ve=20
values were  ascendant.  Barack Obama=E2=80=99s victory,  coupled with the =
complete=20
failure of the right-wing agenda, make that possible  once again.  I am tru=
ly=20
thankful  that we are on the verge of a new progressive era in America.=20
But history is not some independent force that carries us along like  corks=
=20
in a stream.  People  make history.  We will decide by our  actions whether=
 the=20
next ten or twenty or fifty years will be remembered as a  period of=20
extraordinary progress and possibility, or whether our children will  write=
 that we=20
failed to seize this great historic  opportunity.=20
Of course the fact that we find ourselves at this historic moment was not =
=20
inevitable.  We have been afforded  this opportunity because of the labors =
of=20
millions of people who did battle  before us. We stand on their shoulders. =
Many=20
of them never got to see real  progress, but they battled on anyway.  They =
had=20
what we all need -- the =E2=80=9Ccathedral builder=E2=80=99s  mentality.=E2=
=80=9D=20
During the Middle Ages, whole generations worked to build the great =20
cathedrals of Europe without ever seeing their  completion.  They did their=
 portion =20
of a great multi-generational project.  =20
Today we should give thanks for the many progressive activists, and =20
political leaders who have labored for decades but =E2=80=93 like Moses =E2=
=80=93 didn=E2=80=99t get to =20
cross into the Promised Land.  There  were famous ones: people like Senator=
 Paul=20
Wellstone and Senator Paul  Simon.  There were political  consultants like =
the=20
great Paul Tully.  =20
But, of course the real heroes were the thousands of unsung progressive =20
political activists who built their section of the cathedral wall, or put  =
pains=20
of glass in the windows, but aren=E2=80=99t around to see how the cathedral=
 looks =20
today.  People most of us never  heard of like my friends UAW Region IV Sen=
ior=20
Citizen Coordinator Milt Shraeder,  or Jerry Prete who lead the senior citi=
zens=E2=80=99=20
movement in Illinois for decades.  =20
And we should also give thanks that many of those who have labored for  yea=
rs=20
will =E2=80=93 in fact =E2=80=93 be able to  watch Barack Obama put his han=
d on the Bible in=20
January, and experience that  moment of victory and all it could mean for t=
he=20
future of our planet. People  like Alice Tregay, who worked tirelessly for=
=20
decades to register African  Americans to vote all over America.  People li=
ke=20
Harvey Mader, who is now in  his 80=E2=80=99s. Harvey  worked for every pro=
gressive=20
cause imaginable, including the campaigns of his  great friend Paul Wellsto=
ne. =20
Harvey  was devastated when Paul and Sheila Wellstone died in that plane cr=
ash=20
six years  ago.  But he followed Wellstone=E2=80=99s  dictum: Stand Up, Kee=
p  Fighting.=20
For the many  people like Harvey and Alice this election and the opportunit=
y=20
it gives us puts  the lie to the cynicism of the neigh-sayers.  It has=20
validated their work, their  commitment and their faith in the future.=20
I personally talked to dozens of African  Americans who took pictures of=20
their deceased parents or grandparents with them  to vote on November 4th. =
 They=20
wanted the people who came before them to join them =E2=80=93 to witness =
=E2=80=93  at least=20
symbolically =E2=80=93 their vote to make an African American President of =
the  United =20
States. =20
After all, the =E2=80=9Ccathedral builder=E2=80=99s mentality=E2=80=9D is r=
ooted in something  very=20
ephemeral: hope.  Everyday life  doesn=E2=80=99t always reinforce the notio=
n that we=20
will ultimately succeed at the great  multi-generational project of creatin=
g a=20
truly democratic society. It=E2=80=99s been  pretty easy to lose faith in t=
hat=20
possibility =E2=80=93 especially through the darkest  moments of the last 4=
0 years.  =20
To keep hope alive, periodically you have to experience some  success.  =20
That is probably the most important thing for which I give thanks this =20
holiday.  More than anything else,  this year will be remembered as a time =
when=20
hope was reborn in America: when the triumph of  improbable possibility sen=
t a=20
message to every child, of every color, all over  the world, that anything =
is in=20
fact  possible if we make it so. =20
So as my friend Brad Woodhouse would say: we have a lot to say grace over =
=20
this Thanksgiving. Time to praise the Lord, and pass the potato  salad.=20
