Hi John --

How fortuitous that I turned to walk up 14th Street and bumped into you.
I'm going to keep this short because this is such a busy time for you. I
thought the roll out event on Roosevelt Island looked and sounded
great.  I'm at UCLA, teaching constitutional law and legislative
process/statutory interpretation in both the Political Science Department
and the Law School.  I'm not teaching this summer, so I'm going to attempt
to amp up my academic credentials by doing some research and writing,
possibly for a project on my other former boss, Robert C. Byrd.  But I'm
free to do whatever else I want.  With this email, I'm registering my
support for the Clinton campaign, and most particularly, to indicate my
willingness to help you out, either on the West Coast, or elsewhere.  On an
adjunct professor's salary, I can't personally contribute money, but I can
certainly help raise it, or contribute on the policy side of things.  Let
me know what I might be able to do to help you.

One quick favor.  I saw Steve Ricchetti at the funeral and he promised to
assist with this as well. I came to DC for the funeral late Friday night
and went up to Wilmington early Saturday morning. I was in touch with Ted
Kaufman and people in the VP's office, but for obvious reasons, at the
service, I was not able to see the VP or any members of the Biden family
and I wasn't able to sign the memorial book because it had been taken away
when we came out of the church.  I would just like to be able to send Joe
and Jill a personal card and note that they would actually see and that
would not get lost in the general White House mail. Any ideas on how to
accomplish that would be much appreciated.

I'm back in LA tomorrow night.  I hope we'll stay in touch -- all my
contact information is below. Tell Tony I said hello.

Best,
Cindy
