LCV Names Prop. 23 to 2010 Dirty Dozen, Reaches $1M in Campaign Contributio=
ns to Pro-Environment Candidates, Releases New Political TV Ads

WASHINGTON, DC - Today, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), which work=
s to turn environmental values into national priorities, announced the unpr=
ecedented addition of a ballot measure-California's Proposition 23-to the 2=
010 Dirty Dozen list, released two new political TV ads and reported that t=
he organization has contributed or raised more than $1,000,000 for pro-envi=
ronment congressional candidates this cycle.

"Our members are fired up - and angry - about the fact that Big Oil's congr=
essional allies have blocked action on comprehensive energy reform that cre=
ates jobs, makes America more energy independent and reduces
harmful carbon pollution," said LCV President Gene Karpinski. "We are
continuing to ramp up efforts and mobilize our supporters to defeat the dir=
ty
energy measure in California, re-elect House members who voted for comprehe=
nsive energy and climate legislation and defeat climate change
deniers running against Senate clean energy champions."=A0=A0

LCV and the California LCV announced the unprecedented addition of ballot m=
easure Proposition 23 to the 2010 Dirty Dozen list. For the first time, LCV=
 named the dirty energy measure to its trademark Dirty Dozen program, which=
 traditionally targets candidates for Congress, based on the grave threat P=
rop. 23 poses to California's landmark air pollution standards and growing =
clean energy industry. LCV and its sister organization, LCV Education Fund =
have contributed over $1.2 million so far to defeat this measure, which has=
 been funded largely by Texas oil companies.

"If Big Oil successfully repeals=A0California's clean energy law, there's n=
o doubt that these dirty energy interests will step up their efforts to sti=
fle new energy policies in Congress and in other states - and that's why LC=
V is working with
California LCV to mobilize our members in California and around the country=
," said Karpinski.

LCV and CLCV are working to defeat this dirty energy proposition through CL=
CV's No on 23 ballot measure committee. The addition of Prop. 23 makes this=
 cycle's Dirty Dozen a baker's dozen. The full list can be found at http://=
action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DhuZGf6svXo6zB5G68G7tEg.. .

At this point in the election cycle, LCV Action Fund has contributed or rai=
sed $1,010,429 for pro-environment congressional candidates. By comparison,=
 LCV Action Fund contributed or raised $850,420 during the entire 2008 elec=
tion cycle, while in 2006 the organization contributed or raised $573,261. =
As of October 14th, LCV Action Fund had contributed $315,524 to House and S=
enate candidates, while raising an additional $691,904 for candidates throu=
gh its GiveGreen program. The GiveGreen website, http://action.lcv.org/site=
/R?i=3D1Ff9mbC-qKyrDS6bcsFJqA.. , is the only bundling website devoted excl=
usively to raising money for environmental champions and candidates.

The candidates who have received at least $20,000 from LCV Action Fund's fu=
ndraising efforts* this cycle are:

Senate Candidates
Robin Carnahan (MO) $63,053.56
Barbara Boxer (CA) $58,977.93
Harry Reid (NV) $58,008.17
Michael Bennet (CO) $44,948.51
Paul Hodes (NH) $44,724.18
Joe Sestak (PA) $39,961.41
Russ Feingold (WI) $34,864.85
Patty Murray (WA) $30,381.74
Alexi Giannoulias (IL) $21,536.16

House Candidates
Tom Perriello (VA-05) $51,941.42

Mark Schauer (MI-07) $23,789.48
John Boccieri (OH-16) $22,955.18

* Figures include direct contributions from LCV Action Fund and money raise=
d via LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen program for candidates.

LCV launched two new political TV ads today targeting candidates seeking to=
 replace conservation and clean energy champions this November. A $200,000,=
 Western Slope broadcast and cable ad buy in Colorado hits Senate candidate=
 Ken Buck for his previous support for Referendum A, a
water grab that sought to take water from rural Colorado for corporate
interests and was overwhelmingly rejected by Colorado voters. A $200,000 ad=
 buy in Nevada's 3rd district hits House candidate Joe Heck for his opposit=
ion to creating clean energy jobs in Nevada and will be running in the Las =
Vegas media market. View the ads here:

Buck (CO-Sen): http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DQekbVPdsWvGYwW9zaV7pRA..
Heck (NV-3): http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Dwh0ecYD9pxJDOUfTsZ-YIw..

LCV is making over a half million calls into 20 districts on behalf of Hous=
e members who voted for the American Clean Energy & Security Act, including=
: Grijalva (AZ-07), Markey (CO-04), Perlmutter (CO-7), Himes (CT-04), Boyd =
