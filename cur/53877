There's a chart at the link illustrating how many more jobs will be created=
 by progressive proposals than the ideas being advanced by the folks at Her=

Progressive Infrastructure Investment Creates Six Times As Many Jobs As Con=
servative Proposals<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/01/13/progressiv=
e-investment/>


Last week, the Heritage Foundation released its proposed economic stimulus =
plan<http://www.heritage.org/Research/Economy/wm2191.cfm>. It contained two=
 parts: extend the Bush tax cuts as far into the future as possible and cut=
 taxes across the board for individuals, businesses and corporations throug=
h 2013.

These measures - like those proposed by other conservative organizations li=
ke the Club for Growth<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/01/05/club-ta=
x-cuts/> - are woefully ineffective at offering immediate and substantial s=
timulus when compared with other, progressive alternatives. A new analysis =
by the Center for American Progress Action Fund finds that the Heritage Fou=
ndation's conservative proposals have far less job creating potential than =
progressive proposals of the same magnitude.

 Heritage Proposal Analysis<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/up=
loads/2009/01/heritage-jobs-per-10-billion.gif>

As Matt Yglesias wrote of the Heritage proposal, "this plan would deliver n=
othing to those in the greatest need and would stimulate demand in the leas=
t-efficient way possible. All in pursuit of the right-wing's never-ending g=
oal of further enriching the richest<http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/arch=
ives/2009/01/heritage_the_country_needs_more_bushism.php>."

Every $10 billion in taxpayer money that goes towards extending the Bush ta=
x cuts would create or save just 10,000 jobs versus nearly 60,000 jobs whic=
h could be created or saved by extending unemployment benefits and food sta=
mps (stimulating demand<http://www.cbpp.org/1-9-09bud.htm> for goods and se=
rvices) or investing directly in energy, transportation and education infra=
structure.

As has been extensively<http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8932/1-22-Testim=
onyEconStimulus.htm> documented<http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/testimo=
ny/2008/Zandi1119081.pdf>, the most effective way to close the GDP gap<http=
://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/more-stimulus-notes/> and lay a fou=
ndation for long run growth is by getting money into the hands of people wh=
o are most likely to spend it (struggling families), helping to shore up st=
ate budgets to prevent service cuts and property tax hikes, and through dir=
ect investment by the federal government. What we don't need is simply more=
 tax cuts for corporations<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/01/05/clu=
b-tax-cuts/> and the wealthy<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/01/07/m=
cconnell-middle-class/>.

Methodology notes after the jump.

Job estimates are based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, GDP mu=
ltipliers from Moody's Economy.com, 2009 GDP estimates from the CBO, and a =
conservative application of Okun's law, which projects a 1 percent decrease=
 in unemployment for each 3 percent increase in GDP.
