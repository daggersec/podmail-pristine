Hi Jen:

Attached find Joel Seligman's resume. As the academic literature listed =
in it points out, he's truly a leading thinker when it comes to =
securities regulation, and a brief conversation I had with him yesterday =
reinforces my understanding that he's able and willing to help in any =
way the new administration sees fit.

Please let me know if you have any questions...


RDK
