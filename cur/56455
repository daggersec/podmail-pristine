I met with Pete Rouse on Friday when I was in Chicago.  He suggested I cont=
act you regarding the transition work you're doing for Obama.  I am forward=
ing to you the note I sent to Pete.  Please let me know how I can be of hel=
p.

And, thanks for all the support you've been giving Jen through the Edwards =
debacle.  They've really been leaning on here to get them through this.  I =
know she appreciates the friendship and counsel you've provided her during =
this difficult time.  Just wanted you to know that I appreciate it, too.

Thanks for taking the time to meet on Friday.  Glad to help out on the camp=
aign in whatever way I can and will continue to work with Heather when and =
where she needs.

I appreciate the opportunity to work on the transition and am attaching my =
bio and resume as you suggested.  I appreciate your passing this along to C=
hris and will contact John Podesta directly.

As I mentioned, I've been working on a transition piece for USDA for a book=
 that CAP will produce.  However, I probably can be most helpful in working=
 on the natural resources, energy and environment elements of the transitio=
n given my work with conservation agencies in USDA and DOI.  Having focusse=
d alot with the Clinton administration and since at Yale on western lands i=
ssues like fire, forests, and roadless area protection, I probably know mor=
e about the large landscape issues.
But, wherever I can help...

One final thought.

I mentioned to Heather that I thought a simple and direct way to deal with =
the energy issues raised by gas prices (and the critical editorial in the N=
Y Times yesterday) would be to propose to redirect the tax credits now goin=
g to big oil (aka Exxon-Mobil) and instead give them to GM, Ford, and Chrys=
ler to accelerate their efforts to develop fuel efficient cars.  The auto m=
anufacturers need the credits (given big financial losses) and Exxon doesn'=
t.  But rather than an abstract redirect of these funds to consumers or to =
"accelerate development of cellulosic ethanol", by specifically redirecting=
 the tax credits to the auto manufacturers, the benefits should be clear --=
 especially for the union employees and the states that would benefit like =
Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin.  Key electoral states, of course.

Thanks again.  I look forward to helping with the campaign and the transiti=
on.
