interesting poll from Brownstein:
http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/big-questions/americans-want-a-=
raise-20150316?ref=3Dt.co&mrefid=3Dwalkingheader

particularly interesting:

Assessments darken further on the job situation: 28 percent term it
excellent or good, 33 percent fair, and 35 percent poor. But the clouds
really roll in on the final two measures. Asked to assess the state of
wages and incomes, only 20 percent describe them as excellent or good, 39
percent fair, and 37 percent poor. Similarly, only 19 percent give those
excellent/good marks to "the cost of living for necessities like housing,
food and energy," while 40 percent describes them as fair and 39 percent
poor.

Disenchantment on jobs, wages, and living costs transcend almost all
boundaries. The share of minorities, college-educated, and noncollege
whites who describe the job situation as excellent or good converges
between 25 and 29 percent; those earning six figures are barely more
favorable than those earning less than $30,000. There is similarly
broad-based discontent over wages and living costs: Among respondents
earning at least $100,000 or more and college-educated whites, two groups
at the top of the economic pyramid, still only one in five rate the wage
and income situation as good or excellent. Only about one in four in both
groups describe the cost of living situation as excellent or good.

Follow-up interviews with poll respondents underscored a deep frustration
over the protracted difficulty in getting ahead. Bentley, the Kentucky
Republican, recently left her job as a nursing educator to stay at home
with her children, because, she says, the economics of working didn't add
up. "I have a master's degree in nursing and I only clear $400 a month to
bring home to my family," she says. "For me to commute, pay childcare=E2=80=
=94which
is horrendous=E2=80=94and then all of the expenses that go along with actua=
lly
leaving the home, I don't clear enough to make it worth it. I went to
college, I have student loans, and I have to try to pay for it, but it's
still not worth it."

Similarly, Donna Blight, an attorney in Williamstown, Vt., says she sees
few people around her gaining ground. "There haven't been increases in
income," she says. "My son-in-law works for a big company, he's been there
for 20-plus years, but there are not consistent raises. I have another
family member who has worked for somebody for eight years and never got a
raise. That's the way it is here."

While the disenchantment over wages and living standards was broadly based,
one group stood out in its especially stark level of discontent: white
women without a college education. Just 10 percent of those women, who are
often described as "waitress moms," described the situation in wages or the
cost of living as excellent or good. On each measure, just over one-third
described conditions as only fair and about half picked the most negative
option=E2=80=94poor. By contrast, no more than about 40 percent of either
college-educated whites or noncollege white men picked the most negative
option on either measure.

Donna, a part-time cafeteria worker who lives near Evansville, Ind., and
asked not to give her last name, vividly expressed their discontent. "Most
of the people I know only have part-time jobs. They don't make enough money
working to even cover their bills, so a lot of people get some kind of
assistance," she says. "Almost everything here is around minimum wage. Even
working 40 hours a week=E2=80=94that's not enough to support yourself, much=
 less a
family."

If the frustration over stagnant living standards represents a slow-motion
earthquake rattling support for all of America's institutions,
working-class white women like Donna may be at its epicenter.
