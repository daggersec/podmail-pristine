John,

Kirsten needs your help and we have only 39 hours left. State and national Republicans are working overtime to take back control in New York and Washington and they are focusing their energy on Kirsten.

Recently we have learned that they are recruiting high profile figures like Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki.  They are focusing on derailing President Obama's agenda with scare tactics, and they are taking attention off the issues that really matter to New Yorkers.

Kirsten needs your support and needs it now. Please go to www.kirstengillibrand.com/contribute to make an immediate contribution or call our campaign at (347) 688-7677.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) spent the summer launching underhanded attacks against Kirsten and they are only going to get worse.  Now, more than ever, Kirsten needs help from people like you who have backed her in the past. 

We are 39 hours away from a major filing deadline.  Rudy Giuliani and George Pataki are going to make their decisions based on how much money we raise.

You've stood with Kirsten before, and I thank you for that.  We're just $45,000 away from reaching our goal.  $125,000 of grassroots money will make Giuliani and Pataki think twice about taking on Kirsten.  Now is the time to give to Kirsten so that she can continue to introduce herself across the state and work on progressive issues like health care reform, economic recovery and energy independence. 

By going to www.kirstengillibrand.com/contribute and making a contribution you will help us build our campaign.  Showing our strength in numbers is the only way we can fight back.

Thanks.

Ross Offinger

P.S. - Kirsten is ready for the fight. Show her you are too and donate today.
