Subject: Congressional Investigations Seminar | Proposed Paper Topic

Dear Professor Podesta and Judge Leon,

I write to propose a paper topic for your seminar on congressional
investigations:

I propose writing a paper on the House of Representatives's Special
Committee on Un-American Activities Authorized to Investigate Nazi
Propaganda and Certain Other Propaganda Activities, which operated
during the mid-1930s.  In particular, I am interested in the
Committee=E2=80=99s efforts to identify fascist infiltration and propaganda=
 in
the United States.  The Committee=E2=80=99s work appears to be documented i=
n
an extensive series of GPO publications and has been the subject of
some secondary research.  The topic is also of interest to me.  Before
enrolling in law school, I earned a PhD in history.  My dissertation
focused on the history of Nazi Germany.  Drawing on scholarship
concerning German espionage and propaganda directed against the United
States during the 1930s, the paper could use this historical case
study to explore the challenges that congressional investigations face
in addressing domestic threats to national security.

Please let me know if further information would be helpful to you and
if this would be an acceptable topic for the paper.

As I mentioned earlier in the semester, my wife and I are expecting a
child in the next week.  My wife is scheduled to deliver next
Thursday.  For that reason, I am likely to miss class on Thursday,
February 19, and perhaps Monday, February 23.  I thank you again for
your understanding and for your flexibility.

Best regards,
Eric Steinhart
