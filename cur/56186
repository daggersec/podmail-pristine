*Main Topics:* McCain Speech in Louisiana, Democratic Nomination Battle

*Summary of Shift:* All eyes were on the Democrats this evening, with Barack
Obama amassing enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee. Hillary
Clinton did not bow out and there were rumors that her supporters are
pushing for her to become Obama's VP. McCain delivered a speech tonight in
which he stated the general election has begun, refuted that he would be a
third Bush term, and painted himself as an agent of change.

Highlights:
1)    McCain declares the "general election campaign has begun", refutes
that he is a third Bush term
2)    Buchanan says Obama has "drawn blood" from McCain by putting him on
the defensive to refute he's a third Bush term
3)    Governor Tim Pawlenty interviewed on Fox News and CNN
a.     On Fox News, refutes *McBush* by calling McCain a "populist", a
"maverick", and "counterintuitive"
b.     On CNN, dodges a question whether McCain differs from Bush on the War
in Iraq "going forward", calls the current strategy the "McCain strategy"
4)    CNN reporter paints McClellan's book as a problem for McCain, who
helped push a war with faulty pretenses
5)    McCain adviser Steve Schmidt says "this election is about change" and
McCain "has a record of reform and change"
6)    McCain vs. Obama
a.     Carl Cameron explores a general election map; says Obama's support of
Palestinian cause as State Senator might pose a problem at AIPAC tomorrow
b.     Dean Reynolds discusses Obama's plan to define McCain as a third Bush
term
7)    McCain praises Clinton, Cafferty speculates he's using Fiorina to
appeal to female voters
8)    Chris Matthews discusses McCain's aborted one-term presidency pledge



Clips:

Highlight #1
*McCain Declares the General Election Has Begun, Refutes That He is a Third
Bush Term* (FNC 06/03/08 8:30pm)
JOHN MCCAIN: "You will hear from my opponent's campaign in every speech,
every interview, every press release that I'm running for President Bush's
third term. You will hear every policy of the President described as the
Bush-McCain policy. Why does Senator Obama believe it's so important to
repeat that idea over and over again? Because he knows it's very difficult
to get Americans to believe something they know is false. So he tries to
drum it into your minds by constantly repeating it rather than debate
honestly the very different directions he and I would take the country. But
the American people didn't get to know me yesterday, as they are just
getting to know Senator Obama. They know I have a long record of bipartisan
problem solving. They've seen me put our country before any President =97
before any party =97 before any special interest =97 before my own interest.
They might think me an imperfect servant of our country, which I surely am.
But I am her servant first, last and always."


Highlight #2
*Buchanan Says Obama Has "Drawn Blood" From McCain By Putting Him on
Defensive as a Third Bush Term* (MSNBC 06/03/08 10:20pm)
PAT BUCHANAN: McCain is going to hit and hammer the idea, this is not Bush's
third term, I've disagreed with him, I've disagreed with Rumsfeld. What does
this tell me? Barack Obama has drawn blood. This is very defensive.
Obviously they've polled this thing, and this Bush third term is hurting
him. And so he's got to go at that, but he sounds very defensive in the way
he's [indistinguishable].


Highlight #3
*Pawlenty Refutes McBush By Calling McCain a "Populist", "Maverick", and
"Counterintuitive" in Fox News Interview* (FNC 06/03/08 5:30pm)
JOHN GIBSON: What's America gonna learn about John McCain in the speech
tonight?

TIM PAWLENTY: Well I think Senator McCain is gonna outline his vision for
America that's gonna be win the war, keep a lid on spending, make sure that
we have a country that's moving forward with consumers in charge of health
care, that's gonna stand in contrast to the inexperience and kinda classic
liberal view of Senator Obama.

GIBSON: Why would he choose New Orleans? Specifically Kenner, Lousiana,
close enough, why there?

PAWLENTY: Well that may be viewed by some as a non-traditional place for a
Republican to be, but John McCain isn't your typical Republican. He's
certainly has been a Republican stalwart but he has a flair for being a bit
of a populist, a bit of a maverick, somebody who's a little
counterintuitive, in a lot of respects, and that's why people like him so
much. It's one of the many reasons people like him so much.

GIBSON: Governor, read between the lines. Because Obama's hitting him
everyday, that he's too tightly closed, or tightly connected rather with
George Bush. Is this is way of physically saying I am my own man. Steve
Schmidt, one of his leading campaign advisers said earlier today, "the
reality is Senator McCain has disagreed on issue after issue after issue
with President Bush."

PAWLENTY: Well anybody who is a fair or serious student of Senator McCain's
record would know that he has not been lockstep with President Bush and has
been a populist, an independent minded leader for our country for a number
of things. So that's gonna come out over the course of this campaign [...]
They're gonna see Senator McCain is in the mainstream and Senator Obama is
not.

*On CNN, Pawlenty Dodges A Question Whether McCain Differs From Bush on the
War in Iraq Going Forward, Calls The Current Strategy the "McCain
Strategy"*(CNN 06/03/08 6:20pm)
WOLF BLITZER: The democrats will make the point that McCain represents a
third Bush term. Bush is not very popular in Minnesota right now [...] Where
does Senator McCain differ right now going forward from President Bush on
the war in Iraq?

TIM PAWLENTY: Well I think, as you know, he was an early person

BLITZER: That was then, but what about going forward?

PAWLENTY: Well going forward, the strategy we have going forward is really
the McCain strategy. And so he was one of the people who envisioned this
strategy call for it to be done sooner and earlier even when President Bush
and Donald Rumsfeld and others were hesitant to do it at that time. This, I
think, is going to be a reflection of his wisdom and experience. There is a
reason why he knew this would be a workable strategy because he had
experience in military national security matters and that is going to serve
him well in this debate.


Highlight #4
*CNN Reporter Paints McClellan's Book as a Problem for McCain, Who Supported
a War With Faulty Pretenses* (CNN 06/03/08 6:00pm)
JOE JOHNS: [...] It builds with Iraq where he wants Americans to give war a
chance.

JOHN MCCAIN: America's progress in Iraq is the direct result of the new
strategy that Senator Obama vehemently opposed.

JOHNS: But his argument is hardly a slam-dunk. With new allegations
questioning the Bush Administration's drive to war, like those in former
White House spokesman Scott McClellan's new book, McCain is having to
convince voters that while he alone can end the war with honor, he might not
have started it in the first place.

JOHN MCCAIN: My first priority is the security of this nation, which is as
it should be but my second priority, but my second priority is to make sure
that we never send our young Americans into harms way unless the mission is
clear and the cause is justified.


Highlight #5
*McCain Adviser Steve Schmidt Says "This Election is About Change" And
McCain "Has a Record of Reform and Change"* (FNC 06/03/08 8:00pm)
JAMES ROSEN: [...] How can Senator McCain get Americans to believe that he
has something new to say about Barack Obama, haven't they heard everything
flying back and forth between all the candidates for months now?

STEVE SCHMIDT: Well, I think that presidential races have their ebbs and
flows. This is a moment where the American people are paying very close
attention. The general election begins tonight. Senator McCain is going to
acknowledge that Barack Obama, the Senator from Illinois, will be his
opponent for the presidency of the United States in November. This election
is about change. Senator McCain has a record of reform and change, of
fighting to change the broken systems in Washington. And he's gonna talk
that tonight [...]


Highlight #6
*Carl Cameron Explores the General Election Map, Says Obama's Support of
Palestinian Cause as State Senator Might Pose a Problem* (FNC 06/03/08
6:20pm)
CARL CAMERON: Barack Obama begins the full time battle with John McCain
exactly 22 weeks to the day before the general election. It's a virtual tie.
With Obama leading by less than %1.5 over McCain in the Real Clear Politics
Average of the latest national polls. But the presidency is decided state by
state in the electoral college and both sides expect a close race to the
very end. Obama begins with a slight edge. He leads the polls by an average
of at least 4% in these states for 242 of the 270 electors needed for
victory. Obama's strong on the west coast and the liberal northeast. He
leads in three states President Bush carried in '04, the swing states of
Iowa, New Mexico, and Colorado, a red state McCain can ill afford to lose
[...] Republicans know that the national political environment is very tough
for the GOP because of the war and the president's record unpopularity.
McCain, a 71 year old cancer survivor, will also have to deal with concerns
about his health and his age [...]

BRIT HUME: Carl, you were at the AIPAC summit with McCain this week. Now
we're on the eve of Obama's appearance before that same pro-Israel group. I
gather Republicans are making noise about some video out on the web. What is
that all about?

CAMERON: Yep, there was an interview done with a Chicago pro-Palestinian
activist back in January of this year. He talked about Barack Obama and it's
the kind of thing that could give pause to some participants of AIPAC
tomorrow. Here's a look.

[Show DemocracyNow Interview]

ALI ABUNIMAH: I knew Barack Obama for many years as my state Senator, when
he used to attend events in the Palestinian community in Chicago all the
time. I remember personally introducing him on stage in 1999 when we had a
major community fundraiser [...] And that's just one example of how Barack
Obama used to be very comfortable speaking up for and being associated with
Palestinian rights and opposing the Israeli Occupation.

*Reynolds Discusses Obama's Plan to Define McCain* (CBS 06/03/08 06:32pm)
DEAN REYNOLDS: And with an eye towards those Republicans who may be
disillusioned with the Bush administration, Obama will offer himself as an
alternative. Arguing that John McCain insures nothing so much as a third
term for Bush, more failures at home and abroad; a candidate with no plan to
bring the troops home from Iraq, and a hands-off economic policy without
relief for hard pressed Americans.


Highlight #7
*McCain Praises Clinton, Using Fiorina to Appeal to Female Voters* (CNN
06/03/08 5:00pm)
JACK CAFFERTY: Guess who Hillary Clinton's new best friend is? That would be
the presumptive Republican nominee John McCain. Singing Hillary's praises to
the heavens, McCain to a group of Tennessee voters, "I admire and respect
her. Hillary Clinton's inspired generations of American women to believe
they can reach to highest office in this nation. I admire the campaign she's
run. She's deserving of a great deal of credit." Interesting timing. Now
that Clinton's campaign is on it's last legs, Clinton has insisted that if
she's not the nominee she's gonna work with Barack Obama to unite the party
and beat the Republicans in November. But remember all of those Clinton
supporters who angrily said they'll vote for John McCain in the Fall if
Hillary's not the nominee. Apparently John McCain remembers. And it sounds
like he's wants to know if they're serious. There's another sign too that
McCain might be reaching out to Clinton's female supporters. One of his top
advisers, former Hewlert Packard CEO Carly Fiorina says she thinks Clinton
faced sexism on the campaign trail. Fiorina says she has a lot of sympathy
for what Clinton has been through and that "a lot of women recognize she's
been treated differently, whether they're Democrats or Republicans."


Highlight #8
*Matthews Discusses McCain's Initial One Term Limit Plan* (MSNBC 06/03/08
05:32pm)
CHRIS MATTHEWS: The Atlantic has a great scoop this week, he reported that
when John McCain announced his Presidential candidacy last year, he was just
inches away from pledging to serve just one term in the White House. Not
only that, but the one term presidency was going to be a central thrust of
the McCain campaign. Apparently John McCain changed his mind at the last
minute. It would have been, by the way, a wild departure from most
presidents who rely on fear, most presidential candidates rely on fear that
they'll be able to wield power for at least eight years.
