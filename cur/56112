It feels antiseptic. There's nothing wrong but it feels more like list than=
 a mission.

We need languages that demonstrates her belief that reviving manufacturing,=
 especially high tech small business manufacturing is essential if we are g=
oing to build on our progress to create lasting prosperity.
Manufacturing is about exports and seeking more American goods around the w=
orld.

Hey everyone --

These remarks look very similar to what she has today in New Hampshire.  Th=
e only significant difference is that now, in addition to manufacturing, we=
've added inversions and earnings stripping.

I'm sending this to the book now, so please send edits anytime overnight.

Thanks!
