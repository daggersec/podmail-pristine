Dear Ms. Clinton,=20

Greetings from your land of origin.  My wife and I are "all in" for you.

I truly hope that your campaign gives a real meaning to our =
redistribution challenge.
Not every American can "get and stay ahead," as I'm sure you know.
Opportunity is badly skewed; just look at the jobs picture in =
Chicagoland.

Why was there a "middle class" after WWII for 30-40 years?
Not because Americans were so smart and innovative.  No.
The USA had no competition; we had bombed the world flat.
And . . labor found it's voice during and after the Depression.

What is a realistic and meaningful role for the USA in the 21st C world =
economy?
Can decent-wage middle income jobs be created in our nation in this =
context?
And isn't there major (huge?) opportunity for jobs in the "new" energy =
sector at home?

The other lesson from 80 years ago was FDR's courage.
He was a "traitor to his class" when it came to banking reforms.
And you know how that was un-done in the late 1990s.
We still need WS (and private equity, etc.) to be slapped down by a fat =
margin.

So, Ms. Clinton . . bottom line.
Use your very powerful mind and excellent staff to outline an honest, =
smart, encouraging future.
Please.=20
Then Americans will follow . . and on something more substantial than =
"hope."
