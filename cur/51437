John -- =20

President Obama just released a new health reform proposal -- and our =
political director sent me an overview that I wanted to share with you.

Here's the bottom line: It's a plan that puts Americans in charge of their =
own health care, bridges the gap between the Senate and House bills, and =
adds additional ideas from both parties to fight waste and abuse.

The plan will serve as a starting point for discussion at a major =
bipartisan meeting this Thursday between the President and congressional =
leaders to discuss Republican and Democratic ideas for improving our =
health care system. And if there are more areas of agreement, they'll be =
added to the plan.

Ultimately, we're going to move forward with a bill that lowers costs, =
increases competition, provides relief for families and small businesses, =
and covers the uninsured -- and we'll need your help to do it.

Please take a look below at the details of the proposal so that you'll =
have all the info you'll need for the fight ahead. And if you want to find =
out more about how the proposal would affect you, click here:

Mitch --

FYI, here's a quick overview from the White House of the President's =
just-released proposal on health reform. Exciting stuff.

It builds on legislation passed by the House and Senate, bridging the =
differences in those bills while adding new provisions.

The most notable addition is the creation of a new "Health Insurance Rate =
Authority," which would give the federal government the power to review =
unreasonable rate increases and other unfair practices by the big =
insurance companies.

The policy experts I speak to think this is a really strong improvement -- =
and would help a lot of people in places where insurers are jacking up =
rates like they are in California, Maine, and around the country.

-- Addisu

     Overview of the President's Proposal

The President's Proposal puts American families and small business owners =
in control of their own health care.

-- It makes insurance more affordable by providing the largest middle =
class tax cut for health care in history, reducing premium costs for tens =
of millions of families and small business owners who are priced out of =
coverage today. This helps over 31 million Americans afford health care =
who do not get it today -- and makes coverage more affordable for many =
more.

-- It sets up a new competitive health insurance market giving tens of =
millions of Americans the exact same insurance choices that members of =
Congress will have.

-- It brings greater accountability to health care by laying out =
commonsense rules of the road to keep premiums down and prevent insurance =
industry abuses and denial of care.

-- It will end discrimination against Americans with pre-existing =
conditions.

-- It puts our budget and economy on a more stable path by reducing the =
deficit by $100 billion over the next ten years -- and about $1 trillion =
over the second decade -- by cutting government overspending and reining =
in waste, fraud and abuse.

It includes a targeted set of changes to the Patient Protection and =
Affordable Care Act, the Senate-passed health insurance reform bill. Key =
changes include:

-- Eliminating the Nebraska Medicaid provision and providing significant =
additional federal financing to all states for the expansion of Medicaid;

-- Closing the Medicare prescription drug "donut hole" coverage gap;

-- Strengthening the Senate bill's provisions that make insurance =
affordable for individuals and families;

-- Strengthening the provisions to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in =
Medicare and Medicaid;

-- Increasing the threshold for the excise tax on the most expensive =
health plans from $23,000 for a family plan to $27,500 and starting it in =
2018 for all plans;

-- Improving insurance protections for consumers and creating a new Health =
Insurance Rate Authority to provide federal assistance and oversight to =
states in conducting reviews of unreasonable rate increases and other =
unfair practices of insurance plans.
