GQR Team,

Can we get some more analysis on the special interest and corruption
questions? Who is moving on them? Dem-Indy-GOP differences. Age, gender
differences. Regressions etc... How does this compare to other questions?

There is the WRONG TRACK question at the beginning of the poll and then some
of the questions in the doubts batteries.

Thanks,

-Tom
