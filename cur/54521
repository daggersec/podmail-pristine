Hillary



I wanted to send you a note with some thoughts.



I believe you are going to win the Democratic nomination, even if you lose
Iowa and New Hampshire.  But how you react to those losses, if they occur,
will very much shape the outcome of the race.



I was in New Hampshire a few weeks ago campaigning and the single hardest
issue people raised to me was the notion that you are going to win the
Democratic nomination, so there=E2=80=99s no problem sending a message to t=
he
system in voting for Sanders.  In tonight=E2=80=99s NYT CBS poll, most Demo=
crats
still think you are going to be the nominee.  So voting for Sanders is a
=E2=80=98free=E2=80=99 vote to register their anger at the establishment.  =
That of course
will change if he wins Iowa.  Faced with him as a real potential to be the
nominee, I believe people will be scared; particularly with Trump or Cruz
as the alternative.



They will then look at you anew.  You will optimize that moment if you
respond to that loss well, with grit and grace.



In every race you=E2=80=99ve run, people need to see in - one form or anoth=
er -
that you actually bleed.  It is when you get knocked down or take the punch
that they get their measure of you and come to your side.  You never win
ahead.  In 2000, we were running basically even until Lazio harassed you to
sign his pledge; and Democrats moved decisively in your favor. It also
happened in that moment on election eve in  200: that was about you telling
people that you are running for them in deeply personal terms =E2=80=93 you=
 take
these licks because you want to make their lives better.



It was also when we started winning for good in 08: in Ohio in your victory
speech where you said you get knocked down but you get back up and your
victory was for all those Americans who do the same. And even in this race,
when Democrats saw you with poise, calm and grace bear the 11 hour Benghazi
committee kangaroo court  they moved decisively for you.  In each of these
cases you are taking some real licks.



And that is why I think this moment is so important.  You can make this
race about them.  Or you can make it about you and Bernie.



I worry that the current hard contrasts with Sanders is driving a notion
that you are the establishment candidate; because that is what
establishment candidates do =E2=80=93 they attack.  In this way, the contra=
st feeds
the narrative of their campaign.  Just as it did 8 years ago with Obama.



However, if instead of responding to the changing race with attacks you
take an alternative step:  you strip down your core message to an economic
one where you are hearing the struggles of folks in Iowa and NH and you are
going to fight like hell to make their economic lives better.  And if you
do lose Iowa, then you have an opportunity to say you've been knocked down,
but you are getting up to fight for this nomination. Because you hear them
(as you said in New Hampshire 8 years ago).  You hear them and you will
fight for them.



We have done lots of work on trust in government.  The level of anger
amongst everyone is high. The key takeaway is people are so disappointed in
Washington that it is radicalizing them.  How you act is more important
than what you promise because there have been so many promises broken.  And
they can see how you act. That is why the manner in which the campaign is
conducted is so important.





I hope this is helpful.
