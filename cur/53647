The Air Force just called to offer me a job as the Special Victims Counsel
at Travis AFB (an hour or so away from Dublin on the road to Truckee).
Would move there in January.

Am I crazy to take it?  I'm still having fun in the USAF and I think I
would enjoy the job.  And on a personal level, getting back to Northern
California would be great.  My sole concern is that if I stay with the
military too long it might prove difficult to break away later.  Much of a
difference between four and six years?  General thoughts/guidance?
