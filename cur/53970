Hi John

Hope you are having  a good weekend.  Here are a few things I want to ask
you about when we talk this afternoon:

Todd mentioned that negotiations for this deal began in earnest in
February, when he traveled to Beijing with Sec. Kerry.  It is not clear to
me if the President was aware of the initiative at this time, or if it was
instigated by Todd and Sec. Kerry.  Can you help clarify?

I=E2=80=99d like to learn few more details about the two letters the Presid=
ent
Obama sent to President Xi

At the UN summit, the President met with Zhang Gaoli, where he told the
Obama that President Xi had =E2=80=9Cdecided to do it=E2=80=9D  [the deal] =
 But you still
had not seen China=E2=80=99s numbers, correct?   Can you characterize this
conversation?

When did you first learn of the actual numbers the Chinese were willing to
put on the table?  And was the carbon cap in 2030 and the 20% renewable
both tabled at the same time, or was the renewable goal added later?

What were the last hurdles to closing this deal, and how they were resolved=
?


Best

Jeff
