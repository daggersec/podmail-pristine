Great stuff Nikki, and thanks for all your work on this.

When do we think we will get AFT's proposal?  We should lock in soon

Flagging for everyone the AFLCIO prep and the Trade/Malaysia/State stuff
below. Definitely should be on our radar.

Good evening
Great event last night at John's home!  I've gotten really good feedback
today from the event.  I've touched base with AFSCME, IAM, NEA, Building
Trades, ATU, CWA, IBEW and UA.
CWA continues to mention her answer on trade as "hedging" (no real news
here).  ATU requested more policy feedback so I will connect with Maya.
Otherwise, great feedback.  AFSCME said, "She hit every right note".

I will work on thank you notes to everyone tomorrow.  I am going to hold on
President to President follow up with AFSCME, AFT, IAM until post 7/30 EC
meeting.  I think the tension within the AFL-CIO over AFT's early
endorsement would not send a good message.  Please let me know if you
disagree.

Other items:
-IAM is hearing that Biden is reaching out to 08 Obama staff.  Not much
other detail but they thought worth flagging.
-AFT is going to be requesting a August Back to School event with HRC.  I
believe they need to connect HRC personally with some members.  That will
be helpful both ways.
-Senator Mikulski COS follow up-I will be working on list of labor women
for outreach.
-IAFF-I tried moving them up to September but it is likely October will be
the endorsement month.  They are still 100% on track though.

Preparation for the AFL-CIO EC Meeting:  July 30th

   - I would recommend significant prep time for HRC headed into the
   meeting.  I think its important that she feel comfortable going into the
   room.
   - Heads Up:  Larry Cohen will possibly still be seated at the Executive
   Council.  EC terms do not immediately expire with a Union Presidency
   terms.  Something to note.
   - Two issues:


   1. Trade:  Please see the article below.  I think we should be prepared
   that several EC members will want to press the Secretary to be specific =
on
   trade.  The new twist on TPP with the WH/State Department adjusting
   Malaysia's human trafficking standard to clear a path for inclusion of
   Malaysia in TPP, will most definitely come up.  From a political
   perspective, is this a opportunity for HRC to provide a specific example=
 of
   something that would be a no-go for her with trade?  Politically that wo=
uld
   be helpful in this room.  I think there will be significant pressure for
   the Secretary to state a position on this given her experience at the St=
ate
   Dept.
   2. Cadillac Tax Repeal:  This issue will definitely come up.  Again,
   from just a labor/political perspective it would be very helpful for her=
 to
   support a repeal with many unions we are targeting for endorsement
   (Laborers, UAW, USW, NEA, IBT, etc).  It uniquely crosses private and
   public sector. Its also opposed by business including the Chamber, NAM a=
nd
   many large employers.  I have lots of materials on this circulate if
   helpful.  Congressman Joe Courtney has a bill in the House (with 115

*Obama To Upgrade Malaysia On Human Rights Despite Mass Graves*



The Huffington Post

By Zach Carter

July 8, 2015 at 10:59pm



WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration will remove Malaysia from its
official list of the world's worst human trafficking offenders, according
to Reuters
<http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKCN0PJ00F20150709?pageNumber=3D1=
&virtualBrandChannel=3D0>,
a move human rights advocates fear will damage U.S. credibility.

The maneuver would allow the administration to continue negotiating a
controversial trade agreement with Malaysia and 10 other Pacific nations.
Legislation authored by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) effectively bars the
U.S. from enacting trade deals with countries deemed "Tier 3" violators of
human trafficking standards -- the worst of the worst in the State
Department's formal reckoning of governments that facilitate modern-day
slavery.

Malaysia earned its spot on that list, alongside Iran and North Korea,
<http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226844.pdf> from years of
human trafficking, including rampant sex slavery
<http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/226847.pdf> and forced labor
in the agriculture and the textile industries, according to 2014 State
Department documents. Malaysia's electronics industry also is rife with for=
ced
labor
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/02/obama-trade-malaysia_n_7495750.ht=
ml>.
This year, mass graves
<http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/25/malaysia-migrant-mass-graves-=
police-reveal-139-sites-some-with-multiple-corpsesl>
for
trafficking victims were discovered in Malaysia near its northern border
with Thailand.

Reuters reports that Malaysia will soon be upgraded to a "Tier 2" country,
allowing it to sidestep the ban imposed by the Menendez legislation. The
State Department said it does not comment on its human trafficking list
before it is formally issued. In a statement to HuffPost, Menendez said the
maneuver would undermine the international legitimacy of America's human
rights efforts.

"If true, this manipulation of Malaysia=E2=80=99s ranking in the State Depa=
rtment=E2=80=99s
2015 TIP report would be a perversion of the trafficking list and undermine
both the integrity of this important report as well as the very difficult
task of confronting states about human trafficking," Menendez said in the
statement. "The deplorable human trafficking crisis in Malaysia merits a
global cry for action and justice -- not an attempt to sweep them under the
rug for political expediency."

Malaysia passed a law
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/18/malaysia-human-trafficking_n_7616=
702.html>
in
June amid international controversy over its human trafficking record that
would provide additional protections for victims. Human trafficking has
long been illegal in Malaysia, however. The country's critics -- including
the State Department -- have not focused on its legal standards, but on its
willingness to enforce those standards.

Human Rights Watch has persistently
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/19/human-trafficking-tpp_n_7323044.h=
tml>
criticized
Obama administration efforts to undermine the Menendez language.

Malaysia partially controls the Strait of Malacca
<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/30/malaysia-slavery-trade_n_7472682.=
html>,
a key shipping lane for Middle Eastern oil bound for China. The Obama
administration has repeatedly argued that its Trans-Pacific Partnership
trade pact is designed to contain China's growing economic clout.
