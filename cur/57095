	   Vice Presidential candidate Sen. John Edwards was caught
visiting his mistress and secret love child at 2:40 this morning in a
Los Angeles hotel
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_a
nd_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>  by the NATIONAL ENQUIRER.
=09
	The married ex-senator from North Carolina
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_a
nd_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>  - whose wife Elizabeth
continues to battle cancer -- met with his mistress, blonde divorcee
Rielle Hunter, at the Beverly Hilton
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_a
nd_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>  on Monday night July 21 -
and the NATIONAL ENQUIRER was there! He didn't leave until early the
next morning.
=09
	Rielle had driven to Los Angeles
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_a
nd_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>  from Santa Barbara with a
male friend for the rendezvous with Edwards. The former senator attended
a press event Monday afternoon with L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on
the topic of how to combat homelessness.
=09
	But a months-long NATIONAL ENQUIRER investigation had yielded
information that Rielle and Edwards, 54, had arranged to secretly meet
afterward and for the ex-senator to spend some time with both his
mistress and the love child who he refuses to publicly acknowledge as
his own.
=09
	The NATIONAL ENQUIRER broke the story of Edwards' love child
scandal last year, when Rielle was still pregnant and Edwards was still
considered a strong candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
	Both parties denied the NATIONAL ENQUIRER report and a close
friend of Edwards' came forward and said he was the father of Rielle's
baby. But sources told the NATIONAL ENQUIRER a far different story -
they revealed that Edwards was engineering a massive cover up of his
shocking infidelity.
=09
	Sources came forward after that story appeared and told The
NATIONAL ENQUIRER that Edwards and Rielle had met secretly several
times, so that he could see his baby and continue his relationship with
Rielle.
	The NATIONAL ENQUIRER learned that one such meeting was set for
yesterday and observed the secret meeting.
	At 9:45 p.m. (PST) Monday Edwards appeared at the hotel
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_a
nd_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193> , and was dropped off at a
side entrance. NATIONAL ENQUIRER reporter Alan Butterfield witnessed the
ex-senator get out of a BMW driven by a male companion and stroll into
the hotel.
	Said Butterfield: "Edwards was not carrying anything. He walked
in alone. He was wearing a blue dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up.
He was looking around nervously before he entered the hotel.
=09
	"Once inside, he interestingly bypassed the lobby and ducked
down a side stairs to go to the bottom floor to catch the elevator up -
rather than taking the elevator in the main lobby. He went out of his
way not to be seen."
	Meanwhile, Reille had reserved rooms 246 and 252 under the name
of the friend who had accompanied her from Santa Barbara, Bob McGovern.
Reille was in one room and McGovern was in another with her baby. This
allowed her and Edwards to spend time alone, a source revealed.
=09
	Edwards went out of the hotel briefly with Reille, was observed
by the NATIONAL ENQUIRER and then went back to her room, where he stayed
until attempting to sneak out of the hotel unseen at 2:40 a.m. (PST).
But when he emerged alone from an elevator into the hotel basement he
was greeted by several reporters from the NATIONAL ENQUIRER.
=09
	Senior NATIONAL ENQUIRER Reporter Alexander Hitchen asked
Edwards why he was visiting Rielle and whether he was ready to confirm
that he was the father of her baby.
	Shocked to see a reporter, and without saying anything, Edwards
ran up the stairs leading from the hotel basement to the lobby. But,
spotting a photographer, he doubled back into the basement. As he
emerged from the stairwell, reporter Butterfield asked questioned him
about his hookup with Reille.
=09
	Edwards did not answer and then ran into a nearby restroom. He
stayed inside for about 15 minutes, refusing to answer questions from
the NATIONAL ENQUIRER about what he was doing in the hotel. A group of
hotel security
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_a
nd_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>  men eventually escorted him
from the men's room, while preventing the NATIONAL ENQUIRER reporters
from following him out of the hotel.
=09
	Said reporter Hitchen: "After we confronted him about seeing
Rielle, Edwards looked like a deer caught in headlights!
=09
	"He was clearly surprised that we had caught him at this very
late hour inside the hotel.
=09
	\ "Some guests up at this late hour watched the spectacle in
amusement from a staircase nearby."
=09
	Meanwhile, Rielle's friend McGovern also refused to answer any
questions from the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or offer any explanation for her
meeting with Edwards.
	The Edwards "love child" scandal drew international press
attention after the NATIONAL ENQUIRER published a blockbuster
investigation about the politician in our Dec. 31, 2007 print edition.
	We reported that Rielle, a woman linked to Edwards in a cheating
scandal earlier last year, was more than six months pregnant - and we
reported that she told a close confidante that Edwards was the father of
her baby!
	Edwards denied the affair and that he was the father, and in a
bizarre twist, a close friend of his, Alexander Young, said he was the
father. Young, 41, was married at the time with three children. The
NATIONAL ENQUIRER has learned he still is married.
	Sources told the NATIONAL ENQUIRER exclusively that Edwards had
engineered a massive cover up of the affair and love child scandal and
that Young was taking the blame for his good friend. At the time Rielle
had been relocated from the New York
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen_john_edwards_caught_with_mistress_a
nd_love_child_in_la_hotel/celebrity/65193>  area to Chapel Hill in
Edwards' home state of North Carolina, where she was living in an
upscale gated community down the street from Young. Strangely, Young
even had Rielle to his house for dinner with his wife and kids, the
NATIONAL ENQUIRER has learned.
=09
	Young has been extremely close to Edwards for years and was a
key official in his presidential campaign.
=09
	Rielle is a self-described filmmaker whose company was hired by
a pro-Edwards group called One America Committee. She was paid $114,000
to produce videos for Edwards' campaign and worked with him on those
videos.
	Reporters from other media outlets asked Edwards about The
NATIONAL ENQUIRER report during a campaign stop in Columbia, S.C.
	Edwards responded: "The story is false. It's completely untrue,
ridiculous," adding: "Anyone who knows me knows that I have been in love
with the same woman for 30-plus years."
	Rielle issued her own statement, saying in part: "The innuendos
and lies that have appeared on the Internet and in the NATIONAL ENQUIRER
concerning John Edwards are not true, completely unfounded and
ridiculous."
	But a source told the NATIONAL ENQUIRER: "Now that it seems to
have blown wide open, Rielle may get her wish - all she wants is for
John to marry her and for them to live happily ever after with their
baby. She's tired of running and living a lie."
=09
	A representative for Reille had no comment on last night's
meeting with Edwards.=20
