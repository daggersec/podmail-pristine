> New York Times Omits Key Facts To Fabricate Dishonest Clinton-Obama Fundra=
ising Scandal
> The New York Times omitted key facts it had previously reported to dishone=
stly accuse Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration of selling politica=
l favors to an Ecuadorean family in exchange for campaign donations. Excised=
 from the Times reporting is the fact that prominent Republicans, including S=
en. Marco Rubio, have the exact same relationship with the donors that the T=
imes is now portraying as a problem for Democrats. =20
>=20
> "Ecuador family wins favors after donations to Democrats," the Times headl=
ine claimed. The article detailed the decision to grant a travel visa to a "=
politically connected Ecuadorean woman," and argued that the decision to do s=
o was connected to "tens of thousands of dollars" the family of the woman, E=
stefania Isaias, has given to Democratic campaigns.
>=20
> According to the Times, "the case involving Estefania could prove awkward f=
or Mrs. Clinton," based on the fact that she was Secretary of State when mem=
bers of Congress were advocating for travel visa for the relative of two Flo=
rida residents seen as fugitives by the Ecuadorean government.=20
>=20
> The Times fixated on political donations given by the Isaias family to Dem=
ocrats as if it were news, but the Times already reported on the money the I=
saias family has given to elected officials in a March 11, 2014, article. Mo=
reover, that prior article noted that potential Republican presidential cand=
idate Sen. Marco Rubio and Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen had also aide=
d the Isaias' at the same time their political campaigns received donations l=
inked to that family -- facts absent from the more recent piece.
>=20
> In March, the Times made clear that the family gave significant campaign c=
ontributions to Florida Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Ile=
ana Ros-Lehtinen, who "acknowledged trying to help the family with immigrati=
on troubles." The Republicans sent letters -- in one case directly to Clinto=
n herself -- inquiring into the immigration issues surrounding members of th=
e family or advocating on their behalf.
>=20
> "The family gave about $40,000 to Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, whose district members=
 live in," the Times reported then. "Last month, she acknowledged to The Dai=
ly Beast that while she was chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committe=
e she sent four letters to top American officials, including Hillary Rodham C=
linton, then secretary of state, advocating on behalf of three members of th=
e Isaias family who had problems with their residencies. She called it 'stan=
dard practice' for constituents."
>=20
> That detail has is absent from this week's Times article.=20
>=20
> Here's the Times in March: "Mr. Rubio, whose political action committee re=
ceived $2,000 from Luis Isaias, also made 'routine constituent inquiries' in=
to immigration matters for two family members, his office said." In December=
, Rubio's advocacy vanished from the Times.
>=20
> Additionally, while the article suggests in its opening paragraph that Est=
efania Isaias was given permission to enter the country in 2012 in direct re=
sponse to the donations from her family, she reportedly received the same ac=
cess on six prior occasions dating back to the first restrictions on her mov=
ement in 2007 under the Bush Administration. Indeed, the Times reported in t=
he 23rd paragraph of its article that a spokesperson for Sen. Robert Menende=
z (D-NJ) said the senator's office had gotten involved with the Isaias case b=
ecause "because Ms. Isa=C3=ADas had previously been allowed to travel to the=
 United States six times despite the ban, and the decision to suddenly enfor=
ce it seemed arbitrary and wrong."
>=20
> Conservative media are exploiting the Times' shoddy reporting -- reporting=
 that doesn't stand up to basic scrutiny in light of what the Times itself h=
as previously reported.=20
>=20
> "Clinton State Dept Pulled Strings for Menendez in Pay-to-Play Deal with D=
em Donor," the Washington Free Beacon headline claimed. "Controversial Ecuad=
orian Family Donated About $100,000 to Obama ... and the State Department Re=
turned the Favor," is the take over at The Blaze. The Daily Caller: "Sen Men=
endez Pushed Hillary Clinton To Grant Visa For Daughter Of Ecuadoran Bank Fu=
gitive."
>=20
> Taking The New York Times' lead, Rubio's and Ros-Lehtinen's advocacy on be=
half of their donors is nowhere to be seen.
