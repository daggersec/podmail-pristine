Mike & Co. --

The pattern is familiar from last month's CR and almost every must-pass piec=
e of legislation considered by Congress the past five years -- there is majo=
rity support for a solution but it cannot come to a vote until the House has=
 considered an alternative proposed by the Freedom Caucus that cannot pass i=
n the Senate and would be vetoed in any event. =20

There is a Caucus-supported (hopelessly outlandish) alternative regarding th=
e debt limit on the table but, distracted and disorganized more than usual d=
uring this Boehner-Ryan interregnum, House leadership hasn't settled on a wa=
y forward on consideration  with time running out.=20

That's the bottom line right now on the debt limit.  Details below. =20

Best,

Dana=20

----------

House GOP leadership is still searching for a plan for raising the debt limi=
t now that a proposal pushed by conservatives does not appear to have enough=
 support and is unlikely to receive a vote this week.

This afternoon, Nancy Pelosi summarized the timing in the House on the bid t=
o increase the debt limit as follows:  "It=E2=80=99s only a matter of hours u=
ntil we have to act in the House. We have to act really by tomorrow. This ca=
lendar of chaos =E2=80=A6 is really coming down to hours, days, weeks."

The President has long insisted that Congress send him a clean debt limit bi=
ll. Such a bill could probably clear Congress. Senate Republicans had planne=
d to take up the House bill and amend it in a manner that could pass the Sen=
ate, potentially making it a clean debt-ceiling measure to attract Democrati=
c votes. But GOP leaders said they were planning contingency plans in case t=
he House stumbles, a number of Senators have said.

Generally, Senate Republicans are trying to counter the image created by the=
 disarray in the House by projecting a sense of calm and ability to govern. =
 Accordingly, here is Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn's take today on where=
 things stand:  "Shame on us if we haven't sort of thought about that in adv=
ance and war-gamed it.  It's possible we could pass something, and we send i=
t back to the House, and they pass it before it gets to the president. We're=
 getting ready to get on a glide path to get to a conclusion here."

The alternative on the table would lift the debt limit until 2017, attempt t=
o freeze all agency regulations for at least a year, try to force Congress t=
o stay in session until it passes all appropriations bills and forbid the Se=
nate from filibustering spending bills after October.

The consensus is that it is a non-starter itself but a first step before the=
 inevitable: a vote on a debt limit bill without strings.

But the next step is uncertain.  House GOP leadership is likely to abandon t=
entative plans to vote on the alternative, hatched by the Republican Study C=
ommittee, throwing into question how Congress is going to lift the borrowing=
 limit before a November 3 deadline.

House leadership was considering a vote on the proposal, tune Terms of Credi=
t Act, tomorrow, but GOP insiders said they will not put the bill on the flo=
or.  A House whip check last night showed the party several dozen votes shor=
t.   It's back to the drawing board now -- =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ll continue c=
onversations with our members on how best to address the debt ceiling,=E2=80=
=9D a Republican leadership aide said today.=20

House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made it clear this afternoon that there=
 is no emergency and that his colleagues are hard at work and being creative=
: =E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99ve got a lot of different ideas cooking.  We=E2=80=99l=
l have to wait and see.=E2=80=9D
