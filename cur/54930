I was going to call Diana F. and make the case for OMB Deputy again.
Obviously, we would need to discuss this with the OMB Director, but
would it be possible to think about her being the OMB Deputy in the
NEC/DPC processes for issues of greatest interest to her (e.g., health,
education)?  We wouldn't want to disenfranchise Rob, but splitting that
part of the Deputy's responsibilities and giving her a seat at the table
might make it more attractive for her.

I spoke to Blair this morning, and we're off and running there with the
vet.
