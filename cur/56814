John, 

Just stepped out of our morning campaign meeting and wanted to let you know where we stand for the quarter. We've raised $136,325 from 3,327 donors, so all we need is another $13,675 to beat our $150,000 goal by midnight Friday. 

I know Kirsten reached out to you earlier-thanks so much for chipping in. I wouldn't ask again, but we're so close to the goal, and we can't take any chances that the pundits and prognosticators are going to say Kirsten is weak because we missed this goal. 

*Click here to rush your contribution of $500 or whatever you can before midnight Friday. [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/11833/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate2012.sjs?donate_page_KEY=12417 ]* 

We count on Kirsten to fight back against the GOP's extremist agenda and to bring a progressive voice to the Senate. Hope we can count on your support again today to keep her there. 

Ross
