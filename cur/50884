Greetings! - I need to go "to press" on Monday to get this book printed in
time for Susan's birthday next week.  I know you're super busy, but it'd
mean a lot to Susan if you were able to share a few thoughts as she marks
this benchmark occasion.  You only turn 50 once!

Thanks so much,
Steve

Greetings Friends and Family!

Susan is fast approaching her benchmark birthday (50!!) on September 19th.
 To commemorate the occasion, I would love to compile a "book" of
testimonials from her friends and family about what they appreciate in her
and how she has touched their lives (in ways small or large).

To do that, I need your help.  And it should only take a couple minutes
(and doesn't require buying or making a gift (or dumping ice water on your
head)).  I have set up a Google Form where you can input your comments, and
then I will compile all the responses into an attractive "book" that
captures and conveys how much we all love, care about, and appreciate her.
 The form is accessible at this link
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fNsYnD_v-M0kkZWL_mEw2lwmkMSfHHgjw_VLP5iBWHo/viewform?usp=send_form>
:

If you could please fill it out this weekend, that will give me time to put
it all together and make it nice and pretty.

Thank you SO much.  I think Susan will really be touched by what everyone
has to share.  Again, please CLICK HERE
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1fNsYnD_v-M0kkZWL_mEw2lwmkMSfHHgjw_VLP5iBWHo/viewform?usp=send_form>
to share your words of tribute.

Best,
Steve

P.S.  It probably goes without saying, but let me say anyway that this is a
SURPRISE for Susan, so please don't say anything to her about it until the
19th.  Gracias.
