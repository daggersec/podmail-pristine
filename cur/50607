Anna is right about Social Security and S-CHIP.  Those are, I suspect,
easy fixes.
=20
...but The Hug is the point.  It needs to be the iconic image, burned
into people's consciousness.  It's Dukakis in the tank.  If we could get
it in three times I'd be for it.  The Hug not only links McCain to Bush,
it feminizes him.  He looks like a smaller, weaker dog exposing his neck
to the alpha male.  And it will drive McCain batshit.    I'm for all
hugs, all the time.

Agree with Paul and Andrew. =20

=20

On Happy Together, I think that the images need to be changed slightly.
You barely see the photo of Bush smiling from the podium, but you see
the hugging photo twice for a long time at the end.  It might be nice to
end the spot with one of McCain's quotes about how much he admires and
respects George Bush.  Finally, we should go to the McCain poll for the
evidence on linkage to Bush on the economy - the strongest economic hit
includes privatizing social security and opposition to schip, in
addition to tax breaks for millionaires. =20

I just have a couple of thoughts...

=20

I think "Fatigues" could be made to work with the priorities message if
the chyron and voiceover more explicitly linked the money spent in Iraq
to what it hasn't been spent on at home.  I also think we need to update
the $486 billion number.  I'm pretty sure we can get away with calling
it a trillion dollar war at this point, or at least "almost" or "nearly"
$1 trillion.

=20

I like the priorities spots with Rose, but I thought we had all agreed
with John that we should change "1000 years" to "100 years" to make the
message sound more credible.  Agree with Paul that it would make sense
to add "Iraq War Veteran."

=20

I liked "Happy Together" as well but I'd suggest playing with the text a
bit.  Perhaps something like:

*	"McCain supports keeping our troops in Iraq for decades... just
like Bush" instead of "opposing bringing our troops home... just like
Bush."  I think the proactive framing of him wanting to keep troops
there forever is a bit more powerful than simply opposing withdrawal.  =20
*	"They've spent $1 trillion on Iraq instead of health care,
qualities jobs and new energy sources" instead of "spent $486 billion on
Iraq instead of health care."  I think with the economy becoming more
and more the issue, it makes sense to include an explicit reference to
jobs.  And why not also include energy to round out the big three?=20
*	"Make Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations
permanent" instead of "Make the tax cuts for the wealthy permanent."  ?=20

=20

"Fatigues" does not get to the misplaced priorities/economic argument
about Iraq.  The only takeaway is endless war.

=20

"Happy Together" is, as you know, the spot I've fantasized about for two
years.  I love it.  It feminizes McCain and ridicules him.  Will
generate buzz and perhaps piss the old sailor off.  It certainly draws
the link between McCain and Bush.  I think it's sticky and memorable.

=20

Of the ads with Rose and her baby, "Priorities" and "Priorities alt" are
the only ones that get to the misplaced priorities message.  The others
suffer from the same problem as "Fatigues":  they're "endless war"
spots.  Fine for 2006, a half-step off for 2008.  But Rose is a star and
that baby is adorable.  I would add the phrase "Iraq War Veteran" under
her name and National Guard status, just to drive home the point that
she was shipped out to Iraq; she's not "just" a mom. =20

=20

Those are my two cents.

Subject: We've got some ads...

Here is the status. We've got some rough cuts of ads and some ads still
coming in. Overall I'm happy but not ecstatic about what we've got.
They're good ads. We just don't have a good mix yet. No straight economy
spots yet, for example. We are expecting "dating," "mcsame" and a
votevets-paid-for ad called "target" later today. Next push is for
economy spots. They might not be for this week.

Please review and send me feedback. I'm on my cell at 202-251-8545 if
you want to download feedback verbally.

Thanks, Tom



FIRST TUESDAY MEDIA ADS

Six ads are included--alternative versions of the same spot. We are
expecting "Dating" today and an ad that VoteVets paid for with their own
resources called "Target"

MARK ARMOUR ADS

Three ads are included. We remade "fatigues" mostly to have a webtest
benchmark. The second ad is something the ad maker threw together after
talking to Paul and I.
