Just spoke w/ Robert Rangel.  Said that PE wants to meet w/ SECDEF
sometime in the bloc of 330-500pm on Monday and that we would be back in
touch with more specifics concerning time and place.

He said assume that anywhere within that time works and he'll standby
for more as we get it. =20

The one area in which he was interested was ensuring discretion.  So,
location was key.=20

Best,
Mark
