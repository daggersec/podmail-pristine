Here is the real challenge:  truth vs. reality.

1. she has no paid consultants doing politics

2. she is as horrified as all of us that maggie H wrote this piece but
shutting down these articles is hard given they have decided to cover her.

3. news maker attribute to her what others are doing - so the PACS are
treated as her even though she can't and isn't involved with them.

so it would be great to brainstorm how that changes.

I am happy to convene such a gathering/call - though it will get reported
if someone talks as a political meeting rather than one designed to
preserve her options.

adding others (john p, pir, minyon, maggie, jim K) who can be reflective
about this.
