From our Friends @ American Values Network regarding supporting a
comprehensive climate, jobs and energy bill

   *National Security Threats Posed by Climate Change
*

Dear ,

I've spent my entire life working to keep America safe. That is why I feel
compelled to add my voice to the growing number of senior U.S. generals,
admirals, and veterans
<http://vbuttons.com/click.php?em_id=30156978&clickid=click1&clickurl=http://americanvaluesnetwork.org/climate/support/>calling
for immediate actions to address the alarming national security threats
posed by climate change and our dependence on foreign oil.

*We spend a billion dollars a day on foreign oil, over half of which comes
from countries that are hostile to us.*  Last year, we paid over $255
BILLION to Middle Eastern countries that are the primary funders for
terrorists groups like Al Qaeda.  Americans are literally paying to put
bullets in Taliban AK-47s.

But our reliance on foreign oil does more than fund our enemies. The CIA and
Pentagon<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/09/science/earth/09climate.html?_r=2&hp>say
that the droughts, famines, and rising sea levels caused by climate
change pose perhaps the greatest destabilizing influence the world will face
over the next 50 years.

Without forceful and decisive action, conflict will erupt among climate
refugees competing for dwindling resources and political destabilization
will create ungoverned spaces where terrorists can flourish.

We must act now.  The Senate will be deciding to take up climate legislation
in the next few weeks, and Senator Kay Hagan needs to hear from the faith
community on this vital issue for our future and security.   Please email
Senator Kay Hagan by clicking here. <http://hagan.senate.gov/?p=contact>
And let her know who you are and that your faith and love of country compel
you to encourage her to do the right thing and support the bi-partisan
effort by Senator Graham and Senator Lieberman and Senator Kerry to create a
bill that will create American jobs, keep America safe, and protect God's
creation.

Thank you,

*Brigadier General John Watkins*


Rev. Joel Hunter

Listen to Rev. Joel Hunter's Christian Radio ad calling Christians to
ensure
the climate bill reflects our values.
