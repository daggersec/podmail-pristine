Here's a shorter version:


Hillary believes that any new trade measure has to pass two tests: First,
does it put us in a position to protect American workers, raise wages and
create more good jobs at home? Second, does it also strengthen our national
security?  We should be willing to walk away from any outcome that falls
short of these tests.  The goal is greater prosperity and security for
American families, not trade for trade=E2=80=99s sake. Hillary will be watc=
hing
closely to see what is being done to crack down on currency manipulation,
improve labor rights, protect the environment, and open new opportunities
for our small businesses to export overseas.  As she warned in her book,
Hard Choices, we shouldn=E2=80=99t be giving special rights to corporations=
 at the
expense of workers and consumers.
