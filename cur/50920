Yes!  It was a huge success and brought in at least $5
million--probably more.  The NYC events really buoyed our income last
week and much of the revenue last week and this week was from west
coast donors. So it's all in there, it's just spread out over the last
10 days.  But if you look at the last two weeks compared to a few days
after the launch (see 4/15-17), you can see the difference your events
make.  And we are on track so far to recruit the number of raisers we
need.  The donor summit this week will be critical to getting raisers
to bring in another 25k each.
We are far ahead of revenue projections right now, but June will be a
big test of our digital capacity. I'm confident no matter what that we
will meet our goal, I just want to make sure our digital list grows
rapidly as well.  We are experimenting with different acquisition
techniques in June and should have a well informed strategy for the
summer.
Also, we have some interesting ideas to discuss with you next week
about how to shift costs this year.
So--big picture--this week was exactly what we needed and a bit more!
