In the op ed or the speech?

The change we requested in the op ed for the online version is this:

But for every Republican governor working to dismantle voting rights across
our country, there are Americans determined to keep marching forward.
I=E2=80=99m proud
of everyone in Alabama who leapt to confront this injustice. The outcry has
been so strong, it=E2=80=99s forced politicians in Montgomery to reconsider=
.  Governor
Bentley and the legislature should listen to their constituents.  Those
offices should stay open =E2=80=93 and not just one day a month.
