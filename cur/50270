Quiver Before Our Suspendered Overlord
By Spencer Ackerman 9/2/08 5:08 PM

John McCain tells us he's going to stand up to Vladimir Putin and chase bin=
 Laden to the "gates of hell" and fight until who-knows-when in Iraq and so=
 forth. But there is one tyrant on this earth who makes even McCain tremble=
? Larry King. Eric Kleefeld:

    Wolf Blitzer just reported that the campaign has cancelled a scheduled =
interview with Larry King due to an unfriendly segment last night on CNN - =
the segment we flagged last night where the network's Campbell Brown grille=
d McCain spokesperson Tucker bounds over Sarah Palin's lack of foreign poli=
cy experience.

Look, I'm afraid of Larry King myself. After his calming intonation dulls m=
y senses, I fear being too lethargic to withstand his noogies and attempts =
at biting me with his dentures. (I know: eww!) Of course, I don't campaign =
for president as a mucho-macho muchacho, so it might not be the same thing.

P.S., I saw that thanks to John Aravosis.

falling apart and even Larry King might notice that.

	But, pass it around.  This campaign has officially passed from joke territ=
ory into offensive territory.  McCain can't handle an interview with Larry =
King?  And he's gonna stare down Ahmadinejad?
