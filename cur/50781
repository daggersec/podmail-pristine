Here are the notes from my call with our tracker Jessica who made it into
today's media availability in Coral Gables, FL ...
*
Background Details:
*- Media availability held in same location as fundraiser; a very very nice
hotel
- Protesters were outside of hotel -- one of the signs held by the
protesters said 'McSame'
- Not very much press -- only 6 cameras and half of the press were local
press; the usual reporters, Dana Bash and Carl Cameron were not there
- Very tight security -- Secret Service went through bags, had dogs sniff
them out; Secret Service were dispersed over the entire, multi-building
hotel
- McCain has new press staffers with him at events; now there is 2-3 staff
present to deal with press; before there was only 1
- Cindy McCain was standing next to John McCain during the media
availability
*
Media Availability:*
- McCain first spoke for a few minutes -- called out Obama and said Obama
doesn't understand that certain tax cuts are good for the American people
and bad for special interests
- McCain said that with his gas tax holiday -- the special interests reacted
such that you would have that it was the end of civilization
- Question: Lots of older people working past their retirement, what are
your thoughts?
Answer: Social Security in place for current retirees -- those benefits
may/will not be there for younger generations, but I'll fix that; he'll work
with the other side to make that happen; he'll reach across the aisle
- McCain said the first thing we need to do is eliminate wasteful,
pork-barrel spending
- Question: Brought up that McCain doesn't really wear a flag-pin; also
brought up how Obama doesn't wear one; is that a fair issue for people to
bring up and why don't you wear one?
Answer: Sometimes when you go to certain states -- I'll wear the state flag;
but I will not criticize Obama for not wearing a flag-pin
- Question: Would you prefer to face Barack or Hillary?
Answer: McCain said he doesn't have a preference and he doesn't control the
Democratic race
- Question: This week is going to be a big health care week -- mentioned
specifically chronic diseases -- thoughts?
Answer: McCain said 75% of health care costs go to chronic diseases
- Question: someone brought up how he was doing/ or has done a fundraiser
with big Jewish donors that typically vote for Democrats -- are you hoping
to get the Jewish vote?
Answer: McCain said he's seeking the vote of all Americans; many in the
Jewish community are committed to the state of Israel and he said he's been
to Israel and he knows their leaders; then he said Barack Obama has little
if any experience when it comes to foreign policy
- Question: Draft? Thoughts on that if elected? Also what are your thoughts
on Hillary's Iran comments?
Answer: McCain said there's no necessity for the reinstatement of the draft;
in regards to Iran, there are many options -- "serious and effective" ones;
then he brought up his league of democracies idea and diplomatic trade and
economic sanctions as options in dealing with Iran
- Question: Obama said that McCain's conscience took a flight when he
flip-flopped on Bush's tax cuts -- reporter asked for a comment
Answer: McCain said that his record is very clear; both proposals to cut
spending and fiscal restraint; said he's been opposed to tax increases
throughout his career; Obama wants to double the capital gains tax and he
has no understanding about the economy and he's insensitive to Americans'
hopes and dreams
- Question: NC GOP ad and his actions he's continuing to take to stop it?
Answer: McCain said he stated his position very clearly, then he started
talking about Rev. Jeremiah Wright -- and quoted outrageous comments said by
Wright -- basically fueling the Jeremiah Wright controversy; Mccain said he
understands why people are angry -- Sen. Obama is out of touch and McCain
doesn't want to be the referee anymore
- Question: Asked about using his wife's corporate jet -- and does that
conflict with his position on campaign finance reform?
Answer: McCain said -- 'It's perfectly legal and appropriate'
- Question: Have you called the NC GOP yourself?
Answer: McCain said -- no, but my aides have
- Question: What kind of action would he take if NC still chooses to run the
ad?  Would he punish NC at the GOP convention?
Answer: McCain said no he would not take any action at the convention; he's
running his own campaign and he's made his position clear
- Question: Asked about Cuba and how people are getting a lot more access
with cell phones and stuff - how does McCain see that?
Answer: McCain said it's so amazing that people haven't had cell phones --
and he doesn't know how to read it
- Question: McCain has said that he won't make the Jeremiah Wright issue an
issue, but Obama today said that it should be an issue -- McCain's thoughts?
Answer: McCain said that he would not have any comment on it and then said
that Sen. Obama doesn't share the same views; and mentioned that Sen. Obama
said it should be an issue
- Question: More stuff coming out about Jeremiah Wright -- thoughts?
Answer: McCain said he was disturbed
- Question: Would McCain use his clout to get Republicans to back off on the
NC GOP ad/Jeremiah Wright?
Answer: Obama said it was a legitimate issue
