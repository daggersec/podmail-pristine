Dear John,

Wow! What a great week for the campaign=2E

Last week we learned that Glenn is in a two-person race that's all tied=
 up with Glenn leading in the polls in Prince George's County=2E And ju=
st last night we learned that thanks to our sprawling network of grassr=
oots supporters, Glenn raised TWICE as much money as our nearest compet=
itor in the polls for the 4th quarter and has nearly twice as much cash=
 on hand=2E

I cannot stress enough how important this win is for our campaign and i=
t's all thanks to supporters like you=2E We really could not be in such=
 a strong position to win without you=2E So thank you!!

This has easily been the best week for the campaign, but we can't get c=
omplacent=2E We can't get comfortable=2E We owe it to ourselves and to =
the residents of the 4th district to keep pushing=2E We must keep our h=
eads down and stay focused or all that we've accomplished will be for n=
othing=2E=C2=A0

Together we've captured the momentum of this race=2E Now you have to he=
lp us keep it=2E=C2=A0

We can't win without you=2E I hope we can still count on you as we ente=
r the final stretch=2E www=2Eiveyforcongress=2Ecom/contribute

Ever grateful,

Jesse Hassinger
Campaign Manager
Glenn Ivey for Congress
