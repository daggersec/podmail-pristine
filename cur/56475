Friend,

What's Bruce Rauner telling people behind closed doors?
=20
Last week, not one but TWO separate videos surfaced of Rauner telling s=
upporters that he may have to shut down the government in order to get =
his way=2E
=20
Those are Bruce Rauner's words, not mine -- and he said it twice=2E
=20
A government shutdown would be devastating for our state=2E It would pu=
t tens of thousands of people out of work, suspend vital services, and =
knock our economy off track=2E  =20
=20
We can't let that happen -- chip in $5 or more today to make sure Raune=
r doesn't get the chance to make good on his threats:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/shutdown
=20
We saw what happened when Republicans in Washington tried this, and we =
saw what happened when Scott Walker went to war against workers in Wisc=
onsin=2E=20
=20
That's the last thing we need in Illinois=2E=20
=20
It won't happen with Pat Quinn as Governor=2E But with Bruce Rauner at =
the helm, it could=2E=20
=20
That's why this fight is so important=2E=20
=20
Chip in right now:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/shutdown

Thanks=2E
