Opponents of health insurance reform have power. Some reap huge profits =
from the status quo. Others take large campaign contributions from those =
who profit.

So they'll do anything to keep the current system in place. When =
fact-based arguments don't work, they attack President Obama with =
outlandish lies about a government takeover and euthanizing the elderly. =
And once that doesn't work, they'll go even further.
=20
We don't know what they'll do next. What we do know is that we'll have to =
be prepared for anything -- ready to set the record straight, ready to =
make sure the media and Congress see the overwhelming support for reform, =
and ready to pass real reform this year.
=20
But we'll need the resources to do it -- to pay for rapid-response ads in =
key districts and states, organizers to put together large rallies and =
grassroots events throughout the country, and the best technology =
available to empower volunteers -- all at a moment's notice. Please chip =
in $5 or more to help us pass real reform, this year:

https://donate.barackobama.com/power4
=20
This was never going to be easy.  As candidate Obama said just three days =
before the election: "Don't think for a moment that power will concede =
without a fight." Now, we're seeing how true that really is.
=20
These same well-financed forces have killed reform in the past, and =
they're aiming to do it again.
=20
But here's why this time can be different: There are folks like you, all =
around the country, who are ready to go toe-to-toe with the special =
interests, even when they're not fighting fair.
=20
And we'll keep at it, because we know that the work we're doing together =
right now can make the lives of hundreds of millions better for decades to =
come.
=20
But we need your help to keep it up. Please donate $5 or more to help beat =
the special interests:

https://donate.barackobama.com/power4

There's too much at stake for any of us to sit this one out. Please chip =
in.

Thanks,
