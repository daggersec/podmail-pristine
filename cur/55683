After Boehner told our blogger "I don't know" whether lobbyists would be at=
tending the House Republicans' conference, we confirmed that  Republican "h=
eavyweight" lobbyists representing JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, AHIP, WellPoin=
t, BlueCross/BlueShield, BP and others were in attendance at the GOP confer=
ence, where House Republicans discuss policy ideas. And despite Boehner's c=
alls for transparency<http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/rep=
ublicans-fault-obama-on-transparency/>, our blogger was threatened with arr=
est if he did not leave the premises where the GOP's closed-door meetings w=
ith corporate lobbyists were being held. According to the event organizers,=
 the lobbyists stayed overnight and left this morning<http://abcnews.go.com=
/print?id=3D9690254>.

VIDEO: Boehner Feigns Ignorance That His GOP Retreat Is Attended By Goldman=
 Sachs, Other Corporate Lobbyists<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/01/29/boehn=
er-lies-lobbyists/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2010/01/29/boehner-lies-lobbyists/

This weekend, Republican leaders will convene<http://abcnews.go.com/print?i=
d=3D9690254> at the Renaissance Harborplace Hotel in Baltimore to plot stra=
tegy, socialize, and plan both legislative and campaign themes for the year=
. Yesterday morning, ThinkProgress caught up with House Republican Leader J=
ohn Boehner (R-OH), who confirmed that the Congressional Institute - a nonp=
rofit run by Republican corporate lobbyists<http://www.sourcewatch.org/inde=
x.php?title=3DCongressional_Institute> - is sponsoring the retreat. Normall=
y, such lobbyist-sponsored soir=E9es would be illegal under House ethics ru=
les. But by forming an ostensibly nonpartisan educational front called the =
Congressional Institute, lobbyists are able to skirt any such oversight<htt=
p://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/22/lobbyists-who-pay-25000-g_n_160142.ht=
ml>. However, Boehner told ThinkProgress that he did not know if any lobbyi=
sts would be present at the retreat:

TP: For your retreat this weekend, is the Congressional Institute attending=
 or sponsoring at all?

BOEHNER: They've always sponsored retreats for both Democrats and Republica=
ns.

TP: Are any of their lobbyists attending this weekend?

BOEHNER: I don't know. [...] I said I don't know.

Watch it:

Boehner is wrong when he claims that the Congressional Institute sponsors D=
emocratic retreats. According to the Politico<http://www.politico.com/news/=
stories/0209/18408.html>, House Democratic retreats are not paid for by any=
 special interest funds or the lobbyist-run Congressional Institute.

To fact-check Boehner's sheepish reply that he simply didn't know if lobbyi=
sts would be at the retreat, I visited the Renaissance hotel in Baltimore y=
esterday afternoon. Upon arriving at the front desk, I spoke to Patrick Dei=
tz, a staff assistant for the Congressional Institute, who confirmed that C=
ongressional Institute board member Michael Johnson was upstairs at the ret=
reat, and that Dan Meyer<http://www.cah.utexas.edu/db/dmr/image_lg.php?vari=
able=3De_pfb_0017>, another board member, was on his way. Johnson, a lobbyi=
st at the OB-C Group, touts himself as a "Republican heavyweight<http://www=
.ob-cgroup.com/aboutus/professionals/michael-s-johnson>" whose firm represe=
nts<http://www.ob-cgroup.com/clients> the Blue Cross Blue Shield Associatio=
n, JP Morgan Chase, and the health insurance giant WellPoint. Meyer, a long=
time Republican operative and chairman of the Congressional Institute, work=
s for the Duberstein Group, where he represents BP, Goldman Sachs, HealthNe=
t, and AHIP, the umbrella trade group for the health insurance industry. Me=
yer's colleague at his lobbying firm, Steve Champlin, urged insurance indus=
try executives last year to fight ruthless to kill health reform, proclaimi=
ng, don't "give comfort to the enemy<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/22/ah=
ip-enemy-reform/> who is down."

After informing Deitz and other Congressional Institute staffers that I wor=
k for ThinkProgress and wanted to interview some of the lobbyists in attend=
ance, another staffer, named Mary, told me to leave the building or else I =
would be arrested. Mary, who refused to give her business card or last name=
, told Deitz not to tell me his last name either. During the course of the =
conversation with Congressional Institute staffers, a gaggle of men dressed=
 in business attire discussed technology policy behind me. One of them had =
a name tag that read John Sampson; who according to his LinkedIn profile is=
 the chief lobbyist<http://www.linkedin.com/pub/john-sampson/4/971/9b2> for=
 Microsoft.

Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that ThinkProgress will be able to attend,=
 or even approach the building, for the lobbyist-organized GOP retreat. If =
we could, we might witness quite a reunion. Many of the lobbyists running t=
he Congressional Institute are former top staffers to Newt Gingrich, who is=
 addressing<http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-md.gop28jan28,0,1=
714314.story> the gathering. Here is a picture<http://www.cah.utexas.edu/db=
/dmr/image_lg.php?variable=3De_pfb_0017> of Congressional Institute board m=
embers Meyer and Arne Christenson - now a lobbyist for American Express - p=
lotting strategy for Gingrich back in 1995.

Responding to the State of the Union, Boehner was quick to attack the admin=
istration for supposedly lacking transparency<http://prescriptions.blogs.ny=
times.com/2010/01/27/republicans-fault-obama-on-transparency/>. But for a r=
etreat planning public policy, Boehner apparently prefers to keep the corpo=
rate lobbyists involved behind closed doors - and even refuses to acknowled=
ge their attendance.
