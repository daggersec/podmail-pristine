Friend,

Yesterday, I stood with my friend Martin Sheen to make the case for why=
 we should raise the minimum wage in Illinois=2E

Martin knows this issue is about justice as much as economics, and he u=
nderstands the power of grassroots movements to make change=2E

Take a look at his message below, then add your name in support of rais=
ing the wage:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/add-your-name-now

Thank you=2E

Governor Quinn

From: Martin Sheen
Subject: I=E2=80=99m asking you, right now:

Friend,

I=E2=80=99ve been extraordinarily lucky in my career as an actor, but I=
 don=E2=80=99t believe good fortune should make you forget your roots=2E

I know what it means to work hard and still barely make ends meet=2E My=
 parents came to this country in pursuit of a better life, and they man=
aged to raise 10 healthy, happy children on next to nothing=2E

If that's not what the American Dream is all about, then I don't know w=
hat is=2E

But today that dream is at risk for millions, in part because of a mini=
mum wage that hasn=E2=80=99t kept up with the times and no longer provi=
des a stable base for a good life=2E

I'm back in Illinois today to join my friend, Governor Quinn, in his fi=
ght to raise the minimum wage=2E

Will you join us by adding your name today in support of raising the wa=
ge?

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/add-your-name-now

I truly believe raising the minimum wage is one of the most important i=
ssues facing our country, and Illinois needs to lead the way=2E

This is about more than politics=2E It=E2=80=99s about making sure that=
 no one -- young or old, Democrat or Republican -- who works full time =
has to live in poverty=2E

I'm asking you, right now, to make sure your state is on the right side=
 of history=2E

If you're standing with Governor Quinn and me on raising the minimum wa=
ge, then please add your name right now:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/add-your-name-now

And thanks so much=2E

upation and name of the employer be reported for any individual who con=
tributes over $500=2E Taxpayers for Quinn does not accept contributions=
 from State employees=2E In addition, the Illinois Procurement Code pro=
hibits certain businesses and their affiliates that have contracts, bid=
