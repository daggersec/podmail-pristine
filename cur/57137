I huddled briefly with HRC today to talk big picture and some next steps.
Two things to relay:

1) I told her I wanted to do a better job aligning with her on the
organization--before we worry about hiring, let's just spend time getting
comfortable with a theory of how the campaign should be structured.  I
suggested we start spending as much time as we can over the next few weeks
reviewing/discussing/revising the org charts so she can start forming a
point of view on organizational structure.  I want to get completely
aligned on exactly what roles we think we need, what purpose they serve,
and what kind of people we're looking for.  Then we can ratify an interview
process and drill down on the prospect lists.  She said she felt ready to
start doing that.

2) We talked more about pollsters and the message process.  She wants to
include Benenson and I recommended that he be in an advisor role...but
obviously he can also do some of the work if we want.  There's a
fundamental conflict of interest with his WH work, so it's better to start
small and get bigger if we're comfortable.  She's meeting with Pollock and
Anzalone this coming week...she seems inclined just to have Pollock and
Benenson at this point.  Based on the discussion with Wendy, I'm going to
get back to her with a plan for the research process as a whole.
