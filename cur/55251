John --

I wanted to take a minute to reinforce Barack's message.

We wouldn't be preparing to celebrate this historic inauguration if it =
weren't for you.  But the deadline to get your ticket to history is just a =
few hours away.

Time and again you have stepped up to support this movement in inspiring =
ways.  Now you can help give this administration a strong start.

Ten supporters and their guests will be selected to come to Washington, =
D.C., and attend the welcome ceremony, the swearing in, the Inaugural =
Parade, and the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball.

Make a donation of $5 or more before midnight tonight and you could be a =
part of the inaugural events:

https://donate.pic2009.org/tickettohistory26

You believed in Barack's message of change and helped build the grassroots =
movement that made history.

No matter where you are on Inauguration Day, we'll all come together and =
remember why we put so much work into making this happen.

Thank you for everything,

David

------Original Message------
From: Barack Obama
Subject: Deadline: Midnight

John --

On January 20th, our journey to bring change will officially begin.

We're organizing the most open and accessible inauguration in our nation's =
history. And we're doing it without contributions from Washington =
lobbyists or big corporations.

Just like we did on the campaign, we're relying entirely on supporters =
like you -- ordinary people giving whatever they can afford to make this =
an event for all Americans.

I know we've asked a lot of you. But changing the way business is done in =
Washington will take a commitment from all of us. Right now, you can help =
give this administration a strong start.

And if you make a donation of any amount before midnight tonight, you =
could be selected to come to Washington, D.C., and be part of the welcome =
ceremony, the swearing in, the Inaugural Parade, and the Inaugural =
Community Ball.

Make a donation of $5 or more and be part of the historic moment you made =
possible:

https://donate.pic2009.org/tickettohistory26

We have a long road ahead of us, and we're going to face some major =
challenges as soon as we start. But I know I can count on you every step =
of the way.

Thank you for everything you've done and happy New Year,

Barack

P.S. -- You could be there for this historic moment even if you cannot =
