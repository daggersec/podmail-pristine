Hope this email finds you well.=C2=A0 My name is Kevin Spinella, and I am a=
<br>
rising second year law student at Georgetown. I am writing in regard<br>
to the school&#39;s supervised research offering, where law students work<b=
r>
independently on a research paper under the supervision of a faculty<br>
member for two graded credits in order to fulfill their upper-class<br>
legal writing requirement. In that vein, I was wondering if you would<br>
be willing to serve as my faculty supervisor beginning in the fall or<br>
spring (or perhaps both).<br>
<br>
The subject of the paper would be election law, and specifically, a<br>
tentative thesis could examine &quot;Evenwel v. Abbott: One Person, One<br>
Vote, the Future of Legislative Redistricting, and the Impact on the<br>
Balance of State Political Power.&quot; In the Supreme Court&#39;s recent<b=
r>
ruling maintaining an Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) in<br>
Arizona as constitutional, state limits on partisan gerrymandering<br>
were sustained.=C2=A0 However, in the forthcoming &quot;Evenwel&quot; Supre=
me Court<br>
case, the definition of equality of representation as equal numbers of<br>
people in comparison to equal numbers of voters in legislative<br>
districts will be examined. Depending on the ruling, this decision<br>
could alter the balance of state and congressional representative<br>
political power going forward, especially in upcoming 2016 elections.<br>
<br>
As both a professor and election practitioner, there is no better<br>
faculty member to supervise on this subject than you.=C2=A0 I envision the<=
br>
topic of this paper to be outside the scope of your spring course<br>
offering (which is already filled).=C2=A0 If this topic or thesis<br>
suggestion is not acceptable, I would also be interested in writing on<br>
other election law topics or other related areas as you see fit.<br>
Ultimately, this decision resides with the faculty supervisor. In<br>
terms of logistics, it is my understanding that many if not most of<br>
the supervised research meetings between the professor and student can<br>
take place remotely, especially as many visiting professors have<br>
numerous other professional and/or travel engagements. At the<br>
conclusion of the term(s), the student must submit a final paper to<br>
the registrar for a grade. The process is straightforward and is<br>
designed to accommodate the schedule and needs of faculty.<br>
<br>
I have spoken in person with Margaret Gerety, Director of the J.D.<br>
Program at Georgetown, as well as Louis Fine, Manager of Directed<br>
Registration, Office of the Registrar. I have also spoken with Daniel<br>
LaMagna, Academic Records Coordinator (all of the above are cc&#39;d<br>
here).=C2=A0 Each has provided both permission and encouragement to reach<b=
r>
out to you in this endeavor.=C2=A0 Moreover, if you have any additional<br>
questions, feel free to reach out to myself or them.<br>
<br>
Many thanks in advance for your consideration; it is much appreciated.<br>
Hope you are having an enjoyable summer, and I look forward to hearing<br>
from you soon.<br>
<br>
