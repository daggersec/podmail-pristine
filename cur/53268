*FEC Eases Rules on Ads Before Elections* - By JIM KUHNHENN:  WASHINGTON
(AP) =97 Unions and businesses may pay for TV and radio "issue ads" that na=
me
candidates in the days before elections, federal regulators said Tuesday,
easing previous restrictions and opening the way for interest groups to
influence next year's elections with big-money advertising campaigns.  Full

*FEC To Decide Rules On Campaign Ads:*  Television and radio advertisements
for next year's presidential election are about to get a whole lot more
interesting. On Tuesday, the Federal Election Commission could determine
whether corporations and labor unions must disclose their funding efforts
for certain political ads. The FEC is scheduled to figure out how best to
implement a highly controversial Supreme Court ruling from earlier this yea=
r
that seemingly makes it easier for businesses and organized labor to
influence the public through "issue" ads--which don't focus on a specific
candidate--in the days before an election. Full

*In Wake of Court Ruling, FEC Makes Financing Rule Change Official:  *The
Federal Election Commission has reopened the door for corporations and
unions to pay for television commercials during the upcoming presidential
and congressional campaigns, so long as the ads avoid expressly advocating
for or against a candidate.  The new rules come in response to a recent
Supreme Court decision that knocked out a key provision of the landmark 200=
2
legislation overhauling the nation's campaign finance laws. The law
prohibited issue advertising, paid for with corporate or union money, that
named a candidate -- 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general
election -- and was considered by its supporters to be one of the bright
lines in the act governing the role special interest groups may play in an
election.  The new rules are expected to revive the practice by unions and
special interest groups of airing ads during a campaign that purport to be
about a specific issue, but are in fact intended to sway voters for or away
from a particular candidate.  Full
