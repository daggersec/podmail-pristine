Professors,



Here is a brief explanation of my paper topic and why it interests me.



I would like to analyze the historical precedent in the House and Senate
for unilateral authority to subpoena, depose, or otherwise meet with
witnesses, without support from the ranking member or a vote of the
committee.  I plan to apply this precedent to the Benghazi Committee
chairman=E2=80=99s decision to unilaterally subpoena witnesses.



I am interested in this question because my initial research and our class
discussions shows that chairs have very rarely chosen to unilaterally
subpoena witnesses.  I would like to better understand the circumstanced
under which committee chairs made this decision in the past and what
implications it had on the legitimacy of their investigations.



Best,

Mark Iozzi
