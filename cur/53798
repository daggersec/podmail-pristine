The following is an op-ed from New Way for New Jersey Chair Phil Murphy, =
published by the Star-Ledger on Friday, January 22:=20
Murphy: How could law-and-order candidate Christie allow terrorists to buy =
guns?

By Phil Murphy=20

Gov. Chris Christie's presidential ambitions may be beneficial for his =
career but they have grown more toxic for the residents of New Jersey with =
each passing day.

The most recent example of this governor subverting the will of his =
constituents is his inexplicable decision to pocket veto a measure that =
would prevent gang members, carjackers and those making terroristic =
threats from buying a gun.

Christie, a former U.S. Attorney who is boasting about his law and order =
bona fides on the presidential campaign trail, apparently sees nothing =
wrong with allowing criminals to possess firearms.=20

We need only to hear the news of daily mass shootings across the county to =
understand how vulnerable we are to gun violence. Much of the reason New =
Jersey is generally sheltered from the worst of this plague is because of =
our strong gun laws -- laws like the ban on assault weapons, the =
preservation of which Christie once cited as the reason he got into =
politics.=20

New Jersey law bars many criminals from buying guns. Now Christie has =
vetoed a bill that would add gang members and carjackers to the list. He =
offered no explanation, and now leaves against for New Hampshire.

But that was long ago, before the governor grew more concerned with =
currying favor with the National Rifle Association and extremists in his =
own party in Iowa and New Hampshire than with protecting his constituents.

Today, the former U.S. Attorney who prosecuted gang members sees no =
problem with allowing them to possess a gun. Even as he provides empty =
platitudes about keeping our homeland safe, he allows those who make =
terroristic threats to buy a weapon. Have we not learned that those who =
make those threats sometimes act on them -- with devastating consequences?

Rather than kowtowing to the NRA for his own benefit, the governor should =
be working to strengthen New Jersey's gun laws. We should require every =
single person who purchases a gun to undergo gun safety training, much as =
we require everyone who drives a car to demonstrate first that they can do =
it safely.=20

For the second time in a span of less than four days, Gov. Chris Christie =
changed his position on when and how he did a turnaround on supporting New =
Jersey's semiautomatic weapons ban.

We should make it a felony to give or sell a gun to anyone without first =
conducting a background check to ensure that the recipient is legally =
allowed to own a firearm -- and exclude gang members and those who =
threaten terrorism from being on that list.=20

These are all common-sense solutions and they have overwhelming bipartisan =
support. In fact, not one member of the governor's own party voted against =
the legislation to bar gang members, carjackers and potential terrorists =
from owning a firearm.=20

These proposals are also rooted in reality-based assumptions. A =
Connecticut law prohibiting felons from purchasing handguns and mandating =
background checks and gun safety courses has been associated with a 40 =
percent decline in gun-related deaths. Surely, there is no reason why we =
here in New Jersey cannot follow suit in saving the lives of our =
residents.=20

Most reasonable people across the state and the nation would agree -- but =
Gov. Christie has long stopped caring about what the people of New Jersey =
have to say if it conflicts with the views of the most extreme slice of =
the electorate that he believes will help him receive the presidential =
nomination.

This, of course, is the problem with having an officeholder who won't =
finish the job he was elected to do before looking for a promotion. =
Suddenly, the wishes of his own constituents become irrelevant when they =
conflict with his ambition. We see this time and again from professional =
politicians and it is always a tragedy that ends poorly. ----
