John --
=20
Climate deniers are everywhere in Congress -- and OFA
supporters just drew another one out into the light.

Volunteers have held nearly 100 planning sessions, and had 50
events across the country last week to start the conversation
on climate with their legislators.

Get this -- following one of these events, a reporter in Missouri
tracked down a letter from Rep. Ann Wagner to a blogger, outing
herself as yet another lawmaker who doesn't believe in the
overwhelming science on this issue. The reporter confirmed the
statements in the letter with the congresswoman's office.

That's exactly why organizing -- and actually raising our voices
-- on climate change matters. And it's not all bad news: Dozens
of congressional offices expressed their support during last
week's Day of Action on climate, and committed to the fight in
the months ahead.

Couldn't make it to an event last week? Don't worry -- there
will be plenty more chances for you to get involved this summer.

Add your name -- and join the team that's working to change
the conversation on climate:

http://my.barackobama.com/Hold-Climate-Deniers-Accountable

There are still many folks out there who question the basic fact
that climate change is real -- some very influential members of
Congress have even called it a hoax.

We're working to make sure that, at every step of the way, the
Ann Wagners of the world will have to answer to their
constituents on why they don't believe in science.

Be sure to join the fight to hold climate deniers accountable:

http://my.barackobama.com/Hold-Climate-Deniers-Accountable

Keep up the great work.

Thanks,

Ivan
