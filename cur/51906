Pelosi distances Dems from Sanders's plan to raise taxes

Democrats are not on board with the tax hikes Democratic presidential
candidate Bernie Sanders has proposed to pay for his single-payer
healthcare proposal, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said
Wednesday.

"We're not running on any platform of raising taxes," Pelosi said during a
press briefing to launch the Democrats' yearly issues conference in
Baltimore, Md. "We do want to have a fairer tax system, and =E2=80=A6 we ho=
pe that
we can do that this year."

Sanders on Monday acknowledged that his "Medicare-for-all" healthcare plan
would require tax hikes on the middle class.

=E2=80=9CWe will raise taxes, yes we will,=E2=80=9D Sanders said during a D=
emocratic town
hall in Des Moines, Iowa.

The Vermont senator, who's running neck and neck with front-runner Hillary
Clinton in Iowa just days ahead of the state's caucuses, emphasized that
the individual savings achieved under his healthcare plan would offset the
costs of the tax increase. He called critics of the strategy =E2=80=9Cdisin=
genuous.=E2=80=9D

Clinton supporters were quick to pounce, saying Sanders's plan differs from
her vow not to raise taxes on middle income Americans.

Pelosi was quick to note that she's supported the single-payer strategy for
decades. But the nation's healthcare system has evolved in a different
direction, she said, and the political conditions are simply not ripe to
scrap the existing infrastructure in favor of Medicare-for-all.

"He's talking about a single-payer, and that's not going to happen. I mean,
does anybody in this room think that we're going to be discussing a
single-payer?" she asked. "I've been for single-payer for 30 years, and it
is a very popular idea in our country. But we have made a decision about
where we're going on healthcare."

Pelosi, who was a crucial force in ushering the Affordable Care Act through
Congress in 2009 and 2010, said she's "proud" of the achievement, citing
the millions of uninsured Americans who have gained access to health
coverage under the law.

"It has achieved the goal of affordable, quality, accessible healthcare for
many millions more Americans. It is lowering the cost of healthcare in our
country," she said.

Pelosi said the Democrats fought to ensure that the healthcare law included
features that are "attractive about single-payer," including provisions
barring insurance companies from excluding patients based on pre-existing
conditions or establishing lifetime limits on coverage. She conceded
imperfections in the law and vowed to work on improvements.

"We have a very realistic plan that's out there," she said. "Can it be
improved upon? Everything can. But it's no use having a conversation about
something that's not going to happen.

"Right now we're proud of what we have," she said, "and want to build upon
that."

Pelosi, who as Speaker of the House was the highest-ranking female elected
official in the nation's history, has repeatedly hailed the notion of
having a woman in the White House. But unlike many of her top lieutenants,
she has not endorsed a primary candidate, choosing instead to highlight the
"shared values" of the three Democratic contenders.

On Wednesday she amplified that message, calling on Democrats of all
persuasions to come to the polls in November =E2=80=94 regardless of which =
name
tops the ballot.

"The fact is that Bernie Sanders is enlarging the universe of people who
are paying attention to the election, and we hope that he will bring them
to the polls in November to support the Democratic nominee," she said.

"There are differences of opinion in terms of approach, but every one of
our candidates shares =E2=80=A6 concern about all Americans participating i=
n the
full prosperity of our country."

The Democrats' issues conference, running through Friday, adopts a theme of
unity the leaders are hoping will draw stark contrasts with a Republican
conference that's been sharply divided in recent years on major policy
issues, particularly government spending.

Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the Democratic whip, chastised the Republicans for
focusing their legislative agenda on efforts to undo President Obama's
achievements without offering alternatives of their own.

"Sixty-two times repealing the Affordable Care Act is not sufficient,"
Hoyer said Wednesday. "They need to show what they want to replace it with
and let the American public understand the consequences of their
proposals."

Both President Obama and Vice President Biden are scheduled to address the
Democrats in Baltimore.
