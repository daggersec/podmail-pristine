Donate to Mark Udall and Tom Udall before the June 30th FEC deadline. Presi=

John,

To bolster his climate action plan, President Obama needs Tom Udall and Mar=
k Udall in the Senate. Chip in before the June 30th FEC deadline to help th=
em win: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D4Oob86f4l7ORuf8HQThD-g .

This can't wait. Two of our key environmental allies in the Senate are like=
ly to be top targets for Karl Rove and the Koch brothers next year --  New =
Mexico Senator Tom Udall and Colorado Senator Mark Udall.

Simply put, our environment just can't afford to lose champions like Mark a=
nd Tom Udall. With President Obama moving forward on a bold climate action =
plan, we need strong allies in the Senate ready to roll up their sleeves, t=
ake on corporate polluters, and make real change.

To help Tom and Mark get ahead -- and stay ahead -- they need the help of c=
ommitted LCV supporters like you. Early money will win races and that's why=
 every dollar counts.

Will you chip in with a contribution to Mark and Tom Udall's re-election ca=
mpaigns? You can make your gift via LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen: http://act=
ion.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D0S0e1FGb9NJ569cwl3Zwqw .

As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Colorado Senator=
 Mark Udall has worked to protect public lands and the renewable energy ind=
ustry that is so important to Colorado's economy. His top energy priorities=
 are growing the renewable energy sector and increasing energy efficiency. =
Mark has been a long-time champion on climate and clean energy policy and e=
arned a 97% lifetime score from LCV.

As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Tom Udall also r=
ecognizes the need to protect our public lands and water resources, which i=
s why he authored legislation that became law to protect 16,000 acres in Ne=
w Mexico as wilderness. Tom has earned an excellent 96% lifetime score on L=
CV's National Environmental Scorecard.

Tom and Mark Udall have been among the strongest and most influential voice=
s on environmental issues in the Senate. President Obama needs them there. =
And we need them there. LCV Action Fund helped get them to the Senate in 20=
08. They are two of the strongest leaders on clean energy, climate policy, =
and the protection of natural resources.

That's why I'm asking LCV supporters like you to contribute to Tom and Mark=
 Udall's reelection campaigns now.

I hope you'll join me in making sure they have the early resources their ca=
mpaigns need to win. Will you chip in with a contribution today?

Thanks so much for supporting Tom Udall, Mark Udall, and all our GiveGreen =
candidates.

Best,

Gene
