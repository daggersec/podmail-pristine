> Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton campaigns for U.S. Sen. Mar=
y Landrieu (D-LA) during the "Women with Mary Geaux Vote" event at the Sugar=
 Mill, Nov. 1, 2014 in New Orleans.Stacy Revere/Getty Images
> For the past five years, a prominent Democratic operative who is a leading=
 contender to manage a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign has maintained a=
 private email listserv for friends and associates that carries a provocativ=
e name: the =E2=80=9CMook Mafia.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> The listserv, which one member said reaches more than 150 fellow campaign v=
eterans, has been a means for Robby Mook and a close friend Marlon Marshall t=
o stay connected with many of the operatives who would likely populate a Dem=
ocratic presidential campaign in 2016. Mook and Marshall have both been ment=
ioned as possible Hillary Clinton campaign managers.
>=20
>  Emilys List/Flickr=20

5, 2010 file photo.

> President Obama receives an update on the Affordable Care Act in the Oval O=
ffice, April 1, 2014. With the President, from left, are: Phil Schiliro, Tar=
a McGuinness, Marlon Marshall, Jeanne Lambrew, DKristie Canegallo and Senior=
 Advisor Valerie Jarrett.
> Copies of a cache of the emails obtained by ABC News, and revealed publicl=
y for the first time, show Mook and Marshall demonstrating an aggressive ton=
e in rallying their friends behind political causes, in exchanges that are o=
ften self-mocking and sometimes border on being profane.
>=20
> They include rallying cries to, in Mook=E2=80=99s words, =E2=80=9Csmite Re=
publicans mafia-style,=E2=80=9D and, to quote Marshall, =E2=80=9Cpunish thos=
e voters.=E2=80=9D Mook sometimes calls himself =E2=80=9CDeacon=E2=80=9D in t=
he emails, while Marshall, now a senior White House aide, refers to himself a=
s =E2=80=9CReverend=E2=80=9D in many of the exchanges.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CThis is even more exciting than walking through the back of the B=
ellagio.=E2=80=9D
> Their inside jokes sometimes come at the expense of fellow Democrats, incl=
uding former President Bill Clinton. A November 2009 mock news release annou=
ncing the listserv in addition to a new website and an upcoming reunion for t=
he =E2=80=9CMook Mafia=E2=80=9D included a fabricated quote from the former p=
resident.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CThe Mafia has finally built a bridge to the 21st century,=E2=80=9D=
 Bill Clinton is jokingly quoted as having said in an email that appears to h=
ave been written by Marshall. =E2=80=9CThis is even more exciting than walki=
ng through the back of the Bellagio.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> The private emails were provided to ABC News by a Democrat on the listserv=
 who has worked alongside Mook and Marshall on previous campaigns. The perso=
n who provided the emails is, like the vast majority of those on the listser=
v, supportive of Hillary Clinton, but does not support the idea of Mook or M=
arshall holding leadership roles in a second presidential bid. They were pro=
vided on the condition of anonymity.
>=20
> That the emails are emerging publicly reflects the ferocious intra-battle t=
o populate the top positions of an expected Clinton campaign.
>=20
> Neither Mook nor Marshall responded to requests for comment. ABC News firs=
t reached out to both men Thursday morning, by email and phone.
>=20
> "Crushing it mafia style."
> On one level, the listserv is a testament to the loyalty Mook, 34, has ins=
pired over a decade in national politics. His resume includes stints on Howa=
rd Dean=E2=80=99s 2004 campaign, running a series of state efforts for Hilla=
ry Clinton=E2=80=99s 2008 presidential bid and managing Terry McAuliffe=E2=80=
=99s successful run for governor of Virginia last year.
>=20
> Marshall is also a veteran of Clinton=E2=80=99s 2008 campaign. He joined O=
bama=E2=80=99s field operation after the primaries, and he then served in to=
p positions for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, often worki=
ng alongside Mook along the way. He is now a special assistant to the presid=
ent and serves as principal deputy director of the White House Office of Pub=
lic Engagement.
>=20
> The exchanges provide a window into the clubby and pugnacious motivational=
 styles of both Mook and Marshall, two stars of their party=E2=80=99s univer=
se of field organizers and operatives.
>=20
> The two most-recent messages to the group came just last week, on Election=
 Day. They included a reference to a team reunion that would likely be held i=
n New York early next year.
>=20
> At least some recipients saw that reference as presuming that =E2=80=9CMoo=
k Mafia=E2=80=9D members would be involved in running Clinton=E2=80=99s like=
ly presidential candidacy. Clinton represented New York in the Senate and is=
 said to be considering a campaign headquarters in Westchester County.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CTEAM! I was just at the DCCC last night for the GOTV [get-out-the=
-vote] rally, where we were in the middle of GOTV calisthenics when Nancy Pe=
losi walked in and said we looked like the Village People. Some things you c=
an=E2=80=99t make up,=E2=80=9D Mook wrote at 2:59 pm on Election Day.
>=20
> Mook continued: =E2=80=9CThis has been a tough cycle -- midterms always ar=
e -- but what's been so amazing to me is how from the Senate to the House to=
 Governor's races and beyond, we've been keeping the other side on defense. S=
o many of you have played leadershp [sic] roles building field programs, man=
aging campaigns, or running programs from allied groups. It's been incredibl=
y insipiring [sic] to see.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Marshall had written the group earlier that day from Florida, where he was=
 working =E2=80=93 apparently in a volunteer capacity because he still works=
 for the White House -- to elect Charlie Crist as governor.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CI know many of you are out there on campaigns, crushing it mafia s=
tyle,=E2=80=9D Marshall wrote. =E2=80=9CWe unfortunately didn=E2=80=99t do a=
 call this year, but Robby and I wanted to start a chain to acknowledge many=
 in our great family who have been out there busting their tails for all tha=
t is right in the world.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CWe also wanted you to know that this years [sic] reunion will act=
ually be held early next year, January or February, and likely in New York f=
or a weekend. Apologies for the late notice and for not sending anything out=
 on a reunion. Please believe there will be one. The planning committee has j=
ust been a tad busy!=E2=80=9D
>=20
> The email was signed =E2=80=9CMM,=E2=80=9D with Marshall adding a hashtag:=
 #mafia4life.
>=20
> "F U Republicans."
> The existence of a =E2=80=9CMook Mafia=E2=80=9D of friends and loyalists w=
ho extend through Mook=E2=80=99s previous campaign work has long been known.=
 Scattered references to the informal group have appeared in favorable Mook p=
rofiles, and a Politico story last week referenced the possible New York reu=
nion that was mentioned on the listserv.
>=20
> The emails themselves, though, have not been seen publicly before. Much of=
 the email traffic on the listserv appears to have been mundane: announcing j=
ob openings and new assignments, advertising or seeking rooms for rent in ba=
ttleground states and organizing reunions in places including Las Vegas and C=
olumbus, Ohio.
>=20
> In the more substantive messages, though, Marshall emerges as the more agg=
ressive of the duo. Writing in January 2010 to urge fellow =E2=80=9Cmafia=E2=
=80=9D members to work hard on behalf of Massachusetts Senate candidate Mart=
ha Coakley, Marshall offered =E2=80=9Can overall big thank you to everyone o=
n this list who continues to fight the good fight.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> =E2=80=9CF U Republicans. Mafia till I die,=E2=80=9D he wrote. =E2=80=9CIf=
 you have just a few minutes, hop on that activate and punish those voters!=E2=
=80=9D (=E2=80=9CActivate=E2=80=9D is an apparent reference to a software pr=
ogram allowing volunteers to contact targeted voters by phone from anywhere i=
n the country.)
>=20
> "The Mafia never separates."
> The following year, in confirming news that he would be taking a new job t=
hat would include a move to Chicago, Marshall offered special thanks to Mook=
.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CFirst, the mafia never separates, it just continues to grow and e=
xpand and move into other states in order to destroy Republicans,=E2=80=9D h=
e wrote. =E2=80=9CA special thanks to none other than the namesake himself, D=
eacon Robby Mook. Without him, there would be no mafia and I for sure know I=
 would not have learned as much as I have in this business and have this opp=
ortunity.=E2=80=9D
>=20
> Mook responded by announcing =E2=80=9Cmandatory=E2=80=9D attendance at a g=
oodbye party for Marshall at a Capitol Hill bar.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CIt's true: Marlon Marshall is leaving our fold. Today is the day t=
he grownassman [sic] grows up and leaves for America's Second City. I know t=
his prodical [sic] son will return to the mafia manger soon enough to smite R=
epublicans mafia-style,=E2=80=9D Mook wrote.
>=20
> =E2=80=9CIf you can't be here in person, join me in spirit by sending your=
 words of love and encouragement to the Most High Grown Ass Reverend Marlon D=
 as he embarks on his pilgrimage. Please believe and obey the beard.=E2=80=9D=

>=20
> Both Mook and Marshall have been discussed as potential Clinton campaign m=
anagers, should she run for president. Another top contender, Guy Cecil, may=
 have seen his chances damaged by last week=E2=80=99s Republican rout becaus=
e Cecil was running the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for this el=
ection cycle.

<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">On one level, the listserv i=

<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">Marshall is also a veteran o=
f Clinton=E2=80=99s 2008 campaign. He joined Obama=E2=80=99s field operation=
 after the primaries, and he then served in top positions for the Democratic=
 Congressional Campaign Committee, often working
 alongside Mook along the way. He is now a special assistant to the presiden=
t and serves as principal deputy director of the White House Office of Publi=
c Engagement.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">The exchanges provide a win=
dow into the clubby and pugnacious motivational styles of both Mook and Mars=
hall, two stars of their party=E2=80=99s universe of field organizers and op=
eratives.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">The two most-recent message=

<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">=E2=80=9CWe also wanted you=
 to know that this years [sic] reunion will actually be held early next year=

<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">The existence of a =E2=80=9C=
Mook Mafia=E2=80=9D of friends and loyalists who extend through Mook=E2=80=99=
s previous campaign work has long been known. Scattered references to the in=
formal group have appeared in favorable Mook profiles,
 and a Politico story last week referenced the possible New York reunion tha=
t was mentioned on the listserv.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">The emails themselves, thou=
gh, have not been seen publicly before. Much of the email traffic on the lis=
tserv appears to have been mundane: announcing job openings and new assignme=
nts, advertising or seeking rooms
 for rent in battleground states and organizing reunions in places including=
 Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">In the more substantive mes=
sages, though, Marshall emerges as the more aggressive of the duo. Writing i=
n January 2010 to urge fellow =E2=80=9Cmafia=E2=80=9D members to work hard o=
n behalf of Massachusetts Senate candidate Martha
 Coakley, Marshall offered =E2=80=9Can overall big thank you to everyone on t=

<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">The following year, in conf=
irming news that he would be taking a new job that would include a move to C=
hicago, Marshall offered special thanks to Mook.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">=E2=80=9CFirst, the mafia n=

 Mook. Without him, there would be no mafia and I for sure know I would not h=

=80=9D</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">Mook responded by announcin=

 Capitol Hill bar.</p>
<p style=3D"margin: 0px 0px 22px; padding: 0px;">=E2=80=9CIt's true: Marlon M=

 been discussed as potential Clinton campaign managers, should she run for p=
