John --

Here we go again.

House Republicans are actually threatening to bring back their radical =
budget cuts to Medicare. If we don't accept them, they might force a =
government shut down next month.

If this sounds familiar -- it should. This is all a play straight out of =
Paul Ryan's Medicare-destroying budget. His proposed cuts are some of the =
harshest we've ever seen and now House Republicans are back at it: giving =
tax breaks to billionaires and big oil while slashing Medicare and other =
important benefits to seniors.

We only have until September 30th to act or the government could shut =
down. We need to take action right now to stop this nonsense and protect =
Medicare for Illinois seniors.

Click here to automatically sign your name and tell Republicans that =
Illinois refuses to let Congress hold Medicare hostage >>

Republicans, like my opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling - who voted =
FOR Paul Ryan's budget - are more interested in protecting their own =
interests and their backers' deep pockets than seniors and middle class =
families. That's not the kind of leadership we need.

Sign your name now to stand with us in our battle to save Medicare.

Thank you for taking action,
