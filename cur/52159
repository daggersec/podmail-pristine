I agree with you that this is not something President Clinton should do, I
worry, however, that if President Jonathan asks, WJC may say "yes."
Perhaps it would be better to send WJC a memo outlining the request and
explaining why we don't think this is a good idea; so that if President
Jonathan asks, at least WJC will have heard the arguments against.
