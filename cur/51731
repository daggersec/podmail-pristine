*Catholics United Disappointed by Bishop=92s Decision to Withdraw from Civi=
l
Rights Organization
*

*Washington, DC* =96 Catholics United (www.catholics-united.org) executive
director Chris Korzen issued the following statement today in response to
the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' decision to leave the Leadership
Conference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCR). The bishops withdrew their
membership after the well-respected human rights coalition endorsed
President Obama's nomination of Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
decision to leave LCCR comes in response to a pressure campaign by right
wing Catholic groups and individuals, including former Bush Catholic adviso=
r
Deal Hudson.

=93The U.S. Catholic Bishops' withdrawal from LCCR is part of a disturbing
pattern of church leadership kowtowing to conservatives who are opposed to
President Obama and the progressive agenda. Whether they know it or not, th=
e
bishops have become accomplices to the Republican Party and its allies. We
witnessed this with health care reform, and now we see it with the Supreme
Court nomination.=94

=93LCCR endorsed Elena Kagan because of her ability to interpret the
Constitution and uphold our nation's laws. She is widely respected on all
sides of the political spectrum, and as such can transcend the petty
divisiveness that plagues our nation. Knowingly or not, the bishops are
increasingly taking their lead from groups that use church teaching to
further a political agenda.  In doing so, the bishops are contributing to a
coarsening of our nation=92s political environment.  We strongly urge them =
to
reconsider.=94
