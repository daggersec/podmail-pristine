Thanks Marianne. Back to the announcement! Which is where we really do =
need to get back to. Will pass around.=20

Rodney Slater used to always say, =E2=80=9CThe best is yet to =

an initiative.

=20

I think it is a positive message and a simple one that could work for =
Hillary and it=E2=80=99s a message from which many other messages can =
flow.

=20

Our best days are ahead, if we work together.

=20

Our best days are ahead if we harness the power of recent technology =
developments to be put to the greater good.=20

=20

The world has been transformed by the explosion in technology =
development and information set free over the internet in the last 20 =
=E2=80=93 25 years. =20

=20

This transformation has brought about great advances for deploying clean =
energy, communicating with friends and relatives around the world, leap =
frogging economic development and access to education to rural and =
underdeveloped places around the world, improving our understanding of =
health issues (who doesn=E2=80=99t go to a doctor having done their own =
research on the internet about what might be ailing them), etc.=20

=20

But this information revolution has also had some very scary with some =
unforeseen negative consequences and as a result -  those who care about =
the country, world, general public safety and quality of life are always =
trying to stay one step ahead of the bad guys, the hackers, those that =
use the new tools and platforms to spread messages of hate and fear, =
those who want to sometimes destroy that which we value as Americans and =
peaceful global citizens.=20

=20

The potential for a better tomorrow is real.  We just have to work =
together.  We need the brilliant millennials who=E2=80=99ve grown up =
with an instinct about the internet that the babyboomers never had to =
help make this country what they want it to be and this world. =20

=20

We can=E2=80=99t turn back the clock.  We need to make Obamacare better, =
it=E2=80=99s not perfect.  We need more clean energy and ways to deliver =
it.  We can save this planet if we work together. =20

=20

The best days are ahead =E2=80=93 can be ahead =E2=80=93 if everyone =
will join in and work together.  Hillary has a record of working =
together with those that don=E2=80=99t agree with all her positions and =
philosophy =E2=80=93 in the senate and around the world.  =20

=20

I think she needs to tell people =E2=80=93 especially the young people =
who are fearing doom and gloom and don=E2=80=99t want to take it or =
accept it anymore (Bernie=E2=80=99s appeal)=E2=80=93 that there is a =
better future on the horizon =E2=80=93 they just need to join in and =
help us get there.   That college might not be free for everyone but it =
will be affordable.  That the climate issue is real but together we can =
mitigate it and hopefully reverse it.  That wealth and opportunity to =
advance --is not only for just those in the club already. =20

=20

And the people in their 40s and 50s and even early 60s who feel =
they=E2=80=99ve lost ground =E2=80=93 can feel secure that Hillary has =
their, back, concerns and needs in mind as much as she does the children =
and grandchildren.

=20

We can build better bridges, use cleaner energy sources, apply medical =
help fasters, feed larger populations, provide access to education more =
fairly, take care of the elderly and the children, better defend our =
country and explore the oceans and universe  =E2=80=93 we can do it all =
if we work together.  I think that should be Hillary=E2=80=99s message.  =
The best is yet to come for America =E2=80=93 join me in setting the =
country onto that course.  America is already greater than most places =
in the world, but our young country=E2=80=99s best days are still ahead =
of us =E2=80=93 not behind us.  We are building on the success of past =
generations =E2=80=93 not tearing it down.

=20

Positive and encouraging.  We can do this!  We know how.  Hillary knows =
how but needs everyone to join in and work together.   Hillary Will.  =
Our best days are ahead of us, not behind us.  I know it=E2=80=99s not =
new =E2=80=93 but it taps into the American can-do spirit and well, =
it=E2=80=99s simple=E2=80=A6  I love when President Clinton says to his =
New Hampshire crowds, =E2=80=9CWe can do this!=E2=80=9D   Hillary can do =
this! Hillary will.  Our best days are yet to come, if we work together. =
