In Alabama today and just met with state legislators and political folks; I
would not put it on the legislature - essentially the Gov is now saying he
"found" the money but holding it hostage to force black rural democrats to
agree to raise taxes on some of the state's poorest people
So its promise to raise taxes on poor people in order to get your offices
back.

Flagging that Gov. Bentley announced a plan to reopen the 31 offices,
should this be changed to call on him/legislature to do that? Given his new
plan, is the 'excuses' language too strong?
http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/bentley_plan_would_reopen_clos.htm=
l

change  including those in eight of the 10 counties with the highest
percentage of African Americans to:  including  in 8 out of 12 total
majority-minority counties or including in 7 counties where the African
American population is more than two-thirds.

Alabama is one of 17 states with no early voting, would adjust "handful"
language
http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-vot=
ing.aspx

Change Rubio hit to Marco Rubio asked "what's the big deal" about voter id
laws.

Change Kasich hit to: ...a state where 77 percent of early voters in 2008
were African American in the most populated county
