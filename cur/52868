[full disclosure - i'm working on this campaign but thought many of you
would actually be interested so i'm sending it to the list :) ]

wanted to give you a heads about about a great program that that Save the
Children is doing around the first World Pneumonia Day. Over the next few
days they will be launching multiple efforts to increase awareness and
activity around protecting children under the age of five. Pneumonia kills
more children under the age of five than any other disease; it kills more
than AIDS, malaria and measles combined. It would cost only $8 in
antibiotics to save these children.

To launch this campaign Save the Children is doing an audio press conferenc=
e
tomorrow and I wanted to invite you to participate. I pasted the press
advisory below but, they will be talking a bit of background on pneumonia
and the different efforts they are taking to combat it including: working
with members of the House and Senate to pass the Newborn, Child and Mother
Survival Act of 2009 and a petition encouraging members to sign on, a new
website that educates and entertains and some additional information about
celebrity endorsements and actions being taken around the world.

I hope you will be able to make it and let me know if you have any
quesitons.
