Dear John,

In 2009, VoteVets.org founded Vet Voice Foundation, a 501(c)(3)
nonprofit. Yesterday, Vet Voice Foundation released its first
research survey of our 21st Century Veterans. 

Vet Voice Foundation commissioned its first poll of veterans
regarding "Don't Ask, Don't Tell". The non-partisan poll was
conducted by the Democratic polling firm Lake Research Partners
and Republican firm American Viewpoint. The poll's findings are
below. The complete poll can be viewed at

Re: Results From Recent Research among Iraq and Afghanistan
Veterans on Don't Ask, Don't Tell
Date: March 15, 2010
 A recent survey conducted among military personnel who served
in the Afghanistan or Iraq wars shows that by six points Iraq
and Afghanistan veterans under age 35 lean toward favoring
allowing gay and lesbian people to serve openly (41% favor to
35% oppose) while veterans over age 35 lean toward opposing by
five points (31% favor, 36% oppose). This recent bipartisan
survey, conducted among service members in the United States, in
many ways runs counter to the idea being asserted by many, that
service members and the military cannot handle this change and
are unwilling to do so, There is widespread agreement among Iraq
and Afghanistan veterans on three core principles: that veterans
are comfortable around gay and lesbian people, that being gay or
lesbian has no bearing on a service members' ability to perform
their duties, and that, ultimately, these veterans would find it
acceptable if gay and lesbian people were allowed to serve
openly. 

- Iraq and Afghanistan veterans believe being gay or lesbian has
no bearing on a service member's ability to perform their
duties. Overall, 60% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans agree with
that statement, including 42% who strongly agree. Only 29%
disagree. Two-thirds of those veterans under age 35 agree (66%)
with that statement, including almost half (47%) who strongly
agree. Iraq and Afghanistan veterans over age 35 also agree (57%
agree, 40% strongly). Agreement also extends across the branches
of service, including 64% of Air Force veterans, 59% of Army and
Marines veterans, and 58% of Navy veterans. It is clear from a
policy standpoint that Iraq and Afghanistan veterans believe
being gay or lesbian has no bearing on a service member's
ability to perform their duties.

- An overwhelming majority of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans say
it is personally acceptable to them if gay and lesbian people
were allowed to serve openly in the military. Seven in ten (73%)
say it is acceptable, including 42% who say it would be
acceptable and 31% who would find it acceptable even though they
would not like it. Only a quarter (25%) would find it
unacceptable. Generational differences exist here as well, but
they are not as dramatic as conventional wisdom might indicate.
Forty-seven percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans under age
35 find it acceptable and would like the policy change and
another 30% find it acceptable and do not like it, for a total
of 77% who find it personally acceptable if gay and lesbian
people were allowed to serve openly in the military. Seventy
percent of veterans over age 35 would find it acceptable and
only a quarter would find it unacceptable (26%). 

--- In total, 81% of those in the Air Force, 78% of those in the
Navy, 67% of those in the Army, and 68% of those in the Marines
would find it acceptable if gay and lesbian people were allowed
to serve openly in the military. Half of Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans from the Navy (54%), half of those from the Air Force
(50%), and a plurality of those from the Army (37%) find it
acceptable without reservations; and while the Marines are less
accepting without reservation (25%), a plurality would find it
acceptable but would not like it (43%). 

- The notion that today's military members are uncomfortable
around gay and lesbian people is unfounded; the data prove it is
untrue. Iraq and Afghanistan veterans say they are personally
comfortable in the presence of gays and lesbians. Seven in ten
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans (73%) are personally comfortable,
including 37% who are very comfortable. Only a quarter (23%) is
uncomfortable, and hardly anyone is very uncomfortable (only
7%). Notably, younger Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are more
comfortable overall (80%) and show increased intensity around
the issue (41% are very comfortable). Older Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans also express comfort (69% overall, 35% very
comfortable) but even among older veterans, very few are very
uncomfortable in the presence of gay and lesbian people (only
7%). At least seven in ten veterans who served in Iraq of
Afghanistan from across the branches say they are comfortable in
the presence of gays and lesbians: Air Force 78%, Navy 73%, Army
70%, and Marines 69%. 

 As mentioned, younger veterans lean toward favoring allowing
gay men and lesbian women to serve openly while older veterans
lean toward opposing the change, but there is little intensity
in either direction. It is just simply not a burning issue that
overwhelms these veterans' lives. Thirty-four percent of Iraq
and Afghanistan veterans favor allowing openly gay and lesbian
women to serve in the military, 36% oppose it, and another third
(30%) are not sure (28%) or do not know (2%). A quarter is
strongly in favor of allowing gay and lesbian people to serve,
and 29% are strongly opposed. By six points, veterans under age
35 favor open service (41% favor, 35% oppose) including 28% who
strongly favor it; while by a similar five points, veterans over
age 35 oppose it (31% favor, 36% oppose). By twelve points
veterans in the Air Force favor allowing gay and lesbian people
to serve openly, while those in the Navy (+1) and Army (-4)
split. Veterans from the Marines are against it (-17). 

 In summary, an overwhelming majority of Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans are comfortable around gay and lesbian people, believe
that being gay or lesbian has no bearing on a service member's
ability to perform their duties, and would find it acceptable if
gay and lesbian people were allowed to serve openly in the
military. Any notion that ending Don't Ask, Don't Tell would
disrupt the military or that service members would be unwilling
to meet the change is debunked. 

Methods: Lake Research Partners and American Viewpoint designed
and administered this survey, which was conducted by phone using
professional interviewers. The survey reached a total of 510
veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq) and/or Operation
Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan). The survey was conducted
February 8-23, 2010. Telephone numbers for the sample were
generated randomly from a military sample and a radius sample
drawn from military bases in the United States. The margin of
error for the total sample is +/- 4.4 percentage points.
