A Tikkun Throwback:=20
Stopping David Duke and Patrick Buchanan: A Strategy for the 1990s by Micha=
el Lerner
Published in Volume 7, Number 1 in 1992


EDITOR'S NOTE:=20

In some ways, it's understandable that many Americans are still reeling in =
disbelief about the rise of racism, sexism, and xenophobia during this pres=
idential campaign.

Recently, David Duke, who has been a major figure in the Klu Klux Klan, wor=
e a Nazi uniform and spouts anti-Semitic ideas, embraced a leading candidat=
e. Far-right ideology is more prevalent in today's mainstream politics than=
 in the 1990s, and some candidates today, like Duke and presidential candid=
ate Pat Buchanan two decades ago, have tapped into the deep anger and humil=
iation felt by many White Americans.

In the 30th anniversary issue of Tikkun magazine, which subscribers will re=
ceive in late summer of 2016, we are reprinting some of our most enduringly=
 valuable articles from the first decade of our 30 years of existence. I ca=
me across editor Michael Lerner's article on the psychodynamics that underl=
ie the appeal that Duke and Buchanan had 25 years ago and thought "wow, thi=
s was prophetic in its time, and is extremely relevant to understanding the=
 current realities of American politics."

For example, Lerner wrote "the problem is that liberals and progressives ra=
rely understand this issue, rarely ask what legitimate needs are being spok=
en to when the fascists start to gain a mass audience, and hence are often =
unable to develop an effective strategy to prevent the David Dukes and Patr=
ick Buchanans of this world from reaching power."

So instead of waiting to put the article in the magazine for late summer, I=
 thought you might want to read it right now, on the day of major primaries=
 in Ohio and Florida for both Democrats and Republicans - it is amazingly a=
s relevant to this moment as it was when it was first published in Tikkun s=
o many years ago!
=E2=80=93Ari Bloomekatz, Managing Editor, Tikkun Magazine

An important note: Tikkun does not endorse or oppose any candidate running =
for political office.=20

-------=20

It would be silly to imagine that neo-Nazism or fascism is about to sweep t=
hrough the U.S. in the 1990s. But the candidacies of David Duke and Patrick=
 Buchanan for the Republican presidential nomination are likely to give new=
 publicity and respectability to only barely disguised racist, anti-Semitic=
, and xenophobic ideas in American politics. Right-wing extremists are crea=
ting a poisonous tendency in American political discourse, as they seek to =
establish a pseudo-community among the white middle class by mobilizing ang=
er against the poor, the homeless, welfare recipients, immigrants, Blacks, =
gays, Jews, or the Japanese, and by rallying around talk about "America fir=
st" (the slogan of the pro-Nazi isolationists in the 1930s). The social con=
ditions that allowed David Duke to capture 55 percent of Louisiana's white =
vote are likely to be more rather than less prevalent in the US. over the n=
ext generation, and the type of politics Duke and Buchanan represent will l=
ikely command a large audience nationwide. So this article is not particula=
rly concerned with this year's election-we think it unlikely that either Du=
ke or Buchanan will win the nomination-but with the social movements that t=
hey will be mobilizing in the years ahead.=20

The Dukes and Buchanans get some of their support from hard-core right-wing=
ers, racists, and fascists whose character structures and ideological commi=
tments attract them to racism, hatred, and violence. But to move beyond the=
ir hard core to the much larger constituency that voted forDuke or that is =
listening to Buchanan, the ultrarightists have learned how to appeal to man=
y decent Americans by speaking to real and legitimate needs, to acknowledge=
 the pain in their lives, and to give them the sense that they are being re=
cognized and respected. Because our goal is to find ways to dislodge this s=
ector of the population from the Right, we need to understand what these le=
gitimate needs are and to speak to them in a way that separates the legitim=
ate recognition of their pain from the illegitimate expression of that pain=
 in racist or xenophobic directions.=20

The problem is that liberals and progressives rarely understand this issue,=
 rarely ask what legitimate needs are being spoken to when the fascists sta=
rt to gain a mass audience, and hence are often unable to develop an effect=
ive strategy to prevent the David Dukes and Patrick Buchanans of this world=
 from reaching power. Similarly, if we turn to the way that most people hav=
e been taught to think about the triumph of fascism in Europe in the 1920s =
and 1930s, we find that few of the analyses of this critical episode in his=
tory provide us with serious answers to the question we are raising.=20

Instead, conventional answers to this question tended to fit the agendas of=
 those seeking to justify various post-World War II political alignments. W=
estern countries were anxious to rehabilitate former Nazis and to gain popu=
lar support in Germany. A West German state, they reasoned, could face down=
 the ideological appeal of communism and withstand the potential military t=
hreat of the Red Army. But to secure German loyalty, Nazism could not be po=
rtrayed as arising out of something deep and abiding in the situation of th=
e German people or its culture. Instead, it became popular in the West to a=
bsolve most Germans of any responsibility for what had happened by thinking=
 of Nazism as some kind of collective that had magically descended on the G=
erman people in 1933, and magically disappeared in 1945. This consciousness=
 reached its fullest expression in President Reagan's visit to the Bitburg =
cemetery in which former SS officers were buried along with other former so=
ldiers of the Nazi army, and in the West's celebration of the reunification=
 of Germany. We need only witness neo-Nazi skinhead attacks on immigrants t=
o see how premature this reunification really was.=20

Soviet explanations of the Holocaust, meanwhile, were equally tailored to t=
he Soviets' need to mobilize the East German population into the cold war. =
What caused Nazism, the communists argued, was capitalist imperialism itsel=
f. The industrialists, preoccupied with the imminent threat of communist ru=
le as the worldwide depression deepened, used the Nazis to keep the workers=
 in line. In the version popularized by Bertolt Brecht in his play "The Rem=
arkable Rise of Arturo Ui" the industrialists hired a gangster, but the gan=
gster eventually turned on his employers and took on a life of his own, bec=
oming in the process something far more ugly and sinister than the hired th=
ug he was at the play's outset. The solution, then, was simple: Eliminate t=
he gangsters first; then uproot the capitalist system that had created them=
. The Soviets went even further than the West in ignoring the complicity of=
 the German population in all this. Soviet propagandists were desperate to =
recruit a German population that had long been warned of the horrors of Sov=
iet rule-and that had shown a great deal of enthusiasm for the Nazis.=20

Both of these accounts were remarkably superficial. Both denied the importa=
nt role of anti-Semitism and of the deep needs that Nazi ideology was able =
to exploit. And both conscientiously avoided dealing with the growing numbe=
rs of Germans who voluntarily and eagerly joined the Nazi party in the late=
 19205 and early 19305, and who formed an electoral majority for the Nazis =
in 1932.=20

Unlike these cold war interpretations, the typical Zionist account had the =
advantage of acknowledging the popular support for fascism in Germany, even=
 though it then conjured up another magical concept: the supposed inevitabi=
lity of gentile hatred of the Jews. Zionists quite correctly drew upon the =
long history of anti-Semitism in the West to show that Nazism was not an ab=
erration, solely the product of its social background or historical moment.=
 Rather, it was a full expression of the Jew-hating in which Western politi=
cs and culture had been steeped for centuries.=20

But many Zionists tended to essentialize anti-Semitism as a permanent fact =
in the consciousness of the goyim. Jews could deal with this ugly fact eith=
er by making clever deals with ruling elites who might control and suppress=
 it among the masses, or by assuming that it might reemerge at any moment, =
leaving nothing to be done but secure a strong military for the Jewish Stat=
e. By essentializing anti-Semitism as the perennial irrational hatred of Je=
ws, the Zionists avoided the question of what could be done to combat its r=
ise. Rather, the only relevant question became: What do we do to give stren=
gth to the State of Israel, a place to which the victims can escape?=20

If escape is one extreme, based on a pessimistic assessment of the fundamen=
tal stupidity or evil of those attracted to the Right, the other extreme wa=
s taken up in the twenties and thirties by the communist Left in Germany. T=
he CP correctly noted that German capital- ism required imperialism. Since =
the world's markets were already dominated by the U.S., England, and France=
, German capitalists had only two choices: either allow the current depress=
ion to continue, with the inevitable radicalization of the population in wa=
ys that might lead to socialist revolution; or resist the ruinous program o=
f reparations and trade restrictions the victorious powers imposed on Germa=
ny after World War I, in which case an aggressive German nationalism would =
have to be re, stored to its former prestige. The CP concluded that since t=
he aggressive nationalism was the inevitable outcome of capitalist rule, th=
e only solution was to preach immediate revolution. And since Germany's lar=
ge Social Democratic party did not favor such a revolution, the Social Demo=
crats, and not the Nazis, were deemed the real enemy: In blocking a revolut=
ion they were condemning Germany to a capitalist regime that would necessar=
ily lead the country into fascism.=20

However, both the Social Democrats and the Communists failed to understand =
that Hitler was growing in popularity not only because of Germany's despera=
te economic situation, but also because he spoke to a set of "other" needs =
that the socialists could not begin to understand. After all, if it were so=
lely economic issues that motivated Hitler's supporters, the Communist prog=
ram had as much to offer as the fascist one did. In fact, the fascists put =
themselves forward as national socialists-that is, as a force that, like th=
e Left, would combat the power of the capitalist class. Once they took powe=
r and consolidated their hold on government and society, the Nazis also bec=
ame reconciled with Germany's industrialists. Nonetheless, the Nazis drew s=
ome of their mass appeal from their image as enemies of Germany's business =
elite.=20

But the fascists added to the economic picture an understanding of the deep=
 humiliation and sense of powerlessness that most people were feeling as th=
ey faced the unemployment and inflation of the post-World War I years. Thes=
e economic humiliations were coupled with a deep spiritual and ethical cris=
is that characterized German society under the Weimar Republic. The values =
of the feudal past had collapsed rapidly, but what seemed to be replacing t=
hem was an ethos of extreme self-interest, profligate sexuality, moral rela=
tivism, and family collapse. The older communities that formerly gave moori=
ng and direction to life were rapidly disintegrating, or perceived themselv=
es to be under un- relenting attack. To be sure, some of the resistance to =
the cultural revolution of the 1920s was based on a reactionary longing for=
 a past that was oppressive to most or for the security that patriarchy off=
ered. But not all of this resistance was simply reactionary. Some of it was=
 based on a correct assessment that the new society emerging in Germany was=
 oppressive in a different way. Those who still felt some allegiance to pre=
capitalist values sensed that Weimar society provided little opportunity fo=
r many people to feel good about themselves, or to feel confident that what=
 they bad managed to achieve for themselves in their work, family life, and=
 community was likely to survive the winds of change.=20

In these circumstances, the fascist Right has developed a formula that wins=
 it considerable mass appeal, and that, under some conditions, allows it to=
 gain power. First, it validates these concerns. Second, it proposes that p=
eople can overcome the alienation they experience in daily life by becoming=
 part of a fantasized community-the powerful Nation. But in fact, the exper=
ience of being part of the Nation doesn't work for very long, because after=
 the parades and the song-fests and spectacles, people return to the aliena=
ting workplaces and oppressive family relations that shape their daily live=
s. The Nation, in other words, is a fantasized community-provided as an "al=
ternative" to changing the oppressive institutions of daily life. So, when =
people's pain and alienation returns, we go to part three of the fascist pr=
ogram: the identification of an Enemy, who has somehow insinuated itself in=
to the daily life of the nation and undermined the experience of solidarity=
 and mutual caring that supposedly would have been there otherwise. This En=
emy is typically the Jew or the Communist, but also, in the case of David D=
uke's American brand of protofascism, the Blacks (now carefully identified =
in speeches with such coded references as "welfare cheats" or "beneficiarie=
s of wasteful government pro- grams"). Whichever identity this Enemy assume=
s, it must be rooted out if the people of the nation are to achieve the hum=
an satisfactions and community that they seek.=20

An intelligent Left in Germany would have started by acknowledging that the=
 experiences of pain and powerlessness and under-confirmation of people's b=
eing was real. And instead of simply talking about economic solutions and p=
olitical revolution, leaders of this Left would have tried to create progra=
ms that immediately spoke to the pain, frustration, alienation, and under-c=
onfirmation that people were experiencing.=20

George Mosse, the renowned historian of fascism, suggests in his book Masse=
s and Man (Wayne State University Press, 1987) that the Left may also need =
to consider ways to develop a progressive and humane nationalism. Certainly=
 one might argue that progressive forces could have legitimately affirmed s=
ome elements of German national culture. Certainly the communist internatio=
nalism that the Left envisioned as the only alternative to German nationali=
sm was itself already dominated by Stalinist totalitarianism and thus prese=
nted, at best, a dubious substitute for a progressive version of a usable G=
erman past.=20

But this analysis raises a host of more basic, theoretical questions. What,=
 first of all, would a progressive nationalism look like? It would, of cour=
se, have to move beyond the fantasy nature of reactionary nationalisms. By =
validating the humane, life-affirming, and morally sensitive aspects of the=
 tradition and culture in which it is rooted, it would also directly challe=
nge racist and national chauvinist accounts of the pain and powerlesness in=
 people's lives by providing alternative explanations. Progressive national=
ists would identify the current structures of the competitive marketplace a=
nd of patriarchal society most responsible for making daily life unfulfilli=
ng and alienating.=20

There are real risks in identifying with "any" nationalism-and you can see =
grim testimony to those risks in the other pieces in this special section o=
f the magazine. Thus we might consider addressing some of the same concerns=
 in another form. For example, I've suggested that the American Left adopt =
a progressive profamily program that would substantially address the same i=
ssues of alienation, powerlessness, and self-blame that a progressive natio=
nalism would seek to address-and yet avoid some of the problematic features=
 of nationalism (though I acknowledge that much of my argument could also b=
e used to support an attempt to develop a progressive appropriation of nati=
onal symbols of history). Once again, we start by acknowledging that people=
 are correct to feel that there is a real problem in family life and that p=
eople's desire for long-term loving and committed relationships is a legiti=
mate desire. We then try to separate these legitimate concerns from the rea=
ctionary elements of family life that the Right has appealed to-the oppress=
ive patriarchal order, the insistence on only one "correct" form of family =
life, the attempt to stigmatize gays and feminists.=20

A progressive profamily program would include gay families and single-paren=
t families. And rather than idealize the pathologies that afflict many exis=
ting families, it would acknowledge the pain and stress that often distorts=
 family life, and would then help people understand this pain as part of a =
larger set of competitive, market-dominated social relations. People are re=
warded in the marketplace precisely because they succeed in manipulating an=
d controlling others. Yet these very qualities, embodied in the "smooth ope=
rators" and "cool people" who "make it" in the competitive marketplace crea=
te narcissistic personalities: precisely the character types that are unabl=
e to make long-term loving commitments in family life, or even in friendshi=
ps. Even when they genuinely wish to achieve intimacy, they don't know how =
to stop manipulating and attempting to control the very people they wish to=
 have as lovers or friends. And the stress that people experience in the wo=
rld of work-a direct function of the way that work gives people little oppo=
rtunity to fulfill their capacities for creativity, intelligence, cooperati=
on, and self-determination-is brought home into family life. There it often=
 erupts in irritability, depression, insensitivity, or a general lack of en=
ergy and awareness, each of which works to undermine loving relationships. =
This is just one realm-albeit an extremely important one-in which the Left =
could develop what I call a politics of meaning. This isn't a question mere=
ly of providing a set of economic benefits to families or to provide family=
 rights (though I think we should "also" develop a Bill of Rights for worke=
rs and for families). Rather, it's a question of helping people understand =
why it's so hard to build loving relationships, acknowledging their pain, h=
elping them to stop blaming themselves, and allowing them to see that some =
personal problems are rooted in societal pathologies. Once the Left begins =
to address the pains of daily life, it can provide many deeper and ultimate=
ly more fulfilling ways for people to understand what is actually bothering=
 them.=20

The exact way the Left might have applied this kind of thinking to the Euro=
pe of the late twenties and early thirties might be debated. But what I hav=
e been arguing is that this whole way of thinking-this entire confrontation=
 with the question of what was hurting people's daily lives and how that pa=
in was transformed into rage at "the Other"-was absent and as a result, the=
 Left had no plausible way to fight the ascent of fascism.=20

That same error has emerged in the Left's response to the growth of the rad=
ical Right in the seventies and eighties in the U.S., and to the growth of =
Duke-style fascism in the nineties. If current trends continue, many of thi=
s country's leading industrial corporations will move manufacturing jobs ou=
t of the US. The huge debts generated by the reckless military Spending of =
the Reagan and Bush years will thwart the development of an economic and ed=
ucational infrastructure that could give the U.S. a competitive advantage i=
n the emerging scientific and technological revolutions in production. As a=
 result, the standing of the U.S. in the international capitalist market wi=
ll continue to slip. Growing unemployment and inflation will produce a sens=
e of general despair about the future. One plausible Left response to such =
conditions would be to push for a worldwide system of rational planning-bot=
h to deal with the ecological crisis that threatens to destroy the entire w=
orld, and to prevent a new clash between rival nationalisms. A progressive =
approach to international planning would require both a refined ecological =
sensitivity and a fair allocation of the world's resources and productive c=
apacities, advantaging countries equally, taking into account the needs of =
the Third World as well as of the advanced industrial societies. Without su=
ch an international plan, we are likely to face a twenty-first century plag=
ued by ecological disasters and competing economic nationalisms. And it is =
not unthinkable that the U.S., unable to rely on its waning superiority in =
science, engineering, and productive technology, would be tempted to turn t=
o the one arena where it "has" committed its resources: military superiorit=
y. Justifying a new aggressive nationalism would require some kind of popul=
ar movement-and here the Duke-type forces, perhaps shielded by the Republic=
an party's right wing, would play an important role.=20

An alternative economic solution that required international planning and r=
ational use of the world's resources would benefit everyone, and might save=
 the world from ecological disaster. But such a solution will be impossible=
 to implement as long as the U.S. government is dominated by a corporate el=
ite more interested in its own freedom to maximize profits than in the long=
-term well-being of the society as a whole. For some corporate leaders, the=
 possibility of moving their capital to more productive countries is an ade=
quate solution; for others, the possibility of using American military powe=
r to back their corporate interests provides the necessary insurance. But f=
ew corporate leaders are willing to use America's current strength to push =
the other capitalist countries into any plan of long-term cooperation.=20

If we want the U.S. government to use its power to help mold an internation=
al plan, we need to found a popular social movement to challenge the entren=
ched powers that serve the interests of the corporations. The promise of th=
is kind of movement has always been what lies behind the appeal of the popu=
lists, those who tried to articulate popular resentments against the entren=
ched interests.=20

Our task in the U.S. is to create a populism that does not appeal to the ra=
cism, sexism, and national chauvinism that have disfigured right-wing and f=
ascistic forms of populism. To do this, we need to address the "crisis" "in=
 meaning": the forces that cause people to feel alienated, devoid of meanin=
g and purpose, lacking in community, and unrecognized. Listening to some of=
 the in-depth interviews that Were done with people who voted for David Duk=
e in 1991, we hear over and over again variations of one theme: "I am here,=
 I count, and David Duke made me feel that he was the only one who noticed =
that." Underlying this assertion is the pain of people who feel that their =
cares and concerns are receiving little validation or attention.=20

Of course, liberals, progressives, and many of the community-relations prof=
essionals of the Jewish world respond to this critique by saying something =
like this: "Sure, there is underlying pain, but that pain is deeply embedde=
d in racism and anti-Semitism, and we can't make any compromises with those=
 kinds of feelings." But this misses the point. To validate the pain is "no=
t" to validate the racism, but to try instead to drive a wedge between the =
legitimate pains and illegitimate racist and fascist solutions, precisely i=
n order to "defeat" racism and anti-Semitism.=20

The liberal and progressive responses typically lead to one of two strategi=
es: eliminate the economic problems and we will eliminate the potential for=
 fascism; or outlaw racism and coerce those who practice it with economic o=
r political pressure. But both strategies are unlikely to work. America's e=
conomic problems cannot be solved in the long run unless we talk about limi=
ting the freedom of the marketplace and creating real international coopera=
tion and planning. Yet at the same time, liberal Democrats and corporate le=
aders will be represented prominently in any antifascist coalition. They wi=
ll totally oppose this direction, and can be expected to use their consider=
able power to prevent anyone from making it part of the antifascist strateg=
y. So instead we will be treated to a variety of stop-gap economic spending=
 programs that may temporarily reduce unemployment, but will not work to re=
verse the larger trend of American economic decline. And ironically, conser=
vatives will cite the failure of these measures as further proof that any g=
overnmental program will necessarily fail, and hence convince people that w=
hat we need is less planning rather than more.=20

On the other hand, the second set of liberal remedies-legal constraints to =
punish racist and discriminatory practices-won't work. We live in a democra=
cy; and the more racist ideas are able to win popular support, the more we =
will have right-wing judges and legislators dismantling the programs that h=
ad served previously as constraints on both racism and fascism.=20

Given this dead end in traditional liberal politics, there's no real altern=
ative but to win popular support for a progressive populist program. To do =
so, progressive populism must go far beyond visionary plans for an internat=
ional planned economy, and directly address the pain of daily life. A progr=
essive profamily program, a progressive approach to the world of work, and =
a progressive nationalism may all be elements in such a populism. And a ser=
ious antifascist program must show people that we care about their lives, n=
ot just that we believe in some abstract sense in their "rights" or "equal =
opportunity." We must speak concretely to what is actually happening in the=
ir family lives, and to the sense of loss that afflicts the communities the=
y inhabit. We will be successful when we can help people understand the pai=
n they experience in their daily lives. This pain takes many forms: the sen=
se of abandonment the elderly feel when they are denied respect, caring, an=
d gratitude from their children or when they sense their children have reje=
cted wholesome values and have become selfish and insensitive. Or it surfac=
es again in the feelings that haunt many of our personal relations: the sen=
se that we have fewer friendships that we can count on, or that our marriag=
es and families are likely to collapse. Or it could be the painful realizat=
ion that work has proved to be a "dead end" and feels dull and alienating. =
We must begin to acknowledge the central importance of all these pains in o=
ur political life. And we must clearly convey that we understand and care a=
bout such pain, and have ideas about how it can be alleviated.=20

Ultimately, the struggle against fascism is a struggle for the minds and he=
arts of the American people. To win, we need to acknowledge that the moral =
relativism and spiritual deadness of the contemporary world is indeed somet=
hing that needs to be fought-and that these ills are products of the reduct=
ionist logic of capitalist materialism. Similarly, we must work to create t=
housands of consciousness-raising groups in workplaces and communities that=
 will encourage people to understand their personal pain in its full social=
 context. The Left must also redesign and adopt the technologies of individ=
ual transformation, so well utilized both by the twelve-step programs of th=
e therapeutic recovery movement, and by many organizations on the Right to =
empower and mobilize people to a different kind of politics. The Left can a=
lso appropriate national symbols and national mythology in public events th=
at reflect a progressive program of social change. Imagine, for example, pu=
blic events in every community in the U.S. to celebrate the Bill of Rights,=
 and to encourage communities to develop their conceptions of a fuller sens=
e of human rights applicable to the twenty-first century. In the 1980s, we =
at the Institute for Labor and Mental Health developed a Family Day for the=
 city of Oakland, which thousands of people attended. Imagine a similar yea=
rly event in every major U.S. city aimed at helping people recognize that m=
any of the problems they face in family life are actually rooted in larger =
social ills that a progressive program was designed to change.=20

These consciousness-raising aspects of a politics of meaning would find con=
crete applications in a set of programs aimed at reshaping our society so t=
hat daily life would enhance our abilities to be loving, creative, and cari=
ng human beings. These changes would include democratization of the world o=
f work, a government re- structured to emphasize person-to-person caring ac=
tivities over the workings of an impersonal bureaucracy, and schools that t=
each values and nurture spiritual and ethical sensitivities. The economy, m=
eanwhile, should be restructured toward cooperative and caring behavior. Th=
at such a society would be more likely to be productive and competitive in =
the international market of the twenty-first century is an important by-pro=
duct, but not the major goal, of a transformative and compassionate politic=
s of meaning. And a progressive politics that showed this kind of caring fo=
r the American people would "win". The Left could then be in a position to =
push for international economic planning that could reverse the steady decl=
ine of the economic wellbeing into the next century. Unlike the right-wing =
and fascist programs that can only provide a fantasized community, the demo=
cratic restructuring that our program calls for would actually create a les=
s alienated and more fulfilling daily life. Yet only our willingness to rec=
ognize people's pain, and to help them overcome self-blaming, could possibl=
y put us in a position where we would have the power to restructure the soc=
iety in a humane way.=20

Call this approach a mass of compassion. But it is "not" the liberal compas=
sion that merely doles out to the most economically oppressed a set of econ=
omic entitlements. On the contrary, this kind of compassion starts from a r=
ecognition that the same kind of pain that afflicts those attracted to the =
Right also afflicts the rest of us. Indeed, those on the Left are often in =
as much trouble and pain as those on the Right. Liberals and progressives h=
ave developed their own ways of dealing with that pain, e.g. psychotherapy,=
 recreational drugs, sexual "acting out." Such solutions may be, on the who=
le, less socially destructive than the fascist counterparts that emerge on =
the Right, but the fact is that we are "not" on a different planet or in a =
different universe than those who ended up voting for David Duke. Recognizi=
ng this fact would be the first step toward a politics of compassion: If we=
 could allow ourselves to really understand this, we would not project the =
elitist image that so infuriates the people whom we allegedly wish to reach=
. Yet this may be the hardest point of all for liberals and leftists to acc=
ept: They are so addicted to their sense of moral superiority that they oft=
en prefer it to political victory. Yet in fighting the potential fascisms o=
f the coming decades, we cannot afford this self-indulgence. Morality yes, =
superiority no. The best way to avoid this temptation is to confront our ow=
n lives deeply, acknowledge our own pain, frustration, and vulnerability, a=
nd begin to understand the ways that these feelings are similar to the pain=
s of many who describe their experiences in right-wing language.=20

A united front against fascism, then, must be based on a real alternative t=
o fascism-not just an analysis of why fascism is bad or what it has led to =
in the past, but a substantive view of how to reorder our society in ways t=
hat relieve the pain that leads people to embrace fascism in the first plac=
e. It was not inevitable that the fascists would win in 1928 in Europe. The=
ir ascent could have been blocked, had people developed a compassionate str=
ategy that addressed the kinds of concerns I've outlined here. And while th=
e Dukes of the world are inevitably going to be part of the political disco=
urse of the 1990s, their victories are by no means inevitable. Establishmen=
t rightists such as Bush will not be able to fight off the threat of a resu=
rgent domestic fascism, since they appeal to the same dynamics but only dra=
w the line at more external enemies. That's why it's not unfair to link Bus=
h and Duke-the entire American Right uses the same basic strategy that has =
paved the way for the legitimation of a fascist and anti-Semitic character =
like David Duke. And liberals and progressives who refuse to take seriously=
 the psychological and spiritual crisis of contemporary society will prove =
no more effective in the antifascist struggle. They will hold assemblies, p=
erhaps mobilize mass demonstrations, certainly sign petitions. But they won=
't look at the pain, anger, and frustration that this society has engendere=
d-because doing this would force them to ask questions about the need for a=
 radical restructuring and to see how much they have in common with the peo=
ple they love to disdain-the people who are drawn to racist, anti-Semitic, =
and aggressive nationalist ideologies. It is urgent, then, for a united fro=
nt against fascism to concentrate on a politics of meaning and a mass of co=
mpassion in order to resist the destructive possibilities of the coming dec=
ades.

andidates today, like Duke and presidential candidate Pat Buchanan two deca=
des ago, have tapped into the deep anger and humiliation felt by many White=
 Americans.</span><br />

                                            In the 30th anniversary issue o=
f&#160;<em style=3D"line-height: 1.22em;">Tikkun</em>&#160;magazine, which =
subscribers will receive in late summer of 2016, we are reprinting some of =
our most enduringly valuable articles from the first decade of our 30 years=
 of existence. I came across editor Michael Lerner&rsquo;s article on the p=
sychodynamics that underlie the appeal that Duke and Buchanan had 25 years =
ago and thought &ldquo;wow, this was prophetic in its time, and is extremel=
y relevant to understanding the current realities of American politics.&rdq=
uo;</span><br />
                                            <span style=3D"font-family: Ari=
al;"><br />
                                            For example, Lerner wrote &ldqu=
o;the problem is that liberals and progressives rarely understand this issu=
e, rarely ask what legitimate needs are being spoken to when the fascists s=
tart to gain a mass audience, and hence are often unable to develop an effe=
ctive strategy to prevent the David Dukes and Patrick Buchanans of this wor=
ld from reaching power.&rdquo;</span><br />
                                            <span style=3D"font-family: Ari=
al;"><br />
                                            So instead of waiting to put th=
e article in the magazine for late summer, I thought you might want to read=
 it right now, on the day of major primaries in Ohio and Florida for both D=
emocrats and Republicans &mdash; it is amazingly as relevant to this moment=
 as it was when it was first published in&#160;<em style=3D"line-height: 1.=

fascism is about to sweep through the U.S. in the 1990s. But the candidacie=
s of&#160;David&#160;Duke&#160;and Patrick Buchanan for the Republican pres=
idential nomination are likely to give new publicity and respectability to =
only barely disguised racist, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic ideas in America=
n politics. Right-wing extremists are creating a poisonous tendency in Amer=
ican political discourse, as they seek to establish a pseudo-community amon=
g the white middle class by mobilizing anger against the poor, the homeless=
, welfare recipients, immigrants, Blacks, gays, Jews, or the Japanese, and =
by rallying around talk about &ldquo;America first&rdquo; (the slogan of th=
e pro-Nazi isolationists in the 1930s). The social conditions that allowed&=
#160;David&#160;Duke&#160;to capture 55 percent of Louisiana&rsquo;s white =
vote are likely to be more rather than less prevalent in the US. over the n=
ext generation, and the type of politics&#160;Duke&#160;and Buchanan repres=
ent will likely command a large audience nationwide. So this article is not=
 particularly concerned with this year&rsquo;s election&mdash;we think it u=
nlikely that either&#160;Duke&#160;or Buchanan will win the nomination&mdas=
h;but with the social movements that they will be mobilizing in the years a=

kes and Buchanans get some of their support from hard-core right-wingers, r=
acists, and fascists whose character structures and ideological commitments=
 attract them to racism, hatred, and violence. But to move beyond their har=
d core to the much larger constituency that voted forDuke&#160;or that is l=
istening to Buchanan, the ultrarightists have learned how to appeal to many=
 decent Americans by speaking to real and legitimate needs, to acknowledge =
the pain in their lives, and to give them the sense that they are being rec=
ognized and respected. Because our goal is to find ways to dislodge this se=
ctor of the population from the Right, we need to understand what these leg=
itimate needs are and to speak to them in a way that separates the legitima=
te recognition of their pain from the illegitimate expression of that pain =
in racist or xenophobic directions.</span></p>

oblem is that liberals and progressives rarely understand this issue, rarel=
y ask what legitimate needs are being spoken to when the fascists start to =
gain a mass audience, and hence are often unable to develop an effective st=
rategy to prevent the&#160;David&#160;Dukes and Patrick Buchanans of this w=
orld from reaching power. Similarly, if we turn to the way that most people=
 have been taught to think about the triumph of fascism in Europe in the 19=
20s and 1930s, we find that few of the analyses of this critical episode in=
 history provide us with serious answers to the question we are raising.</s=

d, conventional answers to this question tended to fit the agendas of those=
 seeking to justify various post-World War II political alignments. Western=
 countries were anxious to rehabilitate former Nazis and to gain popular su=
pport in Germany. A West German state, they reasoned, could face down the i=
deological appeal of communism and withstand the potential military threat =
of the Red Army. But to secure German loyalty, Nazism could not be portraye=
d as arising out of something deep and abiding in the situation of the Germ=
an people or its culture. Instead, it became popular in the West to absolve=
 most Germans of any responsibility for what had happened by thinking of Na=
zism as some kind of collective that had magically descended on the German =
people in 1933, and magically disappeared in 1945. This consciousness reach=
ed its fullest expression in President Reagan&rsquo;s visit to the Bitburg =
cemetery in which former SS officers were buried along with other former so=
ldiers of the Nazi army, and in the West&rsquo;s celebration of the reunifi=
cation of Germany. We need only witness neo-Nazi skinhead attacks on immigr=
ants to see how premature this reunification really was.</span></p>

 explanations of the Holocaust, meanwhile, were equally tailored to the Sov=
iets&rsquo; need to mobilize the East German population into the cold war. =
What caused Nazism, the communists argued, was capitalist imperialism itsel=
f. The industrialists, preoccupied with the imminent threat of communist ru=
le as the worldwide depression deepened, used the Nazis to keep the workers=
 in line. In the version popularized by Bertolt Brecht in his play&#160;<i>=
The Remarkable Rise of Arturo Ui</i>&#160;the industrialists hired a gangst=
er, but the gangster eventually turned on his employers and took on a life =
of his own, becoming in the process something far more ugly and sinister th=
an the hired thug he was at the play&rsquo;s outset. The solution, then, wa=
s simple: Eliminate the gangsters first; then uproot the capitalist system =
that had created them. The Soviets went even further than the West in ignor=
ing the complicity of the German population in all this. Soviet propagandis=
ts were desperate to recruit a German population that had long been warned =
of the horrors of Soviet rule&mdash;and that had shown a great deal of enth=
usiasm for the Nazis.</span></p>

f these accounts were remarkably superficial. Both denied the important rol=
e of anti-Semitism and of the deep needs that Nazi ideology was able to exp=
loit. And both conscientiously avoided dealing with the growing numbers of =
Germans who voluntarily and eagerly joined the Nazi party in the late 19205=
 and early 19305, and who formed an electoral majority for the Nazis in 193=
2.</span></p>

 these cold war interpretations, the typical Zionist account had the advant=
age of acknowledging the popular support for fascism in Germany, even thoug=
h it then conjured up another magical concept: the supposed inevitability o=
f gentile hatred of the Jews. Zionists quite correctly drew upon the long h=
istory of anti-Semitism in the West to show that Nazism was not an aberrati=
on, solely the product of its social background or historical moment. Rathe=
r, it was a full expression of the Jew-hating in which Western politics and=
 culture had been steeped for centuries.</span></p>

t;background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;Times New Roman">But ma=
ny Zionists tended to essentialize anti-Semitism as a permanent fact in the=
 consciousness of the goyim. Jews could deal with this ugly fact either by =
making clever deals with ruling elites who might control and suppress it am=
ong the masses, or by assuming that it might reemerge at any moment, leavin=
g nothing to be done but secure a strong military for the Jewish State. By =
essentializing anti-Semitism as the perennial irrational hatred of Jews, th=
e Zionists avoided the question of what could be done to combat its rise. R=
ather, the only relevant question became: What do we do to give strength to=
 the State of Israel, a place to which the victims can escape?</span></p>

ape is one extreme, based on a pessimistic assessment of the fundamental st=
upidity or evil of those attracted to the Right, the other extreme was take=
n up in the twenties and thirties by the communist Left in Germany. The CP =
correctly noted that German capital- ism required imperialism. Since the wo=
rld&rsquo;s markets were already dominated by the U.S., England, and France=
, German capitalists had only two choices: either allow the current depress=
ion to continue, with the inevitable radicalization of the population in wa=
ys that might lead to socialist revolution; or resist the ruinous program o=
f reparations and trade restrictions the victorious powers imposed on Germa=
ny after World War I, in which case an aggressive German nationalism would =
have to be re, stored to its former prestige. The CP concluded that since t=
he aggressive nationalism was the inevitable outcome of capitalist rule, th=
e only solution was to preach immediate revolution. And since Germany&rsquo=
;s large Social Democratic party did not favor such a revolution, the Socia=
l Democrats, and not the Nazis, were deemed the real enemy: In blocking a r=
evolution they were condemning Germany to a capitalist regime that would ne=
cessarily lead the country into fascism.</span></p>

t;background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;Times New Roman">Howeve=
r, both the Social Democrats and the Communists failed to understand that H=
itler was growing in popularity not only because of Germany&rsquo;s despera=
te economic situation, but also because he spoke to a set of&#160;<i>other<=
/i>&#160;needs that the socialists could not begin to understand. After all=
, if it were solely economic issues that motivated Hitler&rsquo;s supporter=
s, the Communist program had as much to offer as the fascist one did. In fa=
ct, the fascists put themselves forward as national socialists&mdash;that i=
s, as a force that, like the Left, would combat the power of the capitalist=
 class. Once they took power and consolidated their hold on government and =
society, the Nazis also became reconciled with Germany&rsquo;s industrialis=
ts. Nonetheless, the Nazis drew some of their mass appeal from their image =
as enemies of Germany&rsquo;s business elite.</span></p>

t;background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;Times New Roman">But th=
e fascists added to the economic picture an understanding of the deep humil=
iation and sense of powerlessness that most people were feeling as they fac=
ed the unemployment and inflation of the post-World War I years. These econ=
omic humiliations were coupled with a deep spiritual and ethical crisis tha=
t characterized German society under the Weimar Republic. The values of the=
 feudal past had collapsed rapidly, but what seemed to be replacing them wa=
s an ethos of extreme self-interest, profligate sexuality, moral relativism=
, and family collapse. The older communities that formerly gave mooring and=
 direction to life were rapidly disintegrating, or perceived themselves to =
be under un- relenting attack. To be sure, some of the resistance to the cu=
ltural revolution of the 1920s was based on a reactionary longing for a pas=
t that was oppressive to most or for the security that patriarchy offered. =
But not all of this resistance was simply reactionary. Some of it was based=
 on a correct assessment that the new society emerging in Germany was oppre=
ssive in a different way. Those who still felt some allegiance to precapita=
list values sensed that Weimar society provided little opportunity for many=
 people to feel good about themselves, or to feel confident that what they =
bad managed to achieve for themselves in their work, family life, and commu=
nity was likely to survive the winds of change.</span></p>

t;background:white"><span style=3D"font-size:10.0pt;Times New Roman">In the=
se circumstances, the fascist Right has developed a formula that wins it co=
nsiderable mass appeal, and that, under some conditions, allows it to gain =
power. First, it validates these concerns. Second, it proposes that people =
can overcome the alienation they experience in daily life by becoming part =
of a fantasized community&mdash;the powerful Nation. But in fact, the exper=
ience of being part of the Nation doesn&rsquo;t work for very long, because=
 after the parades and the song-fests and spectacles, people return to the =
alienating workplaces and oppressive family relations that shape their dail=
y lives. The Nation, in other words, is a fantasized community&mdash;provid=

o to part three of the fascist program: the identification of an Enemy, who=
 has somehow insinuated itself into the daily life of the nation and underm=
ined the experience of solidarity and mutual caring that supposedly would h=
ave been there otherwise. This Enemy is typically the Jew or the Communist,=
 but also, in the case of&#160;David&#160;Duke&rsquo;s American brand of pr=
otofascism, the Blacks (now carefully identified in speeches with such code=
d references as &ldquo;welfare cheats&rdquo; or &ldquo;beneficiaries of was=
teful government pro- grams&rdquo;). Whichever identity this Enemy assumes,=
 it must be rooted out if the people of the nation are to achieve the human=
 satisfactions and community that they seek.</span></p>

tion and culture in which it is rooted, it would also directly challenge ra=
cist and national chauvinist accounts of the pain and powerlesness in peopl=

are real risks in identifying with&#160;<i>any</i>&#160;nationalism&mdash;a=
nd you can see grim testimony to those risks in the other pieces in this sp=
ecial section of the magazine. Thus we might consider addressing some of th=
e same concerns in another form. For example, I&rsquo;ve suggested that the=
 American Left adopt a progressive profamily program that would substantial=
ly address the same issues of alienation, powerlessness, and self-blame tha=
t a progressive nationalism would seek to address&mdash;and yet avoid some =
of the problematic features of nationalism (though I acknowledge that much =
of my argument could also be used to support an attempt to develop a progre=
ssive appropriation of national symbols of history). Once again, we start b=
y acknowledging that people are correct to feel that there is a real proble=
m in family life and that people&rsquo;s desire for long-term loving and co=
mmitted relationships is a legitimate desire. We then try to separate these=
 legitimate concerns from the reactionary elements of family life that the =
Right has appealed to&mdash;the oppressive patriarchal order, the insistenc=
e on only one &ldquo;correct&rdquo; form of family life, the attempt to sti=
gmatize gays and feminists.</span></p>

ressive profamily program would include gay families and single-parent fami=
lies. And rather than idealize the pathologies that afflict many existing f=
amilies, it would acknowledge the pain and stress that often distorts famil=
y life, and would then help people understand this pain as part of a larger=
 set of competitive, market-dominated social relations. People are rewarded=
 in the marketplace precisely because they succeed in manipulating and cont=
rolling others. Yet these very qualities, embodied in the &ldquo;smooth ope=
rators&rdquo; and &ldquo;cool people&rdquo; who &ldquo;make it&rdquo; in th=
e competitive marketplace create narcissistic personalities: precisely the =
character types that are unable to make long-term loving commitments in fam=
ily life, or even in friendships. Even when they genuinely wish to achieve =
intimacy, they don&rsquo;t know how to stop manipulating and attempting to =
control the very people they wish to have as lovers or friends. And the str=
ess that people experience in the world of work&mdash;a direct function of =
the way that work gives people little opportunity to fulfill their capaciti=
es for creativity, intelligence, cooperation, and self-determination&mdash;=
is brought home into family life. There it often erupts in irritability, de=
pression, insensitivity, or a general lack of energy and awareness, each of=
 which works to undermine loving relationships. This is just one realm&mdas=
h;albeit an extremely important one&mdash;in which the Left could develop w=
hat I call a politics of meaning. This isn&rsquo;t a question merely of pro=
viding a set of economic benefits to families or to provide family rights (=
though I think we should&#160;<i>also</i>&#160;develop a Bill of Rights for=
 workers and for families). Rather, it&rsquo;s a question of helping people=
 understand why it&rsquo;s so hard to build loving relationships, acknowled=
ging their pain, helping them to stop blaming themselves, and allowing them=
 to see that some personal problems are rooted in societal pathologies. Onc=
e the Left begins to address the pains of daily life, it can provide many d=
eeper and ultimately more fulfilling ways for people to understand what is =
actually bothering them.</span></p>

#160;Duke-style fascism in the nineties. If current trends continue, many o=
f this country&rsquo;s leading industrial corporations will move manufactur=

pending of the Reagan and Bush years will thwart the development of an econ=
omic and educational infrastructure that could give the U.S. a competitive =
advantage in the emerging scientific and technological revolutions in produ=
ction. As a result, the standing of the U.S. in the international capitalis=
t market will continue to slip. Growing unemployment and inflation will pro=
duce a sense of general despair about the future. One plausible Left respon=
se to such conditions would be to push for a worldwide system of rational p=
lanning&mdash;both to deal with the ecological crisis that threatens to des=
troy the entire world, and to prevent a new clash between rival nationalism=
s. A progressive approach to international planning would require both a re=
fined ecological sensitivity and a fair allocation of the world&rsquo;s res=
ources and productive capacities, advantaging countries equally, taking int=
o account the needs of the Third World as well as of the advanced industria=
l societies. Without such an international plan, we are likely to face a tw=
enty-first century plagued by ecological disasters and competing economic n=
ationalisms. And it is not unthinkable that the U.S., unable to rely on its=
 waning superiority in science, engineering, and productive technology, wou=
ld be tempted to turn to the one arena where it&#160;<i>has</i>&#160;commit=

 on, or that our marriages and families are likely to collapse. Or it could=
 be the painful realization that work has proved to be a &ldquo;dead end&rd=

housands of consciousness-raising groups in workplaces and communities that=
 will encourage people to understand their personal pain in its full social=
 context. The Left must also redesign and adopt the technologies of individ=
ual transformation, so well utilized both by the twelve-step programs of th=

empower and mobilize people to a different kind of politics. The Left can a=
