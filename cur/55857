Hi John, 

Hope all is well.  I know you are swamped, but if it's possible, I'd love to get a few minutes to talk about what might or might not work out for me in the new administration.  Happy to email if better.  And if it's premature or not worth talking about, I understand.  

On another note, in the Seattle forum this week, Bill Gates really embraced a new deal for teachers, including performance pay and tenure reform.  Randi and John Wilson did not push back. If Obama wants to do reform, he could get a very strong launch through a event with Gates, business leaders, and governors.  

Best wishes,

Robert
