On our way back to Park AV to get warm clothes. Call and we can decide
which place to meet up at.
One last thought about tomorrow. Do you want to invite Vin and his wife to
apartment tomorrow. Eat Greek leftovers. Gabe and Mae will probably show up
around 1:00. We could invite them at 12:00-12:30 and the kids can get there
whenever.
