      Dear Friend,

   7 Million. And counting.

   [1][IMG]That's how many people have signed up for private insurance
   through the Obamacare health exchanges. Add in a few million more people
   who are helped because they are under 26 and can stay on their parents
   health insurance or won't get kicked off their current coverage because =
of
   lifetime caps and you've got many many millions of Americans doing better
   because of Obamacare.

   We're REALLY proud of these facts here at ProgressNow Colorado Education.

   The right's entire campaign strategy is to attack this law from now
   through the election in November. [2]Donate $25 right now to fight again=
st
   the attacks on this successful law.

   We worked hard to get Obamacare passed back in 2009. We worked hard to
   counter the millions and millions of dollars the right wing has thrown at
   destroying this new law before it ever had a chance to help people. The
   Thanks Obamacare campaign was credited, in part, with getting President
   Obama to embrace the word Obamacare. The right tried to brand Obamacare =
as
   a slur, we fought to turn it back into a positive. We worked hard to get
   the word out about the health insurance exchanges. Our Got Insurance
   campaign became the face of marketing to the all-important young
   invincible crowd. We reached tens of millions of people with those
   ads--ads we spent about $5,000 to create.

   If you've donated money to us before, your contribution helped get those=
 7
   million people signed up for quality health care. You did that. We
   couldn't do what we do without you. The war is not over. [3]Chip in $25 =
or
   maybe even $50 for the next Obamacare battle.

   So today we celebrate. Hard work and a $25 contribution go a really long
   way here at ProgressNow Colorado Education. And we're not going to stop.
   2014 is a big year for health care. We'll keep working hard so you get a
   huge bang for your buck.

   Thanks so much,
   Jen Caltrider

   PS - [4]Please donate right now.
