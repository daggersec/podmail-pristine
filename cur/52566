Dear Mr. Podesta,

I am the writer for Georgetown Law's alumni magazine, and we are writing a =
story for the fall issue looking at the environmental law program at George=
town.
We will be leading the story with the proposed EPA rule to reduce carbon em=
issions for power plants and the role of the Georgetown Climate Center in t=
his area. Since you discussed the proposed rule at the Christian Science Mo=
nitor Breakfast on June 6, we wanted to include a mention of this in our st=
ory.

Would you have a few minutes for a phone interview on this subject, or woul=
d you like to supply a brief quote in an e-mail--explaining the importance =
of the proposed rule, how it will improve health and the environment, that =
sort of thing?

If you are pressed for time, we could likely include a brief line from the =
C-SPAN video with the proper attribution, but I wanted to give you the oppo=
rtunity to supply a quote for our alumni audience if you wish. Thank you ve=
ry much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.


Best,

Ann Parks
