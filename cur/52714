Dear John,

Thanks to you, President Barack Obama is on his way to a second
term.=A0 We're sending seven new  environmental champions to the
U.S. Senate, and we defeated 11 members of the  Dirty Dozen, including
four of the climate-denying House incumbents we targeted  as part of
our new Flat Earth Five campaign.

Your commitment to this organization was the critical piece that
helped us win  so many important races.=A0 And as we move  past the
2012 election, your partnership with LCV will help us advance strong
climate policies in 2013 and beyond.

We look forward to our continued  partnership in 2013 and wish you a
joyful holiday season.

With deep appreciation,

Gene

LCV: Our Impact  on the Election

LCV  entered the 2012 election cycle with a clear goal: protect our
environmental  allies and build support for addressing climate
change.=A0 By that standard, 2012 was LCV's most successful
electoral cycle ever.=A0 We spent nearly  $14 million, more than
the last three cycles combined, and in doing so  elected clean energy
champions and defeated 11 members of the Dirty Dozen.

Last  week, LCV launched an interactive website, which allows users to
navigate  through LCV's priority races and easily access TV ads, mail
pieces, photos and  other information about our political
programs.=A0  Please check out the website to see firsthand what
you helped make  possible by going to: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DdZW=

Pushing  for Wind Energy Incentives and Fighting Against Threats to
the Environment in  the Lame Duck Session

There are a number of factors converging that make this a
particularly high  stakes lame duck session: a host of taxes and
incentives (including the Bush tax cuts) expire at end of the year and
the  mandatory sequestration of both domestic and defense spending
takes effect at  the start of 2013 due to the Budget Control Act
compromise struck in August  2011.=A0 Due to the potential for
these  measures to drive the nation back into recession, these impacts
have been  collectively referred to as the "fiscal cliff."

LCV has been working with our allies on the looming fiscal cliff
that is  all-consuming for both Congress and the Obama
administration.=A0 LCV's top  priorities are extending expiring
clean energy tax incentives, including the  Production Tax Credit that
is critical to the wind industry's continued growth,  and we are
supporting the President's call for a balanced approach to resolving
our nation's fiscal challenges by calling for new revenues by cutting
the  billions in taxpayer-funded subsidies Big Oil gets every
year.=A0 LCV is also  working with a diverse coalition to deliver
the message of just how damaging  the mandatory sequestration cuts
would be for environmental programs.=A0 LCV  recently organized an
environmental community lobby day on the fiscal cliff  with nearly 100
Hill offices, sent an alert to  our members, and is preparing an
online campaign to call attention to the  need to repeal oil
subsidies. http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DdldPi-kTyfReJU8gfoQUng

2012 Elections:  Securing Victories at the State Level

Given on-going  congressional gridlock, LCV is finding more and more
opportunities to promote  environmental, clean energy and public
health policies in the states. =A0With our more than 30 state LCV
partners, we  are uniquely positioned to build political power and
momentum for sound  environmental policy through state and local
actions.

That is why in 2012  LCV invested more resources than ever before at
the state and local level.=A0 With the help of national LCV, the
state LCVs  collectively spent nearly $9 million on state elections
and achieved  many critical successes, including helping to elect two
pro-environment  governors and winning pro-environment majorities in
legislatures in Colorado,  Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York
and Oregon.

Some other key  highlights from the states include:

- Across the country, state LCVs endorsed in 1,072 races and won 844
of  them for a 79 percent win record. =A0State  LCV resources were
focused in 192 targeted races, helping to elect 116  pro-conservation
candidates, with three others still too close to call.

- State LCVs were successful in defeating seven of the state Dirty
Dozen, which highlights 12 of the most anti-environmental state-level
candidates in competitive races across the country. =A0State-level
Dirty Dozen candidates were  defeated in Colorado, Minnesota, Montana,
New Mexico, New York, Oregon and  Pennsylvania.

- Washington Conservation Voters PAC made its largest independent
expenditure ever, investing more than $750,000 to help elect Jay
Inslee as  governor of Washington.=A0 We anticipate  that Inslee,
who campaigned aggressively on clean energy, will be the greenest
governor in the country.=A0 Montana  Conservation Voters spent more
than $100,000 to help elect Steve Bullock to the  open gubernatorial
seat in Montana. =A0With  an aggressively anti-conservation
legislature, maintaining control of the  governor's office was
critical.

- State LCV's played a role in helping to pass at least 12 state
pro-environment ballot measures.

We firmly believe that a  commitment to building political power from
the local level up will lead to a  cleaner, healthier future for
families across the country.

Thank you again for being part of  LCV's Environmental Majority
Council.=A0  Happy holidays!
