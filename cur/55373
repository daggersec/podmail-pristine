Dear John,

I wonder what it will take to finally get America to wake up and pass  comp=
rehensive clean energy and climate change legislation.

I thought we would finally see landmark environmental change this year. But=
 what did we get from the U.S. Senate? Nothing. =A0

I'm convinced we need more focus on key solutions -- like electing new lead=
ers. Leaders who will again pick up the fight for strong climate policies t=
hat crack down on corporate polluters and transition us to a clean energy e=
conomy.

Will you join me? Click here to help bring down the Dirty Dozen so we can c=
ontinue working to pass laws that protect the environment. =A0Contribute
to the LCV Victory Fund today.=20

In July, we learned that the U.S. Senate wouldn't take up comprehensive cle=
an energy and climate legislation before their summer recess, likely doomin=
g its chances this year. Then the Senate left town without even voting on a=
 bill to hold BP responsible for the catastrophe in the Gulf.

An unquestionably broad majority supports moving to clean energy and addres=
sing climate change. But again and again, Big Oil, Dirty Coal and their all=
ies in Congress, led by the Republican leadership stand stubbornly in
the way of progress.=A0

They have polluted the halls of Congress long enough.=A0=20

Because of their obstruction, we're sending $1 billion overseas to buy oil =
every single day.=A0 Because of their defiance, we have more pollution but =
fewer green jobs.=A0 Because they've been bought by the special interests, =
Big Oil
and Dirty Coal's cronies in Congress have more to say about U.S. energy
policy than you or I.

But we can fix this, John. We don't have to tolerate this attack on our ene=
rgy future.=A0 Election Day 2010 gives us our chance to bring to U.S. Senat=
e new environmental champions - like Paul Hodes, Robin Carnahan and Joe Ses=
tak - who will fight for the laws we need to protect the planet.=A0

When it comes to educating the public about environmental issues, no one ru=
ns a better program than the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund.=A0=
 I
can assure you that your gift will be a sound investment in a shrewd strate=
gy and the most state-of-the-art campaign tactics.=A0 But in order to have =
all the
pieces in place, all the money needs to be in the door by September 20.=A0

Give to the LCV Victory Fund today and contribute to an early retirement fo=
r the Dirty Dozen.

http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DQX1UiWutG58cx3-Xs3tAFw..

This is an opportunity to finally break the vice grip that the Big Polluter=
s have
on our environmental laws.=A0 Together, we can make an impact.

Sincerely,

Robert Redford
