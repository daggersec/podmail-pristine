BTW be very very very careful about HRC saying how she is all-in with Pelosi=
. Nancy's
game from the beginning was to be in on the fixed game.  She lost control of=
 her
caucus 2/3 or whom were pissed off at the deal she cut, so she changed tacti=
cs.

I come out of the House Democratic leadership under 3 Democratic speakers as=

well as working 6 years for Lloyd Bentsen.  I know how the game is played an=
d I know
how the fix was in, because I helped fix games under some of the best such a=
s Tip
and Jim Wright.

The Democratic base, labor union workers, liberals may not understand the nu=
ances
and sophistication about how these fixes are done, but they are madder than h=
ell
because they intuit this, they know they are getting a rotten deal, and I lo=
ve Nancy
like a mother and have been one of her most devout supporters.....but there a=
re=20
reasons Democrats have been lobotomized in the House and if Hillary goes int=
o the
election with negative ratings and lower trust she may back into the preside=
ncy if
the Republicans are bad enough, maybe not, but Dems don't have a snowballs
chance in hell of taking back the House....would be lucky with a 25% chance t=
o
get back the Senate......and Hillary winning this way may be like Krushchev'=
s line
about the living may envy dead and HRC may not be thrilled spending precious=

years on her hands and knees moving further right under Speaker Boehner and
Majority Leader McConnell......

It is smart-ass fixes like we are seeing now on trade that make insiders fee=
l clever
and make Democratic voters distrust Democratic politicians and stay home....=
