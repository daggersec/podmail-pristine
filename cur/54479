            Washington, D.C. =AD As part of its ongoing effort to hold
politicians accountable, Campaign Money Watch, a nonpartisan campaign
finance reform group, announced today that it was on the air with ads in
both Colorado and Alaska, both of which are home to two of the year=B9s mos=
t
competitive Senate races.
=20
            =B3This year=B9s Senate races will determine whether Congress w=
ill
crack down on the influence and power of big money donors next year,=B2 sai=
d
David Donnelly, Campaign Money Watch=B9s director. =B3The contests in Color=
ado
and Alaska are ones in which voters have a chance to send a strong message
to politicians that they want real reform of the pay-to-play system in
Washington.=B2
=20
            In Colorado, the group=B9s new ad, =B3Investigator,=B2 highligh=
ts a
trip made by U.S. Senate candidate Bob Schaffer (R-CO) to the Northern
Mariana Islands that was billed as a fact-finding mission but was really a
junket funded by jailed lobbyist Jack Abramoff=B9s firm. Schaffer turned hi=
s
back to reports of abusive labor practices and defended the sweatshops whil=
e
taking thousands of dollars from their owners. It calls on Schaffer to help
end the corrupting influence of money in politics and support comprehensive
campaign finance reform. This is the organization=B9s second ad of the cycl=
e
in Colorado.

            The ad is available online at
http://www.campaignmoney.org/schaffer.

            Sen. Ted Stevens (R-AK) is the subject of another ad, =B3Scratc=
h,=B2
notes that Stevens has received $581,000 from the health care industry all
while supporting its agenda on Capitol Hill, and opposing allowing Medicare
to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. The ad is posted online at
http://www.campaignmoney.org/stevens.
=20
            Both ads will run on broadcast stations. The combined spending
in the two states for these ads is approximately $570,000, with future
advertising likely to be scheduled.
=20
            Campaign Money Watch is a project of the nonpartisan Public
Campaign Action Fund. The organization works to hold politicians who are
against comprehensive campaign finance reform accountable for where they ge=
t
their political donations.
