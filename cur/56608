+ John for SA=20

Thanks, Ami. We sure appreciate all the heavy lifting you all are doing for=
 us. I briefed P again tonight on the walk on all the work you're doing (Vi=
etnam + Srebenica + Greece) and he, too and most importantly, was very grat=
eful. =20

If you all have time tomorrow AM in Srebenica, we now do/do think a call to=
 PM Tsipras would also be very helpful. If useful, I'd gladly call into you=
r traveling party to give you our best sense of where things stand. =20

The message for PM Tsipras would be a version of the following (though we'd=
 also gladly develop more robust paper/talkers if helpful):=20

1) The PM should stay calm and engaged even if his interlocutors at times s=
eem to make unreasonable demands.=20

2) An underscoring of the importance of staying in Euro for both geopolitic=
al and economic reasons.=20

3) A recognition that debt re-profiling is an important win for Greece and =
for growth.=20

4) And a reminder that it is important to be mindful that Merkel and other =
European leaders also have political challenges in their democracies and ne=
ed reforms to be credible.=20
