John --

Yesterday, most of the Republicans in the New Jersey General Assembly =
declared that partisan politics trumps protecting families from gun =
violence.=20

I've had enough of this nonsense.

Instead of overriding Governor Christie's veto of legislation that =
previously passed 74-0 and would have made it harder for those with =
violent mental health records to obtain guns, many Republicans changed =
their minds to protect Christie's political ambitions.

Democrats are going to attempt to override Christie's veto again, so we =
need to you to tell the Republicans that it's time for action to help end =
gun violence:

http://act.NewWay4NJ.com/Override-the-Vetoes

In addition to vetoing legislation aimed at keeping firearms out of the =
hands of those who are a clear danger to themselves and others, Christie =
also vetoed a bill that would require convicted domestic abusers to turn =
in their guns to law enforcement.

This issue is personal for my wife Tammy and me.

Together, we've led an organization that helps domestic abuse survivors. =
Tammy and I have listened to these survivors and have heard stories from =
many on how they feared for their lives. They deserve the peace of mind =
that comes from knowing their abuser no longer has access to the guns they =
obtained before a conviction or restraining order.

Sign the petition to override Christie's vetoes and help keep firearms out =
of the hands of convicted domestic abusers and people with violent mental =
health disorders:
