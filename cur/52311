Absolutely worth discussing. The IPC focus was on avoiding a global race to=
 the bottom on corporate tax- so it had a little more in mind that particul=
ar oecd countries cut their corp tax to get companies to move to them (I th=
ink Ireland is like the prototypical example). But definitely was global pr=
oposal. Marc and perhaps Alex can discuss w John N areas of joint work.

Sort of buried in the back of the report is a section on tax avoidance and =
international tax competition which references some OECD lines of work
Africans are hepped up on having OECD help them on tracking illegal financi=
al flows. This is area where there is little outside work or advocacy. I th=
ink if Mark and John did some work combining the development challenge with=
 the domestic issues/effects discussed in the. Commission Report, it could =
get noticed and have some impact. Best time to do that would be in the run =
up to the Financing for Development Conference taking place in I Addis this=
 summer.
Worth discussing?
