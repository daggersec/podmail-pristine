Friend,=20

Governor Quinn is taking the minimum wage challenge to draw attention t=
o the struggles that far too many Illinois families face every single d=
ay=2E

He=E2=80=99s living on just $79 this week -- that=E2=80=99s all that so=
meone who makes minimum wage in Illinois has left after taking out for =
housing, transportation, and taxes=2E

Minimum wage workers aren't just high schoolers at their first jobs=2E =
Often, they=E2=80=99re parents just trying to provide for their childre=
n and put enough food on the table -- all on a wage that hasn=E2=80=99t=
 kept up with the times=2E

Governor Quinn is determined to change that, but he can=E2=80=99t do it=
 alone=2E

Add your name if you agree it=E2=80=99s time to raise the minimum wage:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/not-enough

The math is simple:

Work full-time at $8=2E25 an hour, and you make $330 a week=2E Subtract=
 for the average cost of housing, transportation, and taxes, and you=E2=
=80=99re left with just $79 for everything else=2E

$79 a week isn=E2=80=99t enough to live here in Illinois -- or anywhere=
 else=2E

$79 a week to cover not just food, but all of life=E2=80=99s other expe=
nses -- a car repair, cold medicine for a sick child, school supplies -=
- as well?

It just doesn=E2=80=99t cut it=2E

The Governor is helping shine a light on what it=E2=80=99s like to live=
 on the minimum wage=2E Now it=E2=80=99s up to us to help him fix this=2E

Add your name today to say you support raising the minimum wage:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/not-enough

Thanks,

Izabela
