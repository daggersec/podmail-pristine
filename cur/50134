Hi John -

Hope that you are well. I will try and keep this as brief as possible.

I have been approached by several former staffers of the National Security
Network who are concerned that the existing infrastructure on the
progressive side to defend progressives and HRC on national security policy
this cycle is not anything like the capabilities that existed in the 2008
cycle. And it is a crucial weakness as it looks as if the GOP will be
emphasizing national security and whatever their recent stumbles on Iraq,
they can't be underestimated given the state of the world. I agree with
them.

Richard Fontaine told one former NSN staffer when he joined CNAS that NSN
was the biggest pain in the ass during the McCain campaign. Fontaine said
every time they made a statement on foreign policy, minutes later NSN would
issue a press release about why it was stupid.

NSN doesn't do that kind of work anymore as by necessity it has evolved
into much more of a policy-oriented shop over the last eight years as it
has received more foundation funding. Truman never did that. And CAP and
ThinkProgress are certainly in this space and did good work in 2008 and
likely will again, but we're not focused on this aspect 100% of the time.

We think that it is necessary to rebuild this capability. It can be a part
of the existing structure of outside groups supporting HRC or it could be
its own free-standing group. I know of at least four people who would be
interested in participating in this effort, including myself.

Please let me know if you think this is a worthwhile idea.

My best,
Ken
