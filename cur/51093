Andy Burnham and / or Yvette Cooper (Ed Balls wife, he lost his seat). They=
'll likely collaborate.

Tristram Hunt and Chuka will collaborate, maybe with Dan Jarvis (a former p=
aratrooper who served in Afghanistan) as new generation, possibly with Stel=
la McCartney.

Someone on far left - Perhaps Diane Abbott.

It's early days. People in party think Chuka is too smooth, but the public =
really like him. Also, party leadership
process has been reformed, so unions & affiliates will be less influential.
