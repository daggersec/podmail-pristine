Hi Christina:

Just spoke with our energy folks about the line in the speech on "using
additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the
environment" -- a reference to reforming the royalties paid for energy
extraction on public land. Their only potential concern was that folks in
the environmental community will view this as a step towards a carbon tax
(thus raising expectations) -- whereas it's really going to be a more
targeted proposal (in line with some Obama Administration reforms) aimed at
making sure that taxpayers get their fair share in federal royalties.

We think it's unlikely that this will be much of an issue, as the language
in the speech was pretty specific. But, to be safe, the team is developing
some talking points that (1) withhold details until the summer but (2)
emphasize that we're talking about royalties on federal land (rather than a
broader carbon tax). We just wanted you to have this background, in case
you got any questions on this -- and let us know if there seems to be
interest in the issue.

Copying Milia to make sure that this is consistent with where John is on
this.

Thanks a bunch,

Mike
