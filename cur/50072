John--Qs from Elizabeth at High Country Mag re: your pre-WH Wyss consulting
contract, financial disclosures, and possible conflict of interest.  She
wants to know the nature of your work for them.  Elizabeth is erroneously
tying it to conservation, so should we set the record straight with her?

I can confirm that's the authentic form, but won't until you say to.

Her deadline is Monday.

Should we let Molly know as a heads up?  Either now, or after you answer
Elizabeth?

Thanks,
Eryn

Hi Eryn,

Editors are asking me about John's work for Wyss foundation. Can you
confirm that this financial disclosure form below is authentic? (I
requested document directly from White House but in case it doesn't arrive
by my deadline) Can you say anything about what John did for Wyss and
whether he has addressed whether his efforts on behalf of conservation,
such as his Politico story, were tied to that? Does he consider that work
to have been a conflict of interest with his work at White House?

I'm afraid my deadline is Monday. The story goes to the presses on Thursday.

Thank you very much.
Elizabeth
