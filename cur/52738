Sorry, I missed this last night (the trouble with multiple
blackberrys). I did talk to Pete. We will pull together materials for
Thursday early am that you can review.  I think overall things are
proceeding well and that the most important decisions you need to
think about before election day involve personnel (White House,
national security and economic teams), the structural issues of how,
when and  who should relate to Treasury during the transition, and how
to manage/engage with the lame duck session on the stimulus.
I'll get you an update memo and background reading on a range of
matters we are handling, together with decisions that need to be made
by Nov. 4 by Thursday early am. Let me know if you want to talk by
phone today.
