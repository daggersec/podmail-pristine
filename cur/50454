SSG Martinez's interest in the case is precisely why it will likely go
unsolved.  SSgt Martinez may never use the toaster (and even benefits from
its demise) yet is nonetheless very upset about it.  Similarly, I never
knew we had a toaster until I learned of the safety violation, but
similarly want desperately to catch the culprit.

TSgt Garrison has two daughters. He was in Iraq on his oldest's first day
in kindergarten. He will be in Qatar next month when his youngest goes to
kindergarten. He wants to be there with them and not here with us.  But he
is stuck here with us and tries to find little things to enjoy--like
toasted sandwiches for lunch.  So despite the fact that the toaster is
rarely used, it nonetheless has been jarring to all of us because if
someone here is mean-spirited enough to take away TSgt Garrison's simple
joys, what is stopping them from taking my peanut butter, for instance?

Because the community here is so outraged, the punishment will likely be
severe.  My advice to the Command would be to immediately send the person
home for misconduct, a career ending punishment.  Whoever committed the
crime lives and works amongst us and thus knows the outrage.  So he or she
will almost certainly keep the secret and we won't solve it, despite my
best J.B. Fletcher efforts.

While that is terribly sad, the whole episode has seemed to bring us
together and actually may have served to improve morale in a strange way.
So I'm grateful for that.

I'll keep you posted if there are any developments and thanks for all the
assistance.  Sorry I can't give you more resolution!

G Martinez (1 of the 3 coffee makers) tested the scissors. He cut the remai=

 They are. This news was immediately greeted with accusations from his cowo=

 one has arrived to take fingerprints, by the way. <br>

experiencing a real life Murder, She Wrote here in Qatar. =C2=A0No one is d=
ead (just a toaster oven) but there are so many suspects and motives.<br>
There is a small toaster oven in our office kitchen area. =C2=A0The toaster=
 and the coffee pot are both 110 volts, so each must be plugged into the 22=
0 volt transformer when in use. =C2=A0The transformer only has room for one=
 at a time, so a user must check and change, as appropriate, with each and =
every use. =C2=A0This seems to be a particular frustration to the three peo=
ple who typically make the coffee in the morning.<br>
TSgt Garrison is the only person that actually uses the toaster. =C2=A0He t=
ypically toasts his sandwich bread at lunch time. =C2=A0He has only been he=
re for a month or so. =C2=A0Prior to his arrival the three who make coffee =
kept the coffee pot plugged in at all times.<br>
This morning LT Farnsworth was the first in the office and went to the kitc=
hen to make coffee. =C2=A0He reports that he walked in to discover that som=
eone had cut the cord to the toaster oven, rendering it inoperable. =C2=A0N=
ext to the toaster was a pair of scissors. =C2=A0The part of the cord that =
plugs into the outlet was not found. =C2=A0<br>
LT Farnsworth is a reservist (i.e. he has a civilian job and only puts on t=
he uniform one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer). =C2=A0He was a=
ctivated and deployed here against his will and recently learned that he mi=
ssed out on a promotion at his civilian job because his employer needs to f=
ill the position immediately and will not wait for him to return. =C2=A0He =
is also a hothead--he reportedly committed a cardinal sin during predeploym=
ent training when he grew frustrated by his marksmanship and threw his rifl=
e to the ground (very, very big no-no in military culture). =C2=A0<br>
Lest you believe that LT Farnsworth is the only suspect, please note that T=
Sgt Garrison lives with TSgt Long. =C2=A0The two are very different and see=
m to truly hate one another. =C2=A0It is unclear, however, if TSgt Long kno=
ws that TSgt Garrison uses the toaster oven because he works in a different=
 building.<br>
Additionally, yesterday we had a random safety inspection by the Camp As Sa=
yliyah Fire Department. =C2=A0We passed, but were marked down because the t=
oaster oven was on top of the microwave and that is a fire hazard. =C2=A0MS=
G Brown is responsible for office safety and thus was forced to take respon=
sibility for the hazard despite the fact that she, too, works in a differen=
t building.<br>
When we were alerted to the safety violation yesterday, my paralegal decide=
d to assist by printing a sign that read =E2=80=9CDo not place toaster on t=
op of the microwave. =C2=A0It is a fire hazard.=E2=80=9D =C2=A0While well i=
ntentioned, she taped the paper sign directly on top of the toaster. =C2=A0=
This, as you may have guessed, is a fire hazard. =C2=A0The sign was removed=
 and she was ridiculed.<br>
I am truly at a loss. =C2=A0I feel like all these episodes of Murder, She W=
rote have been preparing me to solve this mystery. =C2=A0Any insight or hel=
p you all may provide is greatly appreciated and I&#39;ll keep you posted o=
f any developments.<br>
