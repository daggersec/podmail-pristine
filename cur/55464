I was very proud to be a (somewhat newly minted) Californian this week as G=
overnor Jerry Brown signed an Executive Order setting North America's most =
ambitious target for reducing heat-trapping pollution. California is alread=
y on track to outperform its current target for 2020 as well as its 33 perc=
ent renewable electricity portfolio standard, and there is every reason to =
believe that it can achieve the new 40 percent reduction by 2030 target. Of=
 course, California can't solve climate change by itself, but there is a lo=
ng history demonstrating that when California leads, the United States, and=
 the World, follows, as I recount in my post:

http://nextgenamerica.org/climate-change/california-ups-the-climate-ante/

California's ambitious climate policies, particularly its low carbon fuels =
standard, will be a significant deterrent to using fuel made from dirty tar=
 sands oil within the state. But more needs to be done to prevent the West =
Coast tar sands invasion that the oil industry has planned, with its sights=
 set on international markets. By rail or by ship, tar sands oil threatens =
local communities as well as our climate, as Colin Murphy explains:

http://nextgenamerica.org/climate-change/how-the-west-coast-can-avoid-a-tar=
-sands-train-wreck/

While California is charting a course to an advanced energy economy and com=
munities are organizing to say no to tar sands oil, some utility executives=
 are stuck in the past. Nick Akins, the CEO of American Electric Power, can=
't seem to let go of the idea that burning coal without carbon pollution li=
mits is the backbone of the American dream, despite the thousands of people=
 killed by pollution from coal plants each year. He told the New York Times=
 last week that "there will be blackouts" if the Clean Power Plan is adopte=
d as proposed.  Given that there is no analytical support for that claim, D=
ave Weiskopf asks: Is AEP making a threat?
