Dear John, 


I know how tough this economy has been for most Americans, so I'm all the more grateful for the way you've stepped up to the plate and given so generously to my campaign. Because of you and thousands of others, we are in a strong position to win in 2012. I just can't thank you enough.

It means so much to me to have such a dedicated group of supporters to help me fight for the causes we believe in. I simply couldn't do this without you.

All the best,

Kirsten
