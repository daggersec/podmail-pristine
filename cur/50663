>> Tony previously sent you the attached invite to a reception and fundraise=
r for our daughter Megan Rouse, who is running for School Board in Dublin, C=
A.  Megan is serving on the Board, having been picked through a merit select=
ion process to fill a vacancy. She is doing a great job and is sort of runni=
ng for re-election, but this is her first time before the voters.  Of course=
, we are super proud of her and the work she is doing. While you probably ar=
en't too vested in the outcome of local California school board races, we ho=
pe you can support her candidacy, even at a modest level, as she begins her c=
areer as an elected official. Good to get in on the ground floor.
