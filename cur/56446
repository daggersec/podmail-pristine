In light of President Obama's appearance on Letterman tonight, here's our t=
ake on the top 10 reasons hard-working Americans lose when insurance compan=
ies win.

Top Ten Reasons Why YOU LOSE When Insurance Companies Win

10.     YOU could be one of the 14,000 Americans who lose their coverage ev=
ery day<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2009/02/health_in_cris=
is.htmlhttp:/www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2009/02/health_in_crisis=
.html> - while insurance company CEOs rake in as much as $38 million<http:/=
/www.forbes.com/lists/2009/12/best-boss-09_Ronald-A-Williams_NBHZ.html> a y=
ear.

9.      YOUR employer could drop coverage<http://ehbs.kff.org/> because the=
ir costs are projected to rise over 166 percent<http://www.washingtonpost.c=
om/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/15/AR2009091501175.html> in ten years wit=
hout reform - which insurance companies are secretly organizing to kill<htt=
p://thinkprogress.org/2009/09/17/potter-charm-dirty-campaign/>.

8.      YOU could go bankrupt due to medical costs<http://pnhp.org/new_bank=
ruptcy_study/Bankruptcy-2009.pdfhttp:/pnhp.org/new_bankruptcy_study/Bankrup=
tcy-2009.pdf> even if you have insurance -insurance companies refuse to pla=
ce a cap on the amount of money you can spend in the event of a serious ill=
ness, and 78 percent of people who filed for medical bankruptcy had insuran=
ce.  Insurance company executives act unaware<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress=
.org/2009/09/18/insurers-bankruptcy/> of this crisis even as they take your=
 premium payments year in and year out.

7.      YOU will continue to have little or no choice<http://www.americanpr=
ogress.org/issues/2009/06/pdf/health_competitiveness.pdf> when it comes to =
health care -because one or two insurance companies have a stranglehold on =
the market in the vast majority of states, and the insurance industry is sp=
ending $2.5 million a month<http://www.campaignmoney.org/top_14_insurer_spe=
nders> to keep it that way.

6.      YOU will continue to be swamped by unintelligible paperwork<http://=
www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2009/September/18/communications.aspx> - w=
ith 77 percent of Americans unable to understand health insurance terms, an=
d insurance companies free to use mistakes on your enrollment forms<http://=
www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/07/AR2009090702455_pf=
.html> as reasons to cancel coverage.

5.      If you're a woman, YOU will continue to pay 48 percent more than me=
n for the same coverage<http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articl=
es/2009/08/22/competition_lacking_among_private_health_insurers/> on the in=
dividual market - because insurance companies deem women more expensive to =
insure and are free to charge practically whatever they want to preserve th=
eir profits at your expense.

4.      If you're older, YOU could be forced to pay 11 times more for cover=
age<http://www.newamerica.net/blog/new-health-dialogue/2009/health-reform-p=
hasing-out-age-rating-14315> - because insurance companies have wide leeway=
 to discriminate against you based on your age.

3.      YOU could be denied coverage for a "pre-existing condition"<http://=
www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/18/AR2009091803501.ht=
ml?referrer=3Ddigg> - which could be anything from acne to hay fever to pre=
gnancy, because insurance companies are free to deny coverage to anyone for=
 practically any reason to preserve their profits.

2.      YOU could see your coverage cancelled when you get sick<http://www.=
washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/07/AR2009090702455_pf.htm=
l> - because once you file a claim, insurance companies are free to scour y=
our records and find even the flimsiest reason to cancel your coverage - li=
ke a typo on your enrollment form, a condition you didn't even know you had=
, or a condition your spouse has.  Three insurance companies alone cancelle=
d 20,000 policies over a five year period to protect their bottom line at t=
heir policyholders' expense.

...And the number one reason why YOU LOSE when insurance companies win:

1.      Without reform, YOU will be at the mercy of insurance companies<htt=
p://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/07/AR200909070245=
5_pf.html> - because they will continue implementing their abusive practice=
s and raking in huge profits while your costs rise to as much as one-third =
of your family's income<http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/09/fami=
ly_health_spending.html>.
