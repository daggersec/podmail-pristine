John,

In recent weeks, State Representative Greg Heartsill has embarked on a dist=
urbing crusade that will lead to more LGBTQ students being bullied in schoo=
l.

Heartsill opposes the anti-bullying law being debated in the legislature, b=
ut he didn=E2=80=99t stop there. He=E2=80=99s singling out the Governor=E2=
=80=99s Conference on LGBTQ Youth (an annual anti-bullying event) with biza=
rre demands for information from Iowa educators about their level of partic=
ipation in the event. And he has spread false information, much of it taken=
 directly from Bob Vander Plaats and the Family Leader, who have been attac=
king the Governor=E2=80=99s conference for years.

Greg Heartsill=E2=80=99s singling out the Governor=E2=80=99s LGBTQ conferen=
ce amounts to nothing more than an anti-gay witch hunt, and it appears he w=
ill stop at nothing in his crusade. Will you help us hold him accountable?

We=E2=80=99re going to run a full-page ad in Heartsill=E2=80=99s hometown n=
ewspaper next week, to call him out for his anti-gay witch hunt. Donate tod=
ay and help us pay for the ad! Donate here: https://progressiowa.actionkit.=
com/donate/antigaygreg/?t=3D1001&akid=3D217.50925.jdd68I

With your help we will hold Heartsill accountable in his hometown paper and=
 make sure his constituents know what he=E2=80=99s been up to:
