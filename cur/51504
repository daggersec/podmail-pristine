John,

It was great to run into you at the Mess.  The staff has changed over so
much, you and Ron might be the only people I know there anymore so it was a
treat to see you both.  As I said, I had been meaning to be in touch but
now that you tell me you have talked about me on conference calls, I just
had to email.

Let me know when/if you have time to catch up.  Happy New Year!

Karen
