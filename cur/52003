Dear Friend,

Last week our campaign released a video called "Dear Mr. President".

We support the President, and believe Joe would be his fiercest, boldest, strongest ally in PA and DC.

"Dear Mr. President" was played in newscasts across Pennsylvania, as well as on national shows.  Across the internet, it was viewed by thousands:

    * "Objectively, the video makes its point well ... PA Democrats I've spoken to say that they can't wrap their heads around supporting someone who supported lawmakers, like Santorum or GW Bush, that make their blood boil." --  McCall's Pennsylvania Avenue [leading PA newspaper]

    * "No other candidate has captured their frustration better than U.S. Rep. Joe Sestak, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Democrat trying to take out one-time Republican U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter in the state's May primary.  -- Real Clear Politics [national political news organization]

    * "Sestak is taking a bold step ... as [an] anti-establishment politician."  -- Talking Points Memo [national political news organization]

    * "This is fantastic ... Joe Sestak could really use your support and this fantastic ad needs to be posted on as many progressive sites as possible." -- Firedoglake [leading national progressive blog

Yes, that video needs to be posted on as many websites as possible because it reminds us to believe again ... still in the President and my brother!  That video -- newsworthy -- caused such a spike in traffic to our campaign web-site, attracting donations and volunteers!

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=emar1link1

That video showed the courage of a new President and the courage of his supporters and our supporters that change can and will be delivered to PA and America, where it will not be just a change in needed policies, but where principle triumphs over politics.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=emar1link2

That video's message is breaking through!  We URGE YOU please make a contribution RIGHT NOW of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250, or whatever you are able to afford,  to get this acclaimed video "viral" across the internet, with multiple ads on multiple websites -- drawing further support to our campaign. 

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=emar1link3

WE ARE BREAKING THROUGH! Three days after the video's release  --  a poll was released that showed Senator Specter's support had dropped further  --  now just 25% of Pennsylvania voters believe that Specter deserves to be re-elected, and 65% think its time for a change! [Specter's re-elect numbers are now worse than former conservative PA Republican Senator Rick Santorum's numbers were before he was soundly defeated by Democrat Bob Casey in 2006.]

Our video made an impact.  And, we continue to rise ... as Specter's support crumbles.

Support the fighting spirit of the supporters of President Obama and my brother, who are fighting to bring real change to PA.

Look at the impact that video had over a few days time ... imagine the impact that video will have over the next few weeks.
 
Thank you.
Rich Sestak
Campaign Director
