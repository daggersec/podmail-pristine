Thanks Sara.

Just a minor correction on the Courage Campaign airplane banner, RE: "During
event, Courage Campaign did flyover with banner: "Sarah Palin, Thanks But No
Thanks on Prop 4"

Here's what it actually said:

SARAH PALIN - THANKS, BUT NO THANKS! NO ON PROP 4

As some of you might have seen from the press release we sent to the list
this morning, the Courage Campaign was attempting to pivot Palin's support
for parental notification laws in Alaska to her assumed support for Prop 4
in California. With the "Yes on 4" supporters in attendance handing out
signs to Republicans, it appears this Palinpalooza provided an opportunity
for both sides to get their message out.
