&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;&nbsp; Changes to the Labor part only- no other changes were made<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; *Labor*<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; *SEIU*<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In the 2004 Presidential election cycle, SEIU spent $65 million.&nbsp; In<br>
&gt; 2006<br>
&gt; &gt; mid term elections, SEIU built on that investment by spending $35<br>
&gt; million.<br>
&gt; &gt; SEIU&#39;s strategy focused on three key areas:&nbsp; the &quot;ground game,&quot; creating<br>
&gt; &gt; momentum in tier two and three districts around issues and ballot<br>
&gt; initiative<br>
&gt; &gt; campaigns, and strategic paid media.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In 2008, SEIU will continue working with these goals in mind and will<br>
&gt; &gt; contribute more in the 2008 cycle than ever in its history.&nbsp; The union<br>
&gt; is<br>
&gt; &gt; committed to electing a President, congress and state elected officials<br>
&gt; who<br>
&gt; &gt; support working men and women and their issues.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; *Change to Win*<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In 2006, Change to Win&#39;s efforts focused mainly on electing pro-worker<br>
&gt; &gt; gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania and<br>
&gt; &gt; Ohio.&nbsp; In all of the races to which Change to Win devoted significant<br>
&gt; &gt; resources, their candidates won.&nbsp; In addition to Change to Win&#39;s<br>
&gt; efforts,<br>
&gt; &gt; its affiliates spent close to $45 million on the 2006 elections.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In 2008, Change to Win&#39;s expanded political program will focus on 15-20<br>
&gt; &gt; states.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; *AFL-CIO*<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; A.F.L.-C.I.O. states that it mobilized millions of voters in several<br>
&gt; &gt; states during the 2006 elections, helping shift the balance of power in<br>
&gt; &gt; Congress.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; In 2008, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. plans to help elect &quot;a pro-worker president&quot;<br>
&gt; &gt; and help gain three to six &quot;pro-worker seats&quot; in the Senate and add five<br>
&gt; in<br>
&gt; &gt; the House by focusing on Congressional districts with many union<br>
&gt; members.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; The federation said that it would seek to reach out to voters, through a<br>
&gt; &gt; new affiliate, Working America that would enlist workers not in regular<br>
&gt; &gt; unions. The $53 million political budget for this cycle is up from $50<br>
&gt; &gt; million in the presidential cycle of 2003-04.<br>
