John,

I understand there may be a delay beyond today in announcing the PE's picks for senior DoD positions.

If so, per our earlier conversations, I would hope that at least the Deputy and Policy could be announced today or tomorrow morning so that the paperwork could be completed and a hearing scheduled for them next week.   We are running out of time to get any of these folks confirmed on the 20th.

Bob
