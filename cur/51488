Week starting February 1

Wins:

   -

   Quick Donate Queuing: Groundwork added support where Quick Donate
   donations are now queued, ensuring they can be processed in real-time wh=
en
   Stripe is healthy and queued when Stripe is unhealthy. This means we no
   longer lose Quick Donates when New Donate is running in failover mode. Y=
UGE!
   -

   Reporter/Aurora in Iowa: Reporter and Aurora were a big success in Iowa.
   The tools never dropped data, and Analytics was able to get the results
   they needed in real time.
   - We got results for 70% of the precincts in Iowa with ~800 precinct
      captains installing the app and ~600 using the app to submit data.
      - We caught ~50 discrepancies between our data & the Iowa Democratic
      Party=E2=80=99s data, which allowed the team to solve delegate compli=
cations in 6
      precincts.
      - Reporter saved the call center a significant volume of calls
      because precinct captains could both submit results & caucus issues
      directly through the app. 50% of the precincts results came directly
      through the Reporter app, and 50% came through through the call cente=
r.


Updates:

   -

   SMS tool aka Megaphone!: Our VAN chrome extension and SMS tool will now
   be known as Megaphone! Over the past week, we=E2=80=99ve been working to=
 improve
   the Megaphone so it can be more easily used across the early states and =
on
   into March states. We=E2=80=99re working on ways to allow states to add =
users and
   SMS templates to the tool (we have to do this manually now). It=E2=80=99=
s been used
   in NH to build for events and will be used on primary day for GOTV asks.
   -

   Mobile update: We are working on a =E2=80=9Cgamified experience=E2=80=9D=
 app to engage
   and activate supporters, specifically those who have not yet donated or
   volunteered. Our team of product, design, engineers and an illustrator a=
re
   working hard to target a Convention launch. We=E2=80=99re currently test=
ing
   different versions of design prototypes with users and working towards
   defining an appealing visual style with an illustrator.  We are also
   vetting the initial set of activities that users can complete in the app=
 to
   make sure we try a diverse set of activities and adapt any future
   activities based on user behavior.
   -

   HFA cloud for Vertica analytics: Tech is ready for Analytics to move
   over to the HFA cluster as we=E2=80=99ve finished the hardware and softw=
are
   upgrades. Limited load testing has been performed but we are unable to
   fully load test without real traffic. Next steps are to move Analytics o=
ver
   in a staged fashion, we=E2=80=99re aiming to do this in the time between=
 the next
   few caucuses/primaries to minimize disruption.


Outage:

   -

   Stripe outage: Beginning at 5:02 p.m. ET on 02/04/2016 Stripe began
   experiencing an uptick in the amount of time it takes for us to confirm =
a
   successful donations. This results in failed donations on our website. W=
e
   flipped over to our backup payment process, Cybersource, at 5:12 p.m. ET=
.
   We currently support one-time donations to our HFA account through
   Cybersource -- all other contribution methods (saved credit card,
   subscription, all HVF donations) -- were disabled. Stripe confirmed a
   recovery around 5:25 p.m. ET and we flipped back to Stripe at 5:27 p.m. =
ET.
   Quick Donate queueing (mentioned above) and upcoming support for HVF
   contributions in Cybersource will allow us to retain donations when Stri=
pe
   experiences outages.
   -

   Ops coverage update: As we continue through primary season things are
   only going to get crazier, so the tech ops team has been making rounds
   through our agile teams to make sure everyone has the support they need.=
 We
   now have a complete list of all of our production services and a better
   understanding of how we can help all of our developers keep things runni=
ng
   smoothly during busy times. Coming soon: new ways to contact our on-call
   engineers when you have a problem -- look for updates in your inbox this
   week!


Hiring:

   -

   Welcome Matt Tucker (Senior Software Engineer): Matt is our first
   backend engineer to join the Donate team. He will own building new servi=
ces
   that extend Groundwork=E2=80=99s functionality in order to continue to g=
row our
   online fundraising capabilities. Before joining HFA, Matt was co-founder=
 of
   Unfold, an iOS app for sharing, discovering and having conversations abo=
ut
   interesting stuff you find on the internet. Before Unfold, Matt was a Sr=
.
   Backend Engineer at charity: water where he helped build their crowdfund=
ing
   platform as well as critical internal systems.
   - Welcome James Plummer (Senior Product Designer): James will be working
   across two main product areas -- Fundraising and Organizing. On the
   Fundraising side, James will be partnering with Deepa and working with t=
he
   Donation agile team to build the highest converting donation (web or nat=
ive
   mobile) workflows ever seen on a political campaign. He'll also be apply=
ing
   that same design thinking to signup forms. On the Organizing side, James
   will be working with Gerard on tools to improve life for staff and
   leadership whether that means continuing to build out the Chrome Extensi=
on,
   expanding the power of the Raiser (aka Palmer) tool, or other upcoming
   "awesome organizer dopeness" (his words, not mine!).
