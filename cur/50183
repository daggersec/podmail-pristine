<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><u>The website team</u></b></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The team building the website itself is led by Dan R=

developer for President Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign, and Teddy Goff, Presiden=
t
Obama&#39;s Digital Director.=C2=A0 We are operating under the precautionar=

assumption that legally we cannot begin designing the visual part of the si=
te
until 4-5 weeks before you decide to announce an exploratory committee, sin=
ce
this would require contracting with designers (there&#39;s also a risk of
leaks).=C2=A0 So, the backend architecture is being built (and can be used =
by
any candidate should you not run), but what you can see on a screen and

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The features for the site will be a mix of off-the-s=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><u>Leadership</u></b></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">One of the reasons I think the CTO should be early i=
n the
hiring schedule is that the CTO should act as a guide on the technology
strategy as a whole and work with you and the campaign leadership at the
beginning to develop a true vision for the role tech will play and actual
projects the campaign should invest in.=C2=A0 It&#39;s important that the c=
ampaign
not embrace technology for its own sake, but rather be clear about a series=
 of
challenges technology needs to solve and what can realistically be
accomplished.=C2=A0 For example, we know right now that a volunteer should =
be
able to canvass door-to-door using their cell phone, that&#39;s a problem w=
e know
we can solve, but we would need to start solving it early next year so ther=
e&#39;s
time for it to be tested and used in the field. =C2=A0</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Experts like Eric will each have their points of vie=
w, which
are important and should be consulted via a tech steering committee, but it=
&#39;s
important to have someone firmly grounded in the realities of the campaign =
and the
end-user=E2=80=99s experience to guide the ultimate vision.=C2=A0 I would s=
uggest that
we discuss how to make the process of hiring the CTO as enriching as possib=
le
for all of us, from who we consult for prospects to perhaps asking the fina=

candidates to present their ideas so you can see different perspectives.=C2=

Regardless, I think this person should be seen as an early hire to bring so=

tions on a fantastic event in Pennsylvania.=C2=A0 I was on the phone with t=
he Wolff team for some DGA work and they couldn&#39;t have been more please=
d.=C2=A0 Obviously the press was fantastic as well!</div><div><br></div><di=
v>Two things I wanted to relay:</div><div><br></div><div>First, I hope the =
most recent binder was helpful.=C2=A0 I know there were A LOT of big and sm=
all issues in there, including an abitious schedule for interviews.=C2=A0 U=
nderstanding that everyone has incredibly busy schedules before Election Da=
y, I think it makes sense to push the interview timeline a bit later and sp=
end as much time as we need in November to align on the hiring process, as =
well as other key operational pieces like media and technology.=C2=A0 The h=
iring process should not be rushed, so if giving ourselves the time to disc=
uss and agree on a process delays things a week or two, so be it.=C2=A0</di=
v><div><br></div><div>Let me know if you agree and I can work with Cheryl t=
o ensure we have that time on the schedule in early November.</div><div><br=
></div>Second, I also understand that you wanted to know more about what&#3=
9;s happening on technology and the website, so below is a quick snapshot o=
f the state of play.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve also attached the memo that was in the =
most recent binder.=C2=A0 Feel free to call if you want to discuss this in =
more detail, or we can set up a conference call to discuss as a group.=C2=
=A0 This is an important aspect of planning, so by all means flag issues or=
 questions.<div><br></div><div><b><u>The big picture:=C2=A0</u></b></div><d=
iv>We are in the process of developing a website that can go up if you deci=
de to announce an exploratory committee.=C2=A0 The purpose of this site is =
to allow visitors to donate, sign up, and invite other people to the site v=
ia social media (this is the &quot;new&quot; feature).=C2=A0 All the featur=
es of this site will be fully tested and backed up.=C2=A0 A significantly e=
xpanded--and very different looking--website will go up when/if you officia=
lly launch your campaign, with many more features, some of them new.=C2=A0 =
This is all outlined in the attached memo.</div><div><div><br></div><div><b=
><u>Eric Schmidt&#39;s company &quot;Groundwork&quot;</u></b></div><div>Eri=
c has a small staff of about ten people in Brooklyn working on two key tool=
s for the web page, which are listed below. They would be great to have and=
 would help the site work better in the future, however we are fully prepar=
ed to move forward without them and have tested backups from the Obama camp=
aign ready to use at any time.=C2=A0</div><div>I deliberately told Eric&#39=
;s team that we need these tools by mid-November so we have plenty of time =
to test them.=C2=A0 As of this week, they still say they will meet that dea=
dline, but we should be remain cautious until the tools are complete and te=
sted.</div><div>These tools are:</div><div><br></div><div><u>1. Sign up fun=
ction:</u>=C2=A0this tool will allow us to more dynamically optimize sign u=
p pages in the future.=C2=A0 For example, we will be able to find out if si=
gn up page A is generates more sign ups than page B.</div><div><br></div><d=
iv><u>2. &quot;Quick donate&quot;:</u> this is the tool that allows us to s=
ave someone&#39;s credit card information so that any future donations can =
be made in one click.=C2=A0 This is obviously a huge revenue booster.</div>=
<div><br></div><div>Eric&#39;s team is NOT building a &quot;complete websit=
e&quot;, which I know he sometimes implies.=C2=A0 Speaking candidly, it&#39=
;s fantastic that Eric has devoted resources to creating these new tools an=
d it&#39;s resource a potential campaign can leverage, but we are in no way=
 depending on him and will consider anything his team delivers as &quot;gra=
vy&quot;.=C2=A0 His team may continue to build new tools well into next yea=
r and/or the campaign may choose to hire some of his staff, but this is all=
 up in the air and in no way integral to what your tech strategy should be.=
</div><div><br></div><div><b><u>The website team</u></b></div><div>The team=
 building the website itself is led by Dan Ryan, the developer for Presiden=
t Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign, and Teddy Goff, President Obama&#39;s Digital =
Director.=C2=A0 While official legal advice is pending, we are operating un=
der the assumption that we cannot begin designing the visual part of the si=
te until 4-5 weeks before you choose to announce an exploratory committee, =
since this would require contracting with designers (there&#39;s also a ris=
k of leaks).=C2=A0 So, the backend architecture is being built, but what yo=
u can see on a screen and interact with cannot start until a month before y=
our exploratory goes public.</div><div>The features for the site will be a =
mix of off-the-shelf tools from major web companies, as well as tested tool=
s used by the Obama campaign.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b><u>Leadersh=
ip</u></b></div><div>One of the reasons I put the CTO so early on the hirin=
g schedule is that the CTO should act as a guide on the technology strategy=
 as a whole and work with you and the campaign leadership right at the begi=
nning to develop a true vision for the role tech will play and actual proje=
cts the campaign should invest in.=C2=A0 It&#39;s important that the campai=
gn no embrace technology for its own sake, but rather be clear about a seri=
es of challenges technology needs to solve and what can realistically be ac=
complished.=C2=A0 For example, we know right now that a volunteer should be=
 able to canvass door-to-door using their cell phone, that&#39;s a problem =
we know we can solve, but we need to start solving it early next year so th=
ere&#39;s time for it to be tested and used in the field. =C2=A0</div><div>=
=C2=A0</div><div>Experts like Eric will each have their points of view, whi=
ch are going to be very important and should be consulted via a tech steeri=
ng committee, but it&#39;s important to have someone firmly grounded in the=
 realities of the campaign to guide the ultimate vision.=C2=A0 I would sugg=
est that we discuss how to make the process of hiring the CTO as enriching =
as possible for all of us, from who we consult for prospects to perhaps ask=
ing the final candidates to write out their ideas so you can see different =
perspectives.=C2=A0 Regardless, I think this person should be seen as an ea=
rly hire who can help bring some concrete thinking to the myriad of technol=
ogical possibilities. =C2=A0</div><div>Thinking through the process of hiri=
ng this person and who else you want to consult should be a priority action=
 item after the election.</div><div><br></div><div>I hope all of this is he=
lpful and don&#39;t hesitate to call with questions.=C2=A0 We can also set =
up a call for all of us to discuss this together.</div><div><br></div><div>=
Best,</div><div><br></div><div>Robby</div></div>
