Thanks. I can raise 2 with them tomorrow and if you all want to join tomorr=
ow, that would be great too.
Also note - Governor Padilla is scheduled to come to CGI next week and to p=
articipate in the "island energy issues" discussion. So might be a second o=
pportunity to raise #2 with him in a room full of folks who would give mora=
l support.
I know this probably is crazy talk - but do you think we should invite PRPP=
A head to the cgi island energy discussion? Would put them in a tight spot =
to be in that room and face all those folks and not agree to "do" something=
.

Two points I would push them on:

1)	If all they are going to do is prepare a report, I am not sure that gets=
 us anything.  PRPPA is fighting hard against any change at the moment and =
a report doesn't move the ball forward.  They need to use the report as a t=
ool to generate a call for action on some concrete steps, like a law requir=
ing PRPPA to meet specific targets with a timeline for the conversion to re=
newables.  They talk about some pretty specific goals but process of making=
 them happen is critical and its not clear from the memo how that will occu=
r.  The key challenge they face is not figuring out what they need to do bu=
t figuring out how to get it done.

2) 	The Culebra idea is interesting.  In the past the previous Governor has=
 called for making Vieques energy independent.  Working on these two island=
s is something the foundation might want to explore as a joint project with=
 the Government and PRPPA.  Because of WJC's history with Vieques, it also =
gives us a hook.  This would require a meeting between someone with the Fou=
ndation, PRPPA and the Governor.  Don't know if they would agree but would =
be big if they did and would show the rest of PR that it can be done.  PRPP=
A may have a lobbyist in DC and it might be easier to make the deal up here=
 than down there where everything is so polarized.

Dear Mr. Desai:
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing on behalf of Mrs. Ingrid M=
. Vila-Biaggi, Chief of Staff for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This ema=
il is to follow up on President Clinton's visit to San Juan last July, and =
to express our interest on establishing continued cooperation with you on c=
ertain issues paramount for the development of Puerto Rico.
Governor Garc=EDa-Padilla's administration goals on economic development, h=
ealth and climate change -to mention just a few- are well aligned with thos=
e of the Clinton Foundation and we believe that there are many spaces of co=
llaboration that can be built from his last visit. I am copying Dr. Efra=ED=
n O'Neill, who is the Governor's Senior Advisor on Energy Affairs.
We look forward to hear from you soon so we can begin this dialogue.
