John--

It's been almost a year since I lost my job at Sensata Technologies in =
Freeport, Illinois.

When it was announced that 170 American jobs at my plant would be sent to =
China, including my own, I felt so betrayed and disappointed. But I didn't =
want to give up. After all, I'd worked at the Sensata factory for 33 =
years.

That's when I decided to go to a meeting to speak with my Congressman, =
Bobby Schilling, to try to keep my job in Illinois where it belonged.

When I got there, however, it was clear that Mr. Schilling wanted nothing =
to do with the Sensata workers who were losing their jobs. When we asked =
him if he'd support legislation to keep jobs in the United States, he =
responded by ignoring us and walking out of the room. See it for yourself:

No American should have to face the devastating news that their job has =
been outsourced to another country. A living-wage job is hard to come by =
these days. We need our elected representatives to help keep these jobs at =
home. Will you join me in calling on Congress to help keep American jobs =
in America?

the outsourcing of American jobs >>=20

Almost a year later, I'm still struggling to get back on my feet. I don't =
want any more Americans to have to go through what I went through.

Please, help me make that a reality. Sign your name now:
