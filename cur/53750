Friend,

I'm Jeremy Bird. I oversaw the Obama for America field
program, so you might have gotten an email or two (or a
hundred) from me if you helped reelect the President last
year.

I promise I have a really good reason for being back in your
inbox.

In 52 days, Virginians will pick their next governor. And
who they choose is entirely up to us.

If people like you and me put in the time -- knocking doors,
making calls, and having conversations about what's on the
line in November -- Terry McAuliffe will come out on top. If
we don't, he could fall short.

Terry's campaign's holding a Weekend of Action on September
21 and 22. Will you join in from home by making calls to
Virginia voters that need to hear from the campaign?

Yes, I'd like to make calls on Saturday, September 21 or=20
Sunday, September 22.

http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/call-from-home-bird

I can't do it next weekend, but want to make calls before
Election Day.

http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/bird-call-from-home

If I learned one thing from last year's election, it's that
there's nothing more influential than a one-on-one
conversation about the power of your vote.

Those conversations can turn apathy into support, and
support into excitement. They let people know there's an
election happening and how to take part.

But we have a whole lot of those conversations left to have,
and less than two months to have them in.

That's why I'm in -- recruiting volunteers and anything else
I can do to lend a hand.

And it's why I'm counting on you to join me and we made it
so easy. Sign up to make calls from home during the Weekend
of Action:

http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/call-from-home-bird

Let's do this,

Jeremy Bird
