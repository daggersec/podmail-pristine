John --

Over the next two months, Organizing for America volunteers like you will =
talk to millions of voters about what's at stake this fall.

Our Vote 2010 goals are ambitious -- but meeting them is the only way =
President Obama will be able to continue moving our country forward with =
strong allies in Congress.

We know these one-on-one conversations are incredibly effective. In 2008, =
volunteers like you turned out millions of voters -- many for the first =
time. And in our increasingly fractured digital environment -- when so =
much competes for our time and attention -- conversations between friends, =
family members, and neighbors remain the most trusted and impactful method =
of political persuasion.

I have a tremendous amount of confidence in this strategy -- and you -- =
because I saw how it changed politics in 2008. You connected personally =
with more voters than any campaign in history -- and we won.

This year, the strategy is the same.

That's why we've put together resources to guide you in your conversations =
with voters this fall. It's time to get back out there and deliver our =
message again.

Check out these resources and gear up for election season:

http://my.barackobama.com/StartHere5

Now and over the next 51 days, President Obama is forcefully taking on the =
Republicans and making this case to voters in cities across the country.

But he can't deliver this message alone.

Republicans are desperately trying to take over Congress by threatening to =
repeal the historic changes we've achieved together. That's it. Even if =
they weren't funded largely by special interests, theirs would be one of =
the most cynical campaigns I've seen in my decades of working in politics.

We know what Republicans will do if they win back control. Their ideas -- =
out of touch and favoring special interests -- reveal not only an =
astonishing lack of understanding of the challenges facing middle-class =
families, but a party that can define itself only in its united opposition =
to progress. Returning to Bush administration policies that drove our =
economy into a recession is not leadership -- it's negligence.

Over the last year and a half, President Obama and Democrats in Congress =
have stabilized our financial system, ended insurance company abuses, =
invested in private sector jobs, cut taxes for middle-class families, and =
established the strongest consumer financial protections in history.

Republicans stood on the sidelines and said "no."

A party that refuses to participate in tackling the enormous challenges =
facing our country does not deserve to lead.

You know this. I know this. Now let's get out there and tell our =
communities.

Please print out these resources for your reference this fall:

http://my.barackobama.com/StartHere5

Thanks,

David Plouffe

P.S. -- Exciting news: This month and next, we're holding five major =
Moving America Forward Organizing Rallies with President Obama in =
Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Nevada, and a special Commit to Vote =
Tele-Town Hall. Click here for more details: =
