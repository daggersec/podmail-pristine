After much back and forth, he's decided to help out the education and
energy working groups, sort of as a "wise man/advisor."  I think it's a
role that suits his background, and minimizes his time commitment, since
he's going to be traveling for the campaign.  But he asked me to raise
two things:  1) he's going to be in D.C. this Friday and would like to
meet with you; and 2) he'd like to join the transition board and if
that's not possible, he'd like some kind of formal title with the
transition.  Regarding the second point, I told him we likely weren't
adding anyone to the board, but if it would help, we could call him a
"senior advisor" to the Obama Transition Project.  (This whole thing
begs the question of why he needs a title when we're not even supposed
to talk about our transition work.)  Let me know what you think.
