John/Melody:

Got a series of urgent calls today from Bill Taylor.  We didn't hook up but=
 message I got was he was talking to you and Melody last spring about offic=
e space at CAP.  We don't currently have private office space available.  T=
here may be are a few spots at 1225 I Street if we don't end up getting Gen=
e's Universal Education Project bequeathed to CAP or if NSN goes belly up (=
which might happen).  (There are currently a bunch of Pods over there but a=
ssume he needs private office.)

I am just making sure we did not make any commitment.  I know of Bill and h=
is many accomplishments, but this wouldn't be a priority for me unless you =
need it to be.

Thanks

Sarah
