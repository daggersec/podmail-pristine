Dear friends,

As you've likely heard, on Sunday Missouri Congressman Todd Akin (and
candidate for the U.S. Senate) made highly inflammatory remarks when
discussing rapes that result in conceptions. Akin said:

"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut
that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or
something, I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment
ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child."

Progress Missouri,=A0with American Bridge 21st Century's tracker
report in hand, immediately pounced to mobilize in-state allies and
influence opinion makers. Our Missouri affiliate immediately posted
and separately distributed video, to have a second track of data and
reaction, echoing the national stories and condemnation.

Progress Missouri immediately pushed this breaking story full throttle
via email lists to reporters, political insiders, opinion makers, our
full membership list in the Show-Me State and on numerous social media
platforms. Progress Missouri also played an aggressive online
quarterbacking role, amplifying conservative and independent reactions
to Akin's comments.

Reaction to Akin's comments in Missouri and national media has
shamed the GOP from coast to coast and led to many Republicans calling
for Akin to step down. Despite being disavowed by fellow candidates
and Republican Party leadership, Rep. Akin vows to remain in the U.S.
Senate race. Progress Missouri won't be asking Akin to drop out, but
they will continue to use this issue to aggressively highlight how
Todd Akin's out of touch thoughts and policies would influence the
lives of Missourians.

This is a great example of the rapid response work we'll
continue to do, to make sure that the issues of working people rise to
the national stage, in each of our 21 states during 2012, 2013, 2014
and beyond. We hope you appreciate this update from the mid-western
front, and as always, please let us know what you think. You can also
donate to ProgressNow to fight on behalf of all Americans -- including
women who want the freedom to choose what happens to their own bodies.
