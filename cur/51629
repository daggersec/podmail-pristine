One thought:  Mike McCabe for the energy/enviro personnel job.  Very, =
very close to BIden; former deputy at EPA; no interest in a job; =
confined to a wheelchair because of MS.  All around decent, professional =
guy.  Gets politics -- worked for Biden for a number of years.  Gets =
agencies.

Question:  where are things with Jason?

Thanks
