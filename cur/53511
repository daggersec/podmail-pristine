New York Post: Foe narrows gap with Gilly
By Brendan Scott
Last Updated: 5:39 AM, September 22, 2010

ALBANY -- Kirsten Gillibrand may have a fight on her hands after all

Little-known Republican Joe DioGuardi has closed within striking distance of New York's junior senator since winning the GOP nomination last week, according to a statewide poll released yesterday.

Rasmussen Reports found that the former Westchester congressman trails the sitting Democratic senator by a mere 10 points among likely voters, 39-49 percent. DioGuardi has cut the gap in half since before the primary, when a similar poll found him trailing Gillibrand, 31-51 percent.

"It's going to get even closer once people see who Joe DioGuardi is, what his motivation is," he told The Post.

"If you know who I am, then you know that Gillibrand is toast. She cannot win this election."

DioGuardi -- a staunch abortion opponent -- supports a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and providing  every American with a "credit statement" to show them the nation's debt balance.
