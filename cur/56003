Sounds good. Thanks for sharing your thinking. Keep us posted after the
meeting. Maya and Amanda Renteria are the points and I'll help on policy
front. Looping in Amanda so she is aware.

I guess I don't understand your view here.  Home health is a lot of money.
SEIU generally tries to get more money into the sector. So they would
generally like big investments here.  Now they pushed hard for ltc in ACA
and it collapsed so they are chastised and they don't have a specific ask
at the moment.  But as with almost any interest group, there's a risk of
some kind of big ask.  I assumed the more you keep their requests indirect
the better you are.  So I kind of thought this was optimal for you.
Therefore I'm not understanding why you want to meet with them even down
the road when they are not asking.

I think Mary Kay is basically trying to limit the expectations of this side
of her house without ignoring them. Like if they push me I can obviously be
more separate.

Anyway, perhaps I'm overthinking it but those were my assumptions.
