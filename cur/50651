Like many of my people - he sees things a bit as transactions.

I had lunch with him on Friday.  He's interested in helping CAP and will
likely do $25k - which is what he does for like every think tank in
Washington.

He also talked about some kind of business council for Hillary - it was a
little unclear if was LGBT exclusively or not (how he's involved with LGBT
is a little bit beyond me, as he made clear he's not gay).  Anyway, he
thinks he can raise $5 m for Hillary off some idea in this space.  He's
very keen to speak with you about it.

It seemed relatively clear to me that the first item is connected w/ the
second item in his mind.  His idea is probably worth a call, but only do
what makes sense for you guys.

Let me know - thanks!

Neera
