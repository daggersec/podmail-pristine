Evidence Arizona Immigration Law May Be Fatal Mistake  for GOP=20
There is compelling new evidence that Republicans will rue the day that =20
they allowed their virulent anti-immigrant wing to grab the controls of the=
 =20
Republican Party.=20
In fact, contrary to much of the pundit chatter, a drama is playing out =20
this fall that may doom Republicans to permanent minority status in  Americ=
a.=20
The passage of the Arizona =93papers, please=94 anti-immigration law  has=
=20
forced Republican politicians around the country into a political box canyo=
n =20
that does not offer an easy escape.   For fear of offending the emergent Te=
a=20
Party =96 and other anti-immigrant  zealots in their own base -- they are=
=20
precipitating a massive realignment of  Latino voters nationwide.=20
According to data released by Public Policy Polling (PPP), Texas Governor =
=20
Rick Perry has lost his early lead over Democratic challenger Bill White an=
d=20
the  race is now tied.  The movement from  a previous PPP poll in February=
=20
comes entirely from Hispanic voters.  PPP reports that:=20
=93With white voters Perry led 54-36 then and  leads 55-35 now. With black=
=20
voters White led 81-12 then and 70 -7 now.  But with Hispanics Perry has go=
ne=20
from  leading 53-41 to trailing 55-21=85.there is no doubt the (Arizona)=20
immigration bill  is popular nationally. But if it causes Hispanics to chan=
ge=20
their voting  behavior without a parallel shift among whites then it=92s go=
ing to=20
end up playing  to Democratic advantage this fall.=94=20
The punditry sometimes forgets that in politics intensity is often just  as=
=20
important as poll percentages.  For many Hispanic voters, the Arizona=20
immigration law is an insult.  It is an attack on their very  identity.  An=
d it=20
is certainly a  litmus test that tells a Hispanic voter whether or not a=20
political candidate is  on their side =96 the critical threshold test of vo=
ter=20
decision  making.=20
The same is simply not true for non-Hispanic voters.  As a result, by=20
allowing the Party to be  defined by the anti-immigrant zealots =96 and ref=
using to=20
lift a finger to pass  comprehensive immigration reform in Congress =96 the=
=20
Republicans are playing with  political fire.  =20
In fact, given the fact that Hispanics are the fastest-growing segment of =
=20
the American electorate, the Republicans are playing with permanent=20
marginality. =20
As if to sharpen their anti-immigrant brand, last week the Texas =20
Republican State Convention voted for a platform that included a plank call=
ing  on=20
the state government to adopt a state law like the one in Arizona.  =20
But Texas is far from the only place where the  emerging Latino backlash is=
=20
in evidence.  PPP reports that its latest polls in Colorado show that=20
incumbent Democratic  Senator Michael Bennett has gone from tying his oppon=
ent=20
Republican Jane Norton  to a three-point lead largely because his lead amon=
g=20
Hispanic voters has soared  from 12 to 21 points. =20
California Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman felt compelled =
=20
to back tough anti-immigrant measures to get the Republican nomination.  No=
w=20
her support among Latinos is  hemorrhaging, dropping from 35 to 26 points=
=20
from March to May.  Since the primary, Whitman has begun to  waffle on her=
=20
tough anti-immigrant stand but the damage has been done =96 what=92s  more,=
 it=92s=20
memorialized in videos that Democrat Jerry Brown is sure to loop over  and=
=20
over on Spanish language TV.  =20
Even in districts where the Hispanic vote is not large, big declines in =20
Republican support could prove decisive in otherwise close races.  After al=
l=20
the difference between getting  49.9% and 51.1% means everything in an=20
election.=20
The bottom line is that by passing the Arizona =93papers, please=94 law,=20
Republicans =96  especially in the West =96 have awakened a sleeping and gr=
owing=20
giant.  =20
Remember that the huge drops in Hispanic support for Republicans do not =20
factor in the effect the Arizona law will have on Hispanic  turnout.=20
A few months ago, no one would have predicted a massive turnout in =20
November among Hispanic voters.  That appears to have changed.  =20
If a surge of anti-Republican Hispanic voters destroys the careers of =20
enough politicians who thought that pandering to anti-immigrant fear was go=
od =20
politics, the whole political narrative about immigration reform will chang=
e.=20
=20
Watch for big sections of the Republican establishment to fall all over =20
themselves to make amends to the rising tide of Latino voters, soon after t=
he =20
elections.  But in all likelihood it  will be very difficult to get the=20
anti-immigrant toothpaste back into the  tube.=20
If it continues to pursue  its current course, the Republican Party may=20
find that it loses another ethnic  minority the same way it lost African=20
Americans two generations ago. African  Americans recall, were a solid part=
 of the=20
Republican base from the Civil War  through the early part of the 20th=20
Century.  Roosevelt=92s New Deal began to change that.  The civil rights=20
revolution and the  Republican =93Southern Strategy=94 completed  it.   Now=
 92% to 95%=20
of  African Americans vote Democratic. The problem is that you can only get=
=20
shut out  of a couple of minorities and before you know it, you are no long=
er=20
competitive  with the majority of Americans. =20
Within just a few years minorities will become a majority of the American =
=20
electorate.  And let=92s remember that  Republicans are also having enormou=
s=20
difficulty competing for young white  millennial voters that are forming=20
their voting habits at this moment.  That may very well mean that the  deci=
sion=20
to write off Hispanics may turn out to be a fatal error for the future  of=
=20
Republicans as a national party.  Hispanic voters could have been a politic=
al=20
lifeboat for Republicans.  No longer.=20
And of course the irony is that some of the more enlightened elements of =
=20
the Republican Party =96 who have justified risking long-term popularity wi=
th =20
Hispanics in exchange for short-term political gains =96 may not even see=
=20
benefits  in the short run.=20
For some years, Latino immigration rights marchers have carried signs =20
reading: =93Today We March, Tomorrow We Vote.=94  Tomorrow may have arrived=
. =20
Robert Creamer is a long-time  political organizer and strategist, and=20
