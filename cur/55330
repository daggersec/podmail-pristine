Just two VMs. First was from Robby at 10:30 am today before you came in to
the office (said nothing in the message). Second was from someone with the
last name Brody. I couldn't make out his first name, but I assume you'll
know who he is from the message context.

*?? Brody: *
These guys are headed to the convention this weekend. Close to 6,000
doctors at the convention. Wants to have a call with the two principles
before the convention followed by a meeting. Would love to get on the phone
tomorrow or later tonight to make the introduction and keep them in the
game.
Call back: (202) 351-1619
