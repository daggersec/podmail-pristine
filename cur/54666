John --

The Senate just passed Wall Street reform. The bill will become law the =
moment President Obama signs it.

This reform represents the boldest financial regulations since the =
aftermath of the Great Depression -- and the strongest consumer =
protections in history.

Every door you knocked in Iowa, every phone call you made in Ohio, every =
dollar you dug deep to give -- it's all for this. The Recovery Act, health =
reform, and now Wall Street reform, on top of everything else. In a year =
and a half, this administration has made bigger, bolder progress than any =
president's in decades.

We have a president who fights for all of us, every day. We have you, the =
best organizers this country has ever seen, who flooded Congress with =
calls and letters, had millions of conversations with friends and =
neighbors, went toe-to-toe with the country's most powerful special =
interests -- and won.

And we have members of Congress who bravely stood with the President, even =
as right-wing groups have pledged $200 million to defeat them in =
November's elections.

First, take a moment to celebrate. This is an achievement that will make =
American lives better and protect our economy for generations to come, and =
it absolutely wouldn't have happened without you.

Then, take a moment to thank the members of Congress who stood with us and =
supported these landmark reforms. In the coming days, they'll be taking a =
lot of heat for defying Wall Street -- and they need to know they have our =
gratitude:

http://my.barackobama.com/WSRVictory8

Organizing for America supporters are signing a note of thanks to Nancy =
Pelosi, Harry Reid, and all of the allies in Congress who stood up for =
reform.

Will you add your name?

http://my.barackobama.com/WSRVictory8

We'll deliver these signatures to leaders in Congress who supported =
reform, after the President signs this into law.

Thanks for all you did to get us here. I'm so grateful to be making =
history with you, and I know the President is as well.

Mitch
