That would be great! Who would be the most effective campaign surrogate to
join for this call?  Would it be helpful to have a senior women campaign
official? Perhaps Maya Harris who leads our policy team with Jake?

Dennis and Gary,

Just wanted to let you know that we are making great progress on our new
Affiliate Membership class.  We have already begun inviting our list to
join, should be able to provide a strong audience for you guys in about 30
days.

As I mentioned last month, more than half the business leaders on our list
are women.  We=E2=80=99ve found that it works best to organize calls on gen=
eral
business issues, like access to capital, rather than to focus on =E2=80=9Cw=
omen=E2=80=99s=E2=80=9D
issues, like family leave or child care.

We=E2=80=99d very much like to organize business leader calls with you, and
women-only call might be a nice way to start.  Again, we hope to have
critical mass for our Affiliate Membership in October.

Thanks

Jim

We're launching Women for Hillary.
Jim --

The GOP candidates for president have some of the most extreme views on
women's health and rights that I've ever seen -- and trust me, I've become
something of an expert on their views on women's rights.

We need to make sure not one of them becomes president. The way we do that
is by reaching out to as many women as we can and getting them involved in
the community of this campaign.



*Today, I'm asking you to help me do that. Send this link to a few of the
women in your life and ask them to join Women for Hillary (or join
yourself): https://www.hillaryclinton.com/women-for-hillary/
