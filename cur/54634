John--

Last year, 170 good-paying jobs were shipped from Freeport, Illinois to =
China.

The workers were employed by Sensata Technologies -- a subsidiary of the =
now infamous Bain Capital.

Faced with some of the most devastating news of their lives, a few of the =
employees decided to turn to the one person they thought could help them: =
their Congressman, Bobby Schilling.

On September 18, 2012, at a meeting with constituents, Sensata employees =
asked Mr. Schilling about his vote against a bill that would keep jobs =
here in America. Mr. Schilling's response? He turned his back and walked =
out.

As your Congresswoman, I pledge to never turn my back on workers. In fact, =
I'm fighting every day to keep jobs in America and bring more =
opportunities to Illinois. I hope you'll join me.

John, will you click this personalized link and sign your name in support =
of keeping American jobs at home >>
