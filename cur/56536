Attached and pasted below is the prepared text of a speech on trade that I =
gave at a Brookings event this morning. The major focus of the remarks is o=
n what I believe to be an underappreciated, but potentially even more impor=
tant, contribution of expanded trade: increasing innovation and thus econom=
ic growth. It also addresses the secular stagnation and global savings glut=
 debate, pointing out that trade liberalization offers important economic b=
enefits that helps to address either concern.

Trade, Innovation, and Economic Growth

Remarks by Jason Furman
Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers

The Brookings Institution
April 8, 2015

As prepared for delivery

It is great to be back at Brookings, an institution I fondly called my home=
 before joining the Obama Administration. Brookings has long played an impo=
rtant role in the development, discussion, and advancement of economic poli=
cies and I expect no less from today's forum.

One of the main goals of economic policy is to raise the incomes of middle-=
class households and those working to get into the middle class. A necessar=
y-but certainly not sufficient-condition for sustained increases in incomes=
 is stronger economic growth. Indeed, the recovery has accelerated in recen=
t years: our economy grew 2.8 percent over the past two years, compared wit=
h 2.1 percent over the first three-and-a-half years of the recovery, while =
the labor market is in the midst of the longest stretch of monthly job grow=
th on record.

But the longer-run income trends are more troubling. In the post-war years,=
 middle-class households enjoyed annual income growth of about 3 percent pe=
r year. Since the 1970s, however, income growth has fallen to about half a =
percent a year. The largest cause of this slowdown has been a slower produc=
tivity growth. Rising inequality and, more recently, declining labor force =
participation rates, have also played important roles.

In my remarks today, I will focus on one key instrument that can help boost=
 middle-class incomes: expanding trade. The policies here include regional =
agreements, specifically the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transa=
tlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP)- trade agreements that tie=
 together two-thirds of the world economy. They also include multilateral e=
fforts through the World Trade Organization (WTO), including the WTO Inform=
ation Technology Agreement, the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, the Trade=
 in Services Agreement, and the Environmental Goods Agreement.

First, I will briefly outline the conventional economic arguments for the w=
ays these agreements can benefit middle-class families, both by improving t=
he quality of jobs and by expanding choice for consumers and producers. Sec=
ond, the major focus of my remarks will be on what I believe to be an under=
appreciated-but perhaps even more important-contribution of expanded trade:=
 increasing innovation and thus economic growth. Third, I will briefly cons=
ider how the more level playing field created by our proposed trade agreeme=
nts increases the returns to complementary policies designed to help expand=
 the U.S. economy and benefit U.S. workers. Finally, I will offer some thou=
ghts about how our international efforts, particularly in the trade area, r=
elate to some of the current debates over secular stagnation and global imb=
alances.


The Traditional Case for Trade: Comparative Advantage and its Implications =
for Household Incomes

The traditional case for trade is based on an exercise in comparative stati=
cs: comparing the allocation of production and consumption in autarky (or w=
ith trade barriers) to what it would be under free trade (or with reduced t=
rade barriers). Adam Smith was one of the first to frame the problem and so=
me of the earliest analytics were developed by David Ricardo in his theory =
of comparative advantage-the idea that countries should specialize in and e=
xport to other countries what they produce relatively efficiently, and impo=
rt from other countries what they produce relatively inefficiently.

In the nearly 200 years since Ricardo published his ideas, economists have =
identified a number of further benefits to trade that fit within this compa=
rative statics paradigm. First, the ability to sell to a larger world marke=
t allows firms to take better advantage of increasing returns to scale. Sec=
ond, much of the expansion in trade is along the "extensive margin," so red=
uced tariffs do not merely increase trade in currently traded products, but=
 also open up trading opportunities for new firms and new products. And thi=
rd, foreign direct investment is especially important for improving overall=
 productive efficiency.

Together these different economic forces translate into two very simple ben=
efits for the middle-class: better jobs and improved living standards. Stud=
ies of U.S. manufacturing industries document that, on average, export-inte=
nsive industries pay workers up to 18 percent more than non-export-intensiv=
e industries. Extensive economic research shows higher average wages in exp=
orting firms, possibly because those firms are more productive and thus hav=
e higher profits, or because they seek out skilled workers to produce high-=
quality goods. When controlling for industry and worker characteristics, CE=
A finds that the average industry's strong increase in exports over the 199=
0s and 2000s translated into an additional $1,300 in annual earnings for th=
e typical worker. That corresponds to more than two months' worth of an ave=
rage family's food spending. As a result, increased exports are one route t=
o higher middle-class wages.

Higher living standards result because trade allows countries to specialize=
 in their comparatively productive lines of business. When our trading part=
ners produce goods relatively more efficiently, the United States can impor=
t goods at lower prices than if we were to use our scarce resources to prod=
uce those goods ourselves. These lower prices raise real wages, helping U.S=
. consumers purchase more with their current incomes. International trade a=
lso offers consumers a wider range of products to choose from-from year-rou=
nd fresh fruit to affordable clothing-offering value equivalent to 2.6 perc=
ent of GDP by one estimate. The greater variety of imports available at low=
er prices also reduces firms' production costs through imported intermediat=
e inputs, thereby helping American businesses to expand production and empl=
oyment and increase the wages they can afford to pay. Since World War II, r=
eductions in U.S. tariffs are estimated to have contributed an additional 7=
.3 percent to American incomes.

One of the next critical efforts in liberalizing trade and opening foreign =
markets is TPP, an agreement we are negotiating with 11 other countries tha=
t together with the United States represent nearly 40 percent of the global=
 economy.

The starting point of TPP is the contrast between U.S. tariffs and those of=
 our partner countries. Our trade-weighted average applied tariff rate is 1=
.4 percent and 70 percent of imports already enter our economy duty free. I=
n contrast, on average, our TPP partners report simple average applied tari=
ffs 1.5 percentage points higher than our equivalent rate. In some TPP coun=
tries, average tariffs are up to 4 percentage points higher, though this di=
fference masks considerable industry-specific variation; the United States =
faces tariffs of up to 30 percent on auto exports to Malaysia and 40 percen=
t on agricultural goods to Vietnam. Many TPP countries also have substantia=
lly higher non-tariff barriers, particularly in the area of services trade,=
 where the United States maintains a strong comparative advantage. As a res=
ult, TPP will disproportionately decrease foreign barriers to U.S. exports.=
 In addition, TPP will include the highest and most enforceable labor and e=
nvironmental standards of any trade agreement and will be the first trade a=
greement to put disciplines on state-owned enterprises and to ensure a free=
 and open internet.

The most comprehensive estimates of the benefits of TPP are those of Peter =
Petri, Michael Plummer, and Fan Zhai, who employ an 18-sector, 24-region co=
mputable general equilibrium model to simulate policy changes in more than =
twenty different areas including tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and rules go=
verning foreign direct investment. They find that by 2025, TPP would raise =
U.S. incomes by 0.4 percent per year, the equivalent of $77 billion in 2007=
 dollars, although the actual estimate could vary somewhat depending on the=
 details of the agreement and alternative modelling assumptions. The Europe=
an Union has said that the United States would gain a comparable amount fro=
m T-TIP. Some have described these totals as small, but I think I would ris=
k losing my license to offer economic advice if I counseled anyone to leave=
 $77 billion lying on the sidewalk each year.


The New Case for Trade: Expanding Competition, Innovation, and Economic Gro=
wth

But these estimates may understate-perhaps even grossly understate-the bene=
fits of TPP, T-TIP, and expanded trade more generally. All of these estimat=
es are essentially based on comparative statics. But as Petri, Plummer and =
Zhai were the first to point out, "[e]conomic integration may have large ad=
ditional benefits that are not adequately captured by microeconomic models"=
 because these models do not incorporate the effects of trade on the rate o=
f innovation and thus the rate of economic growth. Or in the words of Nobel=
 Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, "[r]elatively free trade has the adv=
antage that the possibility of increasing market share in world markets is =
a constant incentive for innovative activity."

Thanks to the pioneering work of Solow himself more than a half century ago=
, economists understand innovation in terms of total factor productivity-th=
e total amount of output that can be produced from a given amount of inputs=
 like capital and labor. In what follows, I explore two ways in which trade=
 can increase total factor productivity: as a direct input into the innovat=
ion production function and as an increased incentive to innovate.

Trade and the Innovation Production Function

We can think of innovation as being produced by a production function that =
combines inputs like research and development (R&D). Trade can directly inc=
rease the level of innovation for a given amount of inputs. Specifically:

Greater R&D specialization can increase innovation. The static arguments ab=
out comparative advantage can be extended to R&D and innovation itself. Gre=
ater specialization can increase the amount of knowledge produced per unit =
of R&D investment if companies in different countries focus on innovating i=
n the areas where they have a comparative advantage. For example, if engine=
ers at Toshiba focus on improving memory chips, and engineers at Intel focu=
s on improving microprocessors, the R&D productivity of each firm may be hi=
gher, leading to better and cheaper computers than if each company had to i=
mprove both components simultaneously.

One study of R&D specialization shows that strengthening foreign intellectu=
al property protection, as TPP would do, leads to more outward licensing fr=
om the United States, where U.S. companies allow other companies to use the=
ir ideas, products, or processes in exchange for royalty payments. Specific=
ally, the authors find that royalty payments from foreign affiliates to U.S=
. parent companies increase by 16.6 percent on average following a reform t=
hat strengthens intellectual property rights in the affiliates' home countr=
y. This finding highlights the role of non-tariff barriers for shaping trad=
e in ideas, particularly if one country specializes in the "R" and the othe=
r in the "D."

Trade also helps firms become more productive by accelerating the global fl=
ow of ideas. Both exporters and importers are frequently exposed to new ide=
as and novel tools, materials, or techniques that make them more productive=
. For example, many multinational companies have systems and standards to p=
romote the diffusion of "best practices" within their global supply chains.=
 Learning also occurs when a firm adapts novel ideas to suit its own operat=
ing environment, leading to both new goods and greater productivity. For ex=
ample, many American manufacturers and businesses in other industries have =
adopted aspects of the "lean" production system, which was originally devel=
oped in Japan, and realized substantial productivity benefits by tailoring =
the underlying ideas to meet their own needs.

In addition, export activity offers firms opportunities to learn about fore=
ign markets-perhaps even gaining technical expertise from foreign buyers-le=
ading to increased productivity. This "learning-by-exporting" theory has su=
pport in a body of research spanning many countries and time periods.

Many of the new ideas that diffuse through trade are embodied in intermedia=
te inputs. In fact, roughly half of all U.S. imports are inputs into the pr=
oduction of final goods. As noted earlier, increases in the quality and var=
iety of these inputs can reduce domestic firms' production costs, thereby i=
nducing American importers to expand production and employment. For example=
, a classic paper shows that a country's gains from international trade inc=
rease substantially when the benefits of cheaper and more varied imported p=
roduction inputs are taken into account.

Trade and the Incentive to Innovate

So far, I have discussed two ways that trade can make the innovation proces=
s more efficient. Trade can also boost productivity growth by increasing th=
e incentive to innovate.

For example, Solow has highlighted the link between market size and innovat=
ion. International trade allows companies to access a larger market, which =
yields more profit for a given level of innovation, and therefore raises th=
e incentive to innovate. For example, the global reach of the "App Stores" =
managed by Apple and Google contributes to the large number of software dev=
elopers who populate those distribution platforms. One recent study found e=
mpirical evidence of learning-by-exporting among low-productivity plants. A=
nother study finds that firms with experience in foreign markets have a gre=
ater probability of R&D investment, consistent with the idea that accessing=
 larger foreign markets translates into higher expected returns to research=
 and development.

Finally, even holding market size constant, increased trade can promote inn=
ovation by strengthening competition. More than fifty years ago, the Nobel =
Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow pointed out that a monopolist may hav=
e relatively weak incentives to innovate, because its innovations do not al=
low it to "steal" business from competitors. A similar idea appears in more=
 recent "Schumpeterian" models of innovation and economic growth, where com=
petition can promote growth by increasing the expected payoffs of successfu=
l innovation. By bringing companies into a worldwide marketplace, trade gre=
atly increases the incentive for a firm to innovate in order to win busines=
s from its competitors, reinforcing the market-size effects discussed above=
.

However, Schumpeterian models also suggest that too much competition can re=
duce innovation, because firms will not wish to invest in R&D if their disc=
overies are easily copied and the resulting profits immediately dissipated.=
 Intellectual property laws help determine where a country falls on the Sch=
umpeterian spectrum between too little and too much competition, and our tr=
ade policies can promote harmonization around a set of rules that strike th=
e appropriate balance for promoting long-run growth and job creation.

Does Trade Cause Innovation or Does Innovation Cause Trade?

While my comments have emphasized how trade can promote innovation and prod=
uctivity growth, it is important to note that this relationship runs in bot=
h directions. That is, increased trade can promote innovation, and at the s=
ame time, increased innovation can promote trade. At the individual firm le=
vel, the decision to innovate and the decision to trade are jointly determi=
ned as part of a comprehensive investment strategy. This creates interestin=
g challenges and opportunities for economic research that aims to isolate t=
he causal effects of a particular mechanism. The message for policy is simp=
ler, as one recent review of the evidence calls the relationship between tr=
ade and productivity growth a "robust finding"-trade is one of several tool=
s that we can use to promote long-term growth in productivity and middle-cl=
ass incomes.


Increasing the Return to Policies that Complement Expanded Trade

I have described the many opportunities offered by trade to create good new=
 jobs, benefit consumers, and expand innovation and growth. However, global=
ization, like any other domestic source of innovation, can also create chal=
lenges. Globalization has played a role in the increase in inequality, alth=
ough most economists would rank it below factors like technology, education=
, and labor market institutions. Globalization can also lead to increased t=
urnover and dislocation-although the dislocation due to trade is only a sma=
ll fraction of the dislocation in the economy in any given month, and much =
of the turnover generated by trade can be seen in the shift to more high-qu=
ality jobs.

But these challenges are real and merit a serious policy response. Part of =
this policy response lies in the observation that many of the downsides of =
globalization stem from factors outside of trade policy-factors like improv=
ements in transportation and information technologies which have driven the=
 recent rise in world trade. This perspective suggests that the importance =
of TPP is to ensure that we are managing the process of globalization, for =
example by incorporating stronger labor and environmental standards than we=
 would have in the absence of these agreements. But this perspective also u=
nderscores the importance of policies to complement expanded trade.

The Administration would be seeking more investment in infrastructure, rese=
arch and education as well as reforms to our business tax system regardless=
 of our position in the global economy. But greater global integration can =
increase the returns to all of these policies by expanding the size of mark=
ets, attracting foreign businesses to invest in the United States, and offe=
ring better employment opportunities. For example, as I said earlier, the u=
nconditional labor premium in export-intensive jobs is 18 percent over non =
export-intensive jobs. But this comparison is between unconditional means-a=
mong other factors, it reflects the fact that workers in export-intensive i=
ndustries are better educated and specially trained. This suggests that not=
 only should we expand trade to create more export-intensive industries, bu=
t that we should also ensure that the workers poised to benefit have access=
 to education and training opportunities.

A second set of complementary policies are being pursued to ensure that mor=
e Americans are in a position to benefit from trade, including both better =
protecting workers from the downsides of dislocation and providing greater =
assistance to workers to get back on their feet and find new jobs if they h=
ave suffered a displacement. Many of the most important policies in this ar=
ea are not trade specific, reflecting the fact that trade is responsible fo=
r only a small portion of the job turnover that American workers face. Prog=
rams like Unemployment Insurance and the Affordable Care Act do not ask why=
 someone lost their job or lacks health insurance-and in fact the vast majo=
rity of workers who benefit from these policies are in that position for re=
asons having nothing to do with trade. The Administration has proposed expa=
nded investments in retraining for dislocated workers, including through pr=
ograms targeted at all sources of dislocation and through the Trade Adjustm=
ent Assistance program (TAA), which is set to expire at the end of this fis=
cal year.

Note that many of these policies-both to increase our competitiveness and e=
nsure more Americans benefit from trade-have potential fiscal costs. But to=
 the degree that increased trade boosts overall economic growth, it helps r=
educe the long-run fiscal gap, freeing up more resources than we would othe=
rwise have had to devote to these complementary policies.


The Role of Trade in Current Debates about the Global Macroeconomic Situati=
on

Larry Summers and Ben Bernanke have recently been engaged in a fascinating =
debate about the current economic situation and the prospects for the futur=
e. The debate concerns the causes and consequences of the extremely low int=
erest rates observed across the globe, following a nearly continuous twenty=
-five year interest rate decline. Summers takes the "secular stagnation" hy=
pothesis seriously, contending that fundamental factors like slowing popula=
tion growth and low capital intensity in new industries are fostering an ex=
cess of saving over investment. Bernanke assigns more weight to an explanat=
ion rooted in international imbalances in trade, saving, and investment, wh=
ich are more often a function of government policies than such fundamental =
factors.

I do not plan to use my remarks today to wade into this debate, but instead=
 to describe the implications that each perspective has for thinking about =
trade policy and international economic policy more broadly.

Secular Stagnation

The secular stagnation hypothesis explicitly concerns aggregate demand. It =
starts with an economy with too few high return investment projects to just=
ify substantial commitments of resources to build new factories and equip t=
hem with new machines. In this environment the central bank's inability to =
lower real interest rates to sufficiently negative levels because of the ze=
ro lower bound on nominal rates could lead to chronically insufficient dema=
nd.

To the degree that trade succeeds in raising the level and growth rate of e=
conomic output not just in the United States but also globally, it would al=
so help increase the number of attractive investment prospects. This would =
raise the equilibrium interest rate and relax the constraint imposed by the=
 zero lower bound on interest rates, thus helping to relieve the underlying=
 stagnation. To be clear: I am not endorsing the hypothesis nor am I claimi=
ng that if it were correct, trade would be enough to cure secular stagnatio=
n or would obviate the need for the other remedies that Summers endorses, l=
ike expanded public infrastructure investment. But I do believe that expand=
ing the growth rate of aggregate supply-through measures that increase prod=
uctivity growth-would help relieve the conditions under which the zero lowe=
r bound can interfere with achieving adequate aggregate demand, whether tod=
ay or in a potential future recession. And as I have explained, trade does =
have the potential to foster greater innovation and productivity growth.

Global Imbalances

The global imbalances view, or "global savings glut" as Bernanke has termed=
 it, also relates to aggregate demand. It posits that a combination of unde=
rlying structural economic features and deliberate policy choices have led =
to an uneven global allocation of saving and investment-with both too much =
saving and too many countries unwilling to deploy a commensurate portion of=
 that saving flow in the form of internal investment. The result for the Un=
ited States, according to this view, is that we import capital to make up t=
he difference between our investment and saving. The flip side of this capi=
tal surplus is that we run a current account deficit-the dominant component=
 of which is our trade deficit. Notably, such trade deficits appear to have=
 been linked with other imbalances, like the debt-fueled housing bubble tha=
t precipitated the financial crisis. Overall, according to this view, large=
, persistent current account deficits driven in part by other countries' cu=
rrent account surpluses, threaten the sustainability of global growth. They=
 force a choice between contractionary pressures and market bubbles that ca=
n boost consumption in the short run but threaten macroeconomic and financi=
al stability down the road.

It is noteworthy in this regard that the United States has made significant=
 strides in rebalancing its economy. Our current account deficit fell from =
5.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2014, the lowest share =
of our economy since the late 1990s. This progress is especially notable gi=
ven our advanced position in the business cycle versus our trading partners=
', which would tend to increase the deficit since domestic demand has outpa=
ced foreign demand. In part, this progress is attributable to our own polic=
ies, including the increase in net national saving associated with the redu=
ction in our Federal budget deficit and the dramatic reduction in net petro=
leum imports. But also in part, the reduction in the current account defici=
t reflects a broader move towards rebalancing in much of the rest of the wo=
rld.

Nevertheless, to the degree that imbalances have been rooted in distortiona=
ry policies in the rest of the world-and to the degree these distortions ex=
ist today-they have a cost for the United States. Global imbalances can be =
understood as being rooted in three factors: macroeconomic policies broadly=
 construed, national exchange rate policies specifically, and other asymmet=
ries across countries, including in trade policies.

The largest source of current global imbalances stems from macroeconomic po=
licies broadly construed. Specifically, while many of the large surplus cou=
ntries have reduced their current account surpluses, the adjustment process=
 in Europe has been more concerning. Countries like Italy and Spain have se=
en their current account deficits turn into small surpluses, in large part =
due to a compression in domestic demand, but this adjustment has not been m=
atched by a corresponding increase in domestic demand in surplus economies.=
 In fact, Germany has seen its current account surplus increase to 7.8 perc=
ent of its GDP. Indeed, Germany's 2014 current account surplus exceeded Chi=
na's in absolute terms as well despite the smaller size of the German econo=
my.

Germany's outsized surplus is largely attributable to its high exports beyo=
nd the borders of the euro area. Germany could implement a number of fiscal=
 or structural policies to increase domestic demand, such as public investm=
ent in infrastructure, increased tax incentives for private investment, or =
greater expansions in wages and consumer spending. These policies could off=
set demand contraction in the weaker European economies and insure against =
a further weakening in the German economy itself. Germany is not the only s=
ubstantial surplus country and macroeconomic policies have contributed to i=
mbalances in other economies as well.

Every international monetary system throughout history has faced the proble=
m that pressures to adjust international payments imbalances are asymmetric=
-much greater for deficit than for surplus countries. Because this fact can=
 complicate policy for deficit economies and give a deflationary bias to th=
e world economy, the G-20 policy coordination process plays an essential ro=
le in highlighting the danger to the global economy from excessive current =
account surpluses.

A second source of global imbalances can be currency policies that target a=
n undervalued exchange rate in order to shift global demand. The United Sta=
tes has made progress toward promoting more transparent, market-based excha=
nge rates as a key element of our international economic policy. We secured=
 a G-7 commitment that monetary policy in member states would remain focuse=
d on domestic economic objectives using domestic instruments rather than ta=
rgeting exchange rates. Moreover, all G-20 member countries have committed =
not to target exchange rates for competitive purposes and to move faster to=
ward market-determined exchange rates.

China has historically had a systematically undervalued exchange rate that =
has contributed to global current account imbalances while helping to susta=
in imbalances within China's own economy. In response, the United States' i=
ntensive economic diplomacy with China-including through the Strategic and =
Economic Dialogue (S&ED)-has made some progress addressing these key concer=
ns. The yuan has seen a real effective appreciation of nearly 30 percent si=
nce China allowed its currency to resume appreciation in mid-2010 and the C=
hinese current account surplus has fallen from 10.0 percent of GDP in 2007 =
to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The United States and the broader global eco=
nomic community will continue to push China to fulfill its S&ED commitments=
 to move towards a market-determined exchange rate.

The third source of global imbalances is other economic asymmetries across =
countries, including asymmetries in the level of government interventions t=
hat distort the free flow of trade. For a given set of exchange rates, the =
openness of the U.S. economy combined with the often larger barriers to our=
 exports to the rest of the world can be a source of imbalance. In that res=
pect, it is notable that, using available data, the United States is curren=
tly running a small goods and services trade surplus with the totality of o=
ur 20 Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners-as compared to a trade deficit wi=
th all other countries. Moreover, TPP would disproportionately result in ta=
riff and non-tariff barrier reductions by our trading partners, which-for g=
iven exchange rate and income levels-would result in higher net exports tha=
n in TPP's absence.

Today's largest current account imbalances stem from macroeconomic policies=
, and addressing them will require continued efforts in the G-20 and other =
fora. But that does not detract from the importance of trade agreements lik=
e TPP in mitigating global imbalances or from continued aggressive and effe=
ctive actions on exchange rates using multilateral and bilateral tools and =
channels.

The bottom line is that regardless if one places more weight on either the =
secular stagnation hypothesis or the global imbalances view, trade liberali=
zation offers important economic benefits that help address either concern.=
 Secular stagnation would be ameliorated by faster productivity growth and =
an expanded range of productive investment opportunities-an important effec=
t of high-standard trade agreements like TPP. Those who subscribe to the gl=
obal imbalances view of the world seek a level competitive playing field fo=
r global trade to help resolve such imbalances-and high-standard trade agre=
ements like TPP are also designed to do just that.


Conclusion

As genuinely important and timely as these questions are, I want to bring t=
hese remarks to a close by returning to my main theme-the future of product=
ivity growth. I believe productivity is a much more fundamentally important=
 determinant of the long-run future of the U.S. economy and middle-class in=
comes than the essentially more demand-side perspective advanced by either =
the secular stagnation or global imbalances theories.

Trade has many advantages. In the 2015 Economic Report of the President, we=
 described a number of others besides increased productivity growth, includ=
ing trade's role in reducing global poverty, improving working conditions i=
n the developing world, promoting gender equality, and increasing investmen=
ts in green technologies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.

But ultimately, and most importantly, trade is an important driver of long-=
run economic growth. Enacting high-standard and values-driven trade agreeme=
nts is a significant plus-and even more so when they are part of a broader =
economic agenda to expand public and private investment in America's worker=
s, businesses, and infrastructure.

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">It is great to be back at Brookings, an institution =
I fondly called my home before joining the Obama Administration. Brookings =
has long played an important role in the development, discussion, and advan=
cement of economic policies and I
 expect no less from today&#8217;s forum.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">One of the main goals of economic policy is to raise=
 the incomes of middle-class households and those working to get into the m=
iddle class. A necessary&#8212;but certainly not sufficient&#8212;condition=
 for sustained increases in incomes is stronger
 economic growth. Indeed, the recovery has accelerated in recent years: our=
 economy grew 2.8 percent over the past two years, compared with 2.1 percen=
t over the first three-and-a-half years of the recovery, while the labor ma=
rket is in the midst of the longest
 stretch of monthly job growth on record.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But the longer-run income trends are more troubling.=
 In the post-war years, middle-class households enjoyed annual income growt=
h of about 3 percent per year. Since the 1970s, however, income growth has =
fallen to about half a percent a year.
 The largest cause of this slowdown has been a slower productivity growth. =
Rising inequality and, more recently, declining labor force participation r=
ates, have also played important roles.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In my remarks today, I will focus on one key instrum=
ent that can help boost middle-class incomes: expanding trade. The policies=
 here include regional agreements, specifically the Trans-Pacific Partnersh=
ip (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade
 and Investment Partnership (T-TIP)&#8212; trade agreements that tie togeth=
er two-thirds of the world economy. They also include multilateral efforts =
through the World Trade Organization (WTO), including the WTO Information T=
echnology Agreement, the WTO Trade Facilitation
 Agreement, the Trade in Services Agreement, and the Environmental Goods Ag=
reement.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">First, I will briefly outline the conventional econo=
mic arguments for the ways these agreements can benefit middle-class famili=
es, both by improving the quality of jobs and by expanding choice for consu=
mers and producers. Second, the major
 focus of my remarks will be on what I believe to be an underappreciated&#8=
212;but perhaps even more important&#8212;contribution of expanded trade: i=
ncreasing innovation and thus economic growth. Third, I will briefly consid=
er how the more level playing field created
 by our proposed trade agreements increases the returns to complementary po=
licies designed to help expand the U.S. economy and benefit U.S. workers. F=
inally, I will offer some thoughts about how our international efforts, par=
ticularly in the trade area, relate
 to some of the current debates over secular stagnation and global imbalanc=
es.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b>The Traditional Case for Trade: Comparative Advan=
tage and its Implications for Household Incomes</b><span style=3D"font-size=
:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><o:p></o:p></span></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The traditional case for trade is based on an exerci=
se in comparative statics: comparing the allocation of production and consu=
mption in autarky (or with trade barriers) to what it would be under free t=
rade (or with reduced trade barriers).
 Adam Smith was one of the first to frame the problem and some of the earli=
est analytics were developed by David Ricardo in his theory of comparative =
advantage&#8212;the idea that countries should specialize in and export to =
other countries what they produce relatively
 efficiently, and import from other countries what they produce relatively =
inefficiently.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In the nearly 200 years since Ricardo published his =
ideas, economists have identified a number of further benefits to trade tha=
t fit within this comparative statics paradigm. First, the ability to sell =
to a larger world market allows firms
 to take better advantage of increasing returns to scale. Second, much of t=
he expansion in trade is along the &#8220;extensive margin,&#8221; so reduc=
ed tariffs do not merely increase trade in currently traded products, but a=
lso open up trading opportunities for new firms
 and new products. And third, foreign direct investment is especially impor=
tant for improving overall productive efficiency.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Together these different economic forces translate i=
nto two very simple benefits for the middle-class: better jobs and improved=
 living standards. Studies of U.S. manufacturing industries document that, =
on average, export-intensive industries
 pay workers up to 18 percent more than non-export-intensive industries. Ex=
tensive economic research shows higher average wages in exporting firms, po=
ssibly because those firms are more productive and thus have higher profits=
, or because they seek out skilled
 workers to produce high-quality goods. When controlling for industry and w=
orker characteristics, CEA finds that the average industry&#8217;s strong i=
ncrease in exports over the 1990s and 2000s translated into an additional $=
1,300 in annual earnings for the typical
 worker. That corresponds to more than two months&#8217; worth of an averag=
e family&#8217;s food spending. As a result, increased exports are one rout=
e to higher middle-class wages.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Higher living standards result because trade allows =
countries to specialize in their comparatively productive lines of business=
. When our trading partners produce goods relatively more efficiently, the =
United States can import goods at
 lower prices than if we were to use our scarce resources to produce those =
goods ourselves. These lower prices raise real wages, helping U.S. consumer=
s purchase more with their current incomes. International trade also offers=
 consumers a wider range of products
 to choose from&#8212;from year-round fresh fruit to affordable clothing&#8=
212;offering value equivalent to 2.6 percent of GDP by one estimate. The gr=
eater variety of imports available at lower prices also reduces firms&#8217=
; production costs through imported intermediate inputs,
 thereby helping American businesses to expand production and employment an=
d increase the wages they can afford to pay. Since World War II, reductions=
 in U.S. tariffs are estimated to have contributed an additional 7.3 percen=
t to American incomes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">One of the next critical efforts in liberalizing tra=
de and opening foreign markets is TPP, an agreement we are negotiating with=
 11 other countries that together with the United States represent nearly 4=
0 percent of the global economy.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The starting point of TPP is the contrast between U.=
S. tariffs and those of our partner countries. Our trade-weighted average a=
pplied tariff rate is 1.4 percent and 70 percent of imports already enter o=
ur economy duty free. In contrast,
 on average, our TPP partners report simple average applied tariffs 1.5 per=
centage points higher than our equivalent rate. In some TPP countries, aver=
age tariffs are up to 4 percentage points higher, though this difference ma=
sks considerable industry-specific
 variation; the United States faces tariffs of up to 30 percent on auto exp=
orts to Malaysia and 40 percent on agricultural goods to Vietnam. Many TPP =
countries also have substantially higher non-tariff barriers, particularly =
in the area of services trade, where
 the United States maintains a strong comparative advantage. As a result, T=
PP will disproportionately decrease foreign barriers to U.S. exports. In ad=
dition, TPP will include the highest and most enforceable labor and environ=
mental standards of any trade agreement
 and will be the first trade agreement to put disciplines on state-owned en=
terprises and to ensure a free and open internet.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The most comprehensive estimates of the benefits of =
TPP are those of Peter Petri, Michael Plummer, and Fan Zhai, who employ an =
18-sector, 24-region computable general equilibrium model to simulate polic=
y changes in more than twenty different
 areas including tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and rules governing foreign =
direct investment. They find that by 2025, TPP would raise U.S. incomes by =
0.4 percent per year, the equivalent of $77 billion in 2007 dollars, althou=
gh the actual estimate could vary
 somewhat depending on the details of the agreement and alternative modelli=
ng assumptions. The European Union has said that the United States would ga=
in a comparable amount from T-TIP. Some have described these totals as smal=
l, but I think I would risk losing
 my license to offer economic advice if I counseled anyone to leave $77 bil=
lion lying on the sidewalk each year.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b>The New Case for Trade: Expanding Competition, In=
novation, and Economic Growth</b><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But these estimates may understate&#8212;perhaps eve=
n grossly understate&#8212;the benefits of TPP, T-TIP, and expanded trade m=
ore generally. All of these estimates are essentially based on comparative =
statics. But as Petri, Plummer and Zhai were the
 first to point out, &#8220;[e]conomic integration may have large additiona=
l benefits that are not adequately captured by microeconomic models&#8221; =
because these models do not incorporate the effects of trade on the
<i>rate</i> of innovation and thus the rate of economic growth. Or in the w=
ords of Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, &#8220;[r]elatively fre=
e trade has the advantage that the possibility of increasing market share i=
n world markets is a constant incentive
 for innovative activity.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Thanks to the pioneering work of Solow himself more =
than a half century ago, economists understand innovation in terms of total=
 factor productivity&#8212;the total amount of output that can be produced =
from a given amount of inputs like capital
 and labor. In what follows, I explore two ways in which trade can increase=
 total factor productivity: as a direct input into the innovation productio=
n function and as an increased incentive to innovate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"page-break-after:avoid"><i>Trade and the In=
novation Production Function</i><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"page-break-after:avoid"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">We can think of innovation as being produced by a pr=
oduction function that combines inputs like research and development (R&amp=
;D). Trade can directly increase the level of innovation for a given amount=
 of inputs. Specifically:<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u>Greater R&amp;D specialization can increase innov=
ation</u>. The static arguments about comparative advantage can be extended=
 to R&amp;D and innovation itself. Greater specialization can increase the =
amount of knowledge produced per unit of R&amp;D
 investment if companies in different countries focus on innovating in the =
areas where they have a comparative advantage. For example, if engineers at=
 Toshiba focus on improving memory chips, and engineers at Intel focus on i=
mproving microprocessors, the R&amp;D
 productivity of each firm may be higher, leading to better and cheaper com=
puters than if each company had to improve both components simultaneously.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">One study of R&amp;D specialization shows that stren=
gthening foreign intellectual property protection, as TPP would do, leads t=
o more outward licensing from the United States, where U.S. companies allow=
 other companies to use their ideas, products,
 or processes in exchange for royalty payments. Specifically, the authors f=
ind that royalty payments from foreign affiliates to U.S. parent companies =
increase by 16.6 percent on average following a reform that strengthens int=
ellectual property rights in the
 affiliates&#8217; home country. This finding highlights the role of non-ta=
riff barriers for shaping trade in ideas, particularly if one country speci=
alizes in the &#8220;R&#8221; and the other in the &#8220;D.&#8221;<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u><o:p><span style=3D"text-decoration:none">&nbsp;<=
/span></o:p></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u>Trade also helps firms become more productive by =
accelerating the global flow of ideas</u>. Both exporters and importers are=
 frequently exposed to new ideas and novel tools, materials, or techniques =
that make them more productive. For
 example, many multinational companies have systems and standards to promot=
e the diffusion of &#8220;best practices&#8221; within their global supply =
chains. Learning also occurs when a firm adapts novel ideas to suit its own=
 operating environment, leading to both new
 goods and greater productivity. For example, many American manufacturers a=
nd businesses in other industries have adopted aspects of the &#8220;lean&#=
8221; production system, which was originally developed in Japan, and reali=
zed substantial productivity benefits by tailoring
 the underlying ideas to meet their own needs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">In addition, export activity offers firms opportunit=
ies to learn about foreign markets&#8212;perhaps even gaining technical exp=
ertise from foreign buyers&#8212;leading to increased productivity. This &#=
8220;learning-by-exporting&#8221; theory has support in a
 body of research spanning many countries and time periods.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Many of the new ideas that diffuse through trade are=
 embodied in intermediate inputs. In fact, roughly half of all U.S. imports=
 are inputs into the production of final goods. As noted earlier, increases=
 in the quality and variety of these
 inputs can reduce domestic firms&#8217; production costs, thereby inducing=
 American importers to expand production and employment. For example, a cla=
ssic paper shows that a country&#8217;s gains from international trade incr=
ease substantially when the benefits of cheaper
 and more varied imported production inputs are taken into account.<o:p></o=
:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><i>Trade and the Incentive to Innovate</i><o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">So far, I have discussed two ways that trade can mak=
e the innovation process more efficient. Trade can also boost productivity =
growth by increasing the incentive to innovate.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u><o:p><span style=3D"text-decoration:none">&nbsp;<=
/span></o:p></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u>For example, Solow has highlighted the link betwe=
en market size and innovation</u>. International trade allows companies to =
access a larger market, which yields more profit for a given level of innov=
ation, and therefore raises the incentive
 to innovate. For example, the global reach of the &#8220;App Stores&#8221;=
 managed by Apple and Google contributes to the large number of software de=
velopers who populate those distribution platforms. One recent study found =
empirical evidence of learning-by-exporting
 among low-productivity plants. Another study finds that firms with experie=
nce in foreign markets have a greater probability of R&amp;D investment, co=
nsistent with the idea that accessing larger foreign markets translates int=
o higher expected returns to research
 and development.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><u>Finally, even holding market size constant, incre=
ased trade can promote innovation by strengthening competition</u>. More th=
an fifty years ago, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow pointed=
 out that a monopolist may have relatively
 weak incentives to innovate, because its innovations do not allow it to &#=
8220;steal&#8221; business from competitors. A similar idea appears in more=
 recent &#8220;Schumpeterian&#8221; models of innovation and economic growt=
h, where competition can promote growth by increasing the
 expected payoffs of successful innovation. By bringing companies into a wo=
rldwide marketplace, trade greatly increases the incentive for a firm to in=
novate in order to win business from its competitors, reinforcing the marke=
t-size effects discussed above.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">However, Schumpeterian models also suggest that too =
much competition can reduce innovation, because firms will not wish to inve=
st in R&amp;D if their discoveries are easily copied and the resulting prof=
its immediately dissipated. Intellectual
 property laws help determine where a country falls on the Schumpeterian sp=
ectrum between too little and too much competition, and our trade policies =
can promote harmonization around a set of rules that strike the appropriate=
 balance for promoting long-run
 growth and job creation.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><i>Does Trade Cause Innovation or Does Innovation Ca=
use Trade?</i><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">While my comments have emphasized how trade can prom=
ote innovation and productivity growth, it is important to note that this r=
elationship runs in both directions. That is, increased trade can promote i=
nnovation, and at the same time, increased
 innovation can promote trade. At the individual firm level, the decision t=
o innovate and the decision to trade are jointly determined as part of a co=
mprehensive investment strategy. This creates interesting challenges and op=
portunities for economic research
 that aims to isolate the causal effects of a particular mechanism. The mes=
sage for policy is simpler, as one recent review of the evidence calls the =
relationship between trade and productivity growth a &#8220;robust finding&=
#8221;&#8212;trade is one of several tools that we
 can use to promote long-term growth in productivity and middle-class incom=
es.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"page-break-after:avoid"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"page-break-after:avoid">I have described th=
e many opportunities offered by trade to create good new jobs, benefit cons=
umers, and expand innovation and growth. However, globalization, like any o=
ther domestic source of innovation,
 can also create challenges. Globalization has played a role in the increas=
e in inequality, although most economists would rank it below factors like =
technology, education, and labor market institutions. Globalization can als=
o lead to increased turnover and
 dislocation&#8212;although the dislocation due to trade is only a small fr=
action of the dislocation in the economy in any given month, and much of th=
e turnover generated by trade can be seen in the shift to more high-quality=
 jobs.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But these challenges are real and merit a serious po=
licy response. Part of this policy response lies in the observation that ma=
ny of the downsides of globalization stem from factors outside of trade pol=
icy&#8212;factors like improvements in transportation
 and information technologies which have driven the recent rise in world tr=
ade. This perspective suggests that the importance of TPP is to ensure that=
 we are managing the process of globalization, for example by incorporating=
 stronger labor and environmental
 standards than we would have in the absence of these agreements. But this =
perspective also underscores the importance of policies to complement expan=
ded trade.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The Administration would be seeking more investment =
in infrastructure, research and education as well as reforms to our busines=
s tax system regardless of our position in the global economy. But greater =
global integration can increase the
 returns to all of these policies by expanding the size of markets, attract=
ing foreign businesses to invest in the United States, and offering better =
employment opportunities. For example, as I said earlier, the unconditional=
 labor premium in export-intensive
 jobs is 18 percent over non export-intensive jobs. But this comparison is =
between unconditional means&#8212;among other factors, it reflects the fact=
 that workers in export-intensive industries are better educated and specia=
lly trained. This suggests that not only
 should we expand trade to create more export-intensive industries, but tha=
t we should also ensure that the workers poised to benefit have access to e=
ducation and training opportunities.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">A second set of complementary policies are being pur=
sued to ensure that more Americans are in a position to benefit from trade,=
 including both better protecting workers from the downsides of dislocation=
 and providing greater assistance
 to workers to get back on their feet and find new jobs if they have suffer=
ed a displacement. Many of the most important policies in this area are not=
 trade specific, reflecting the fact that trade is responsible for only a s=
mall portion of the job turnover
 that American workers face. Programs like Unemployment Insurance and the A=
ffordable Care Act do not ask why someone lost their job or lacks health in=
surance&#8212;and in fact the vast majority of workers who benefit from the=
se policies are in that position for reasons
 having nothing to do with trade. The Administration has proposed expanded =
investments in retraining for dislocated workers, including through program=
s targeted at all sources of dislocation and through the Trade Adjustment A=
ssistance program (TAA), which is
 set to expire at the end of this fiscal year.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Note that many of these policies&#8212;both to incre=
ase our competitiveness and ensure more Americans benefit from trade&#8212;=
have potential fiscal costs. But to the degree that increased trade boosts =
overall economic growth, it helps reduce the long-run
 fiscal gap, freeing up more resources than we would otherwise have had to =
devote to these complementary policies.<o:p></o:p></p>

p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"page-break-after:avoid">Larry Summers and B=
en Bernanke have recently been engaged in a fascinating debate about the cu=
rrent economic situation and the prospects for the future. The debate conce=
rns the causes and consequences of the
 extremely low interest rates observed across the globe, following a nearly=
 continuous twenty-five year interest rate decline. Summers takes the &#822=
0;secular stagnation&#8221; hypothesis seriously, contending that fundament=
al factors like slowing population growth and
 low capital intensity in new industries are fostering an excess of saving =
over investment. Bernanke assigns more weight to an explanation rooted in i=
nternational imbalances in trade, saving, and investment, which are more of=
ten a function of government policies
 than such fundamental factors.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I do not plan to use my remarks today to wade into t=
his debate, but instead to describe the implications that each perspective =
has for thinking about trade policy and international economic policy more =
broadly.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><i>Secular Stagnation<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The secular stagnation hypothesis explicitly concern=
s aggregate demand. It starts with an economy with too few high return inve=
stment projects to justify substantial commitments of resources to build ne=
w factories and equip them with new
 machines. In this environment the central bank&#8217;s inability to lower =
real interest rates to sufficiently negative levels because of the zero low=
er bound on nominal rates could lead to chronically insufficient demand.<o:=
p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">To the degree that trade succeeds in raising the lev=
el and growth rate of economic output not just in the United States but als=
o globally, it would also help increase the number of attractive investment=
 prospects. This would raise the equilibrium
 interest rate and relax the constraint imposed by the zero lower bound on =
interest rates, thus helping to relieve the underlying stagnation. To be cl=
ear: I am not endorsing the hypothesis nor am I claiming that if it were co=
rrect, trade would be enough to
 cure secular stagnation or would obviate the need for the other remedies t=
hat Summers endorses, like expanded public infrastructure investment. But I=
 do believe that expanding the growth rate of aggregate supply&#8212;throug=
h measures that increase productivity
 growth&#8212;would help relieve the conditions under which the zero lower =
bound can interfere with achieving adequate aggregate demand, whether today=
 or in a potential future recession. And as I have explained, trade does ha=
ve the potential to foster greater innovation
 and productivity growth.<o:p></o:p></p>

p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"page-break-after:avoid">The global imbalanc=
es view, or &#8220;global savings glut&#8221; as Bernanke has termed it, al=
so relates to aggregate demand. It posits that a combination of underlying =
structural economic features and deliberate policy
 choices have led to an uneven global allocation of saving and investment&#=
8212;with both too much saving and too many countries unwilling to deploy a=
 commensurate portion of that saving flow in the form of internal investmen=
t. The result for the United States, according
 to this view, is that we import capital to make up the difference between =
our investment and saving. The flip side of this capital surplus is that we=
 run a current account deficit&#8212;the dominant component of which is our=
 trade deficit. Notably, such trade deficits
 appear to have been linked with other imbalances, like the debt-fueled hou=
sing bubble that precipitated the financial crisis. Overall, according to t=
his view, large, persistent current account deficits driven in part by othe=
r countries&#8217; current account surpluses,
 threaten the sustainability of global growth. They force a choice between =
contractionary pressures and market bubbles that can boost consumption in t=
he short run but threaten macroeconomic and financial stability down the ro=
ad.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">It is noteworthy in this regard that the United Stat=
es has made significant strides in rebalancing its economy. Our current acc=
ount deficit fell from 5.8 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2.4 percent of GDP in =
2014, the lowest share of our economy
 since the late 1990s. This progress is especially notable given our advanc=
ed position in the business cycle versus our trading partners&#8217;, which=
 would tend to increase the deficit since domestic demand has outpaced fore=
ign demand. In part, this progress is
 attributable to our own policies, including the increase in net national s=
aving associated with the reduction in our Federal budget deficit and the d=
ramatic reduction in net petroleum imports. But also in part, the reduction=
 in the current account deficit
 reflects a broader move towards rebalancing in much of the rest of the wor=
ld.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Nevertheless, to the degree that imbalances have bee=
n rooted in distortionary policies in the rest of the world&#8212;and to th=
e degree these distortions exist today&#8212;they have a cost for the Unite=
d States. Global imbalances can be understood
 as being rooted in three factors: macroeconomic policies broadly construed=
, national exchange rate policies specifically, and other asymmetries acros=
s countries, including in trade policies.
<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The largest source of current global imbalances stem=
s from macroeconomic policies broadly construed. Specifically, while many o=
f the large surplus countries have reduced their current account surpluses,=
 the adjustment process in Europe
 has been more concerning. Countries like Italy and Spain have seen their c=
urrent account deficits turn into small surpluses, in large part due to a c=
ompression in domestic demand, but this adjustment has not been matched by =
a corresponding increase in domestic
 demand in surplus economies. In fact, Germany has seen its current account=
 surplus increase to 7.8 percent of its GDP. Indeed, Germany&#8217;s 2014 c=
urrent account surplus exceeded China&#8217;s in absolute terms as well des=
pite the smaller size of the German economy.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Germany&#8217;s outsized surplus is largely attribut=
able to its high exports beyond the borders of the euro area. Germany could=
 implement a number of fiscal or structural policies to increase domestic d=
emand, such as public investment in infrastructure,
 increased tax incentives for private investment, or greater expansions in =
wages and consumer spending. These policies could offset demand contraction=
 in the weaker European economies and insure against a further weakening in=
 the German economy itself. Germany
 is not the only substantial surplus country and macroeconomic policies hav=
e contributed to imbalances in other economies as well.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Every international monetary system throughout histo=
ry has faced the problem that pressures to adjust international payments im=
balances are asymmetric&#8212;much greater for deficit than for surplus cou=
ntries. Because this fact can complicate
 policy for deficit economies and give a deflationary bias to the world eco=
nomy, the G-20 policy coordination process plays an essential role in highl=
ighting the danger to the global economy from excessive current account sur=
pluses.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">A second source of global imbalances can be currency=
 policies that target an undervalued exchange rate in order to shift global=
 demand. The United States has made progress toward promoting more transpar=
ent, market-based exchange rates as
 a key element of our international economic policy. We secured a G-7 commi=
tment that monetary policy in member states would remain focused on domesti=
c economic objectives using domestic instruments rather than targeting exch=
ange rates. Moreover, all G-20 member
 countries have committed not to target exchange rates for competitive purp=
oses and to move faster toward market-determined exchange rates.<o:p></o:p>=
</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">China has historically had a systematically underval=
ued exchange rate that has contributed to global current account imbalances=
 while helping to sustain imbalances within China&#8217;s own economy. In r=
esponse, the United States&#8217; intensive economic
 diplomacy with China&#8212;including through the Strategic and Economic Di=
alogue (S&amp;ED)&#8212;has made some progress addressing these key concern=
s. The yuan has seen a real effective appreciation of nearly 30 percent sin=
ce China allowed its currency to resume appreciation
 in mid-2010 and the Chinese current account surplus has fallen from 10.0 p=
ercent of GDP in 2007 to 2.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The United States and =
the broader global economic community will continue to push China to fulfil=
l its S&amp;ED commitments to move towards
 a market-determined exchange rate.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The third source of global imbalances is other econo=
mic asymmetries across countries, including asymmetries in the level of gov=
ernment interventions that distort the free flow of trade. For a given set =
of exchange rates, the openness of
 the U.S. economy combined with the often larger barriers to our exports to=
 the rest of the world can be a source of imbalance. In that respect, it is=
 notable that, using available data, the United States is currently running=
 a small goods and services trade
 surplus with the totality of our 20 Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners&#8=
212;as compared to a trade deficit with all other countries. Moreover, TPP =
would disproportionately result in tariff and non-tariff barrier reductions=
 by our trading partners, which&#8212;for given
 exchange rate and income levels&#8212;would result in higher net exports t=
han in TPP&#8217;s absence.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Today&#8217;s largest current account imbalances ste=
m from macroeconomic policies, and addressing them will require continued e=
fforts in the G-20 and other fora. But that does not detract from the impor=
tance of trade agreements like TPP in mitigating
 global imbalances or from continued aggressive and effective actions on ex=
change rates using multilateral and bilateral tools and channels.<o:p></o:p=
></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The bottom line is that regardless if one places mor=
e weight on either the secular stagnation hypothesis or the global imbalanc=
es view, trade liberalization offers important economic benefits that help =
address either concern. Secular stagnation
 would be ameliorated by faster productivity growth and an expanded range o=
f productive investment opportunities&#8212;an important effect of high-sta=
ndard trade agreements like TPP. Those who subscribe to the global imbalanc=
es view of the world seek a level competitive
 playing field for global trade to help resolve such imbalances&#8212;and h=
igh-standard trade agreements like TPP are also designed to do just that.<o=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">As genuinely important and timely as these questions=
 are, I want to bring these remarks to a close by returning to my main them=
e&#8212;the future of productivity growth. I believe productivity is a much=
 more fundamentally important determinant
 of the long-run future of the U.S. economy and middle-class incomes than t=
he essentially more demand-side perspective advanced by either the secular =
stagnation or global imbalances theories.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Trade has many advantages. In the 2015 <i>Economic R=
eport of the President,</i> we described a number of others besides increas=
ed productivity growth, including trade&#8217;s role in reducing global pov=
erty, improving working conditions in the
 developing world, promoting gender equality, and increasing investments in=
 green technologies to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">But ultimately, and most importantly, trade is an im=
portant driver of long-run economic growth. Enacting high-standard and valu=
es-driven trade agreements is a significant plus&#8212;and even more so whe=
n they are part of a broader economic agenda
 to expand public and private investment in America&#8217;s workers, busine=
