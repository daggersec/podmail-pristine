I'm inputing the latest names I've received into the overall list, =
sorting by diversity and subject matter area.

I also have started creating slates names against positions with pools =
of people to be considered as part of the larger team (e.g., deputies, =
unders, etc.), the goal of which is not for him to make any decisions, =
but to see the type/scope of names we're coming up with, including from =
the perspective of diversity, experience, etc.

I think we fundamentally want to get just general guidance fron him, but =
to the degree he has any specific reactions, positive or negative, that =
would be useful feedback.

We can decide tomorrow whether we want to use it or just have it in =
reserve.
