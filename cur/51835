I'm really sorry that you didn't get the powerpoint. It was finalized late
this morning when the madness with your flights had started and I failed to
track who was actually getting the powerpoint into your hands. It was
absolutely my responsibility and I dropped the ball.

I am deeply sorry. I absolutely did not intend for that type of breakdown
to happen today and will do everything I can to make sure it doesn't happen
again.
