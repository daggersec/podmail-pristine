So afraid that NYT is going with this story on Priorities whether we like
or not.  They have sources about the meetings.  Honestly, it sounds like
Priorities staff was yapping.   We are not confirming meetings on this trip
but commenting on why we are participating with Priorities.

FYI =E2=80=93 the New York Times will soon report that HRC is doing meeting=
s for
Priorities USA.  We have NOT confirmed the meeting and will not be
confirming these types of meetings.



We are, however, reflecting how will support Priorities USA work where
needed and framed this up.



If you get press questions as follow ups on this, please send them to me.





*DEEP BACKGROUND (CLINTON OFFICIAL/NO QUOTE)*



=C2=B7         Like the Obama campaign did in the 2012 election, the Clinto=
n
campaign will support Priorities USA as is appropriate under the law.

=C2=B7         Campaign officials, including the candidate may, from time t=
o
time, attend, speak at or be featured guests at their events.

=C2=B7         No one with the campaign will solicit more than the federal =
limit
($5,000) for Priorities USA, as  permitted by law.

 *BACKGROUND (CLINTON OFFICIAL)*

 =E2=80=9CWith some Republican candidates reportedly setting up and outsour=
cing
their entire campaign to SuperPAC=E2=80=99s and the Koch Brothers pledging =
$1
billion alone for the 2016 campaign, Democrats have to have the resources
to fight back. There is too much at stake for our future for Democrats to
unilaterally disarm. Hillary Clinton and her campaign team will be
encouraging of Priorities USA because they have the proven record of a
successful national campaign that drove home a critical message in 2012.=E2=
