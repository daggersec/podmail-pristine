AFL-CIO: High-gear Obama turnout drive

With less than four weeks until Election Day, the AFL-CIO is kicking into h=
igh gear as it targets the hardest to persuade voters that Barack Obama sho=
uld be the next president.
=20
Using phone calls, mail and direct conversations at the workplace, the labo=
r organization is pinpointing veterans, gun owners and retirees. (See the d=
irect mailer here: AFL-CIO mailer.pdf
=20
"They're conflicted more than most union members," said Karen Ackerman, pol=
itical director of the AFL-CIO, noting that many people in these categories=
 prize Republican John McCain's military service as a key credential.
=20
To reach these voters, union members who are also veterans are talking to t=
hem about their respect for McCain's service to the country, but also why h=
e's not their choice for president. Those reasons are largely economic, suc=
h as McCain's support for privatizing Social Security and taxing health car=
e benefits.
=20
"In the last four weeks we've really seen a shift and it's based on what's =
happening in the financial sector," Ackerman said. "Members are talking abo=
ut having to work more years...As the economy is more and more central - in=
 the general public as well - there's much more solidifying around support =
for Obama."
=20
The AFL-CIO has expanded its presidential map to 20 states in recent days, =
trying to persuade voters in North Carolina and Indiana, which are typicall=
y red states.
=20
"It's a very good place to be," said Ackerman. "We're really seeing a rejec=
tion of the Bush economic policies and people are really nervous as well."
