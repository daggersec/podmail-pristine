You'll call Ron?  If you could get us his contact info, we'll then
follow up.

I'll reach out to Jim S., Susan and Janet.  We can proceed with Larry
and Tim as well, though I wonder whether we should wait until Barack has
a chance to meet Tim next week. =20

Re Jim Jones, do you think you ought to chat with Barack before he
reaches out to Jim Jones to make sure he's sufficiently sensitive to the
process concerns/team dynamic?
=20

He wanted to talk to Jones so hold on that. Let's hold on the Senators
also, but add Ron Kirk.  I'll call him tomorrow.

So, just to review from our conversation Sunday, with regard to the
private vet, should we assume we start with the following?

Tim Geithner
Larry Summers
Jim Jones
Jim Steinberg
Jack Reed
Janet Napolitano
John Kerry
Susan Rice
Chuck Hagel

(Recall that Dodd and Daschle have already been done.)

I am assuming that we wait on Rahm until Barack has had his conversation
with him, and Dennis Blair until they at least meet and we get a sense
of Barack's comfort level with him. =20

The vetting of Bob Rubin could probably wait until he indicates whether
there is any circumstance in which he would consider taking the Treasury
job (and whether Barack would prefer that, even if it were time-limited,
to Tim or Larry.) I don't think we need to do as much of a vet for Harry
Hopkins role.

Should we do ahead with Ron Kirk on the theory that Barack wants him to
serve somewhere?

Let's talk about outreach to each of these.
