New Hampshire is an uphill climb for Hillary.  Recent public polls show
Bernie Sanders with as much as a 20 to 30 point lead. But Hillary pledged
to fight for every vote in every state and that's exactly what she's going
to do here in New Hampshire.  The Democratic primary process is a long one
and it is built to be difficult.  We=E2=80=99d like to win every state, but=
 know
that is not going to happen.  But even when she is behind, Hillary Clinton
is always going to fight for every vote.



New Hampshire is Bernie's backyard and that gives him a big advantage.
Nate Silver estimates neighbor state candidates enjoy a 15% lift in New
Hampshire on average, and history back up his assessment.  In the last 30
years, border state candidates have always won the New Hampshire primary.
It=E2=80=99s true that she came from behind to win in 2008 but she was not =
running
against a neighbor.



Hillary has also faced some still headwinds from the Republicans and their
super PACs. Before Hillary Clinton announced she would be running for
President, Republicans started attacking her on television and radio.  To
date, GOP candidates and Super PACs have spent nearly $6 million in New
Hampshire alone attacking Hillary =E2=80=93 not Sanders. Because this was a
Democratic primary, we were not running responses to the Republicans.



Hillary Clinton loves New Hampshire and has a lot of respect for its First
in the Nation status.  New Hampshire has been very good to her and her
family so no matter how tough the odds or improbable a win =E2=80=93 she is=
 never
going to quit on the people of this state.
