::: ProgressNow - Building the online progressive movement state by state :=
::=20



Dear Colleagues and Friends,

I believe you're aware that ProgressNow National is evolving as
the state affiliates continue their successful work. I'm writing
to give you a quick update on the national organization and a preview
of what to expect from us in the coming year.

As you know, our very entrepreneurial cofounders-CEO Michael
Huttner and Executive Director Bobby Clark-have both recently
moved into new roles. Michael has started his own political consulting
firm with some exciting initial work that is highly related to
ProgressNow and Bobby is now Vice President of Communications at the
Gill Foundation, a donor to and strong supporter of ProgressNow. While
it was hard for us to say goodbye to Michael and Bobby, they leave a
great organization that fills a strong niche in the progressive
community.

Prompted by Mike's and Bobby's departure, the national
board and senior leaders of our 11 state affiliates have undertaken
intense research, planning and visioning toward a more sustainable and
nimble ProgressNow National-one which even more powerfully meets
the communications and organizing needs of progressives in the states.

We have recruited Denise Cardinal, founder and Executive Director of
Alliance for a Better Minnesota (ABM), to serve as ProgressNow's
new Executive Director. ABM is one of our most successful state
affiliates and a recognized leader in building dynamic and flexible
statewide progressive communications capacity. In choosing Denise, we
intentionally selected a leader who is thoroughly versed in our work
on the ground, understands cutting-edge communications and organizing
technologies, and can navigate the national progressive scene to build
strong national partnerships.

Going forward, ProgressNow National will focus on providing state
affiliates with three critical core capacities:=A0 tools like
technology and training, national presence and collaboration
opportunities. We're investigating new partnerships that will
strengthen these core capacities, including creative ways to partner
with Media Matters, Public Interest Network, Center for American
Progress and/or US Action on activities such as joint, state-based
reports and fact-checking of right wing media, as well as a potential
technology-sharing arrangement with Media Matters.

Finally we're exploring launching an "incubator"
project that would create basic progressive communications hubs in key
states where ProgressNow does not currently have a presence, and
provide a path for them to become ProgressNow affiliates. We know
there's a lot of interest out there in replicating our
successful models in other states, and we're working to find the
most effective and efficient ways to facilitate that.

Stay tuned and thank you so much for your continued support -
it's made a huge difference to the movement.

-- Ted Trimpa
