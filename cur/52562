Subject:

Matt McKenna has requested via Bari and HR an increase of 1500 monthly in h=
is foundation consultant work to cover what he claims and Bari claims is wo=
rk he is doing on behalf of CVC as it relates to her role with CF.  The new=
 breakdown of his total compensation would be as follows if we approve this=
:

4000 Foundation (2500 Non CVC + 1500 CVC)
2500 CESC
1500 CVC Office (For profit work)

I have no idea how they achieved what is a 50/50 split on his CVC work betw=
een her for profit and CF activities.  I think it=92s more heavily weighted=
 toward her for profit and would think it would be closer to a 75/25 split.=
  I  have pushed back on Matt via HR several times asking for written justi=
fication and job responsibilities.  He has given me nothing but generic sta=
tements so he=92s being less than cooperative.  He bitched to Bari who rela=
yed to HR that he hasn=92t had an increase in his CF fee in 2 years.  I don=
=92t know if that is true.  I am checking.  Regardless, his concern for not=
 getting an increase for CF (if that=92s the case) in 2 years, as I have po=
inted out, is not a reason to arbitrarily just add costs to CF in the name =
of CVC.  CVC has apparently approved this but I will double check with her =
directly.  If we are going to increase him for CVC CF related work (and I a=
gree that makes sense) it shouldn=92t be arbitrary.  It should be based on =
the estimated time she expects for the duration of his 6 month contract inc=
orporating her actual time to date, as we do with CESC employees, to arrive=
 at a figure that has some basis.  I have also insisted that any increase b=
e accompanied by a time sheet outlining the hours he is spending on CF =96 =
CVC and non CVC to ensure that he is tracking and we are approving them.

Please advise on what you want me to do.  Thnx. LG
