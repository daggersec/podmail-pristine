AFSCME, AFT, SEIU and NEA Launch New Ad Campaign

Television and online ads ask Congress if they want to be remembered honora=
bly or by inflicting pain on millions of Americans

Washington, DC -The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Empl=
oyees (AFSCME), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the Service Empl=
oyees International Union (SEIU) and the National Education Association (NE=
A) today launched a new television ad aimed at the legacies of members of C=
ongress.

The spot, "Remembered," is a six figure television buy with a heavy online =
accompaniment that will air in the Washington, DC and other markets on Marc=
h 4. The ads single out Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Congressmen Ga=
ry Miller and Jeff Denham of California, Congressman Bob Gibbs of Ohio, Con=
gressman Daniel Webster of Florida, Congressman Tom Latham of Iowa and Cong=
ressman Dan Benishek of Michigan.

"Extremist tea-party Republicans have decided that 'slash and burn' will be=
 their congressional legacy - they'll apparently eviscerate any government =
services they can get their hands on, no matter how many jobs they burn alo=
ng the way. Allowing sequestration to go into effect is a complete abdicati=
on of their responsibility as lawmakers, and it is how history will remembe=
r them," said Chuck Loveless, AFSCME Federal Government Affairs Director.

"These ads will let the public know that Republican leaders are responsible=
 for failing to stop reckless automatic cuts that will hurt families and ou=
r economy. Approximately 1 million Americans could lose their jobs because =
congressional leaders refuse to close corporate tax loopholes - is that the=
 legacy that these members of Congress want?" added Peter Colavito, SEIU Di=
rector of Government Relations.

"Students will pay the price for congressional inaction," said Mary Kusler,=
 NEA Director of Government Relations. "The consequences of the budget cuts=
 - fewer educators, ballooning class sizes, no after-school tutoring - are =
keeping educators and students up at night. By pushing for deep cuts, the u=
nmistakable legacy of lawmakers is that they chose corporations over studen=
ts, cuts over jobs, and politics over compromise. Congress needs to find a =
responsible, balanced and permanent approach to avoid inflicting further pa=
in on students, families and communities while demanding the rich and corpo=
rations to pay their fair share."





"These cuts are not just numbers-every cut and every dollar has a real-life=
 consequence for our children, our families and for the people who teach, h=
eal and nurture them," said AFT President Randi Weingarten. "We are talking=
 about the difference between helping a child succeed and letting that chil=
d fall further behind in the classroom; making sure parents have affordable=
 and accessible childcare and early childhood education options; making sur=
e children and families have a roof over their head and food on the table; =
keeping frontline health providers on the job and providing lifesaving immu=
nizations to families; and keeping good jobs in our communities. Congress m=
ust not turn its back on the American people. We owe it to our children and=
 families to do everything we can to stop these irresponsible and dangerous=
 cuts from kicking in."

"Remembered" is the fourth TV spot by AFSCME, SEIU and NEA, and the first s=
ince the proverbial "fiscal cliff" was avoided.  The ad will run in Washing=
ton, DC, Cleveland, Los Angles, Sacramento, Orlando, Des Moines, and Traver=
se City media markets. Copies of the ad can be viewed at:

Script -
Announcer:     How will you be remembered Senator McConnell?

For serving honorably?

Or for inflicting pain on millions,

just to protect tax loopholes for corporations and the richest few?

By refusing to budge, you and Republican leaders

have guaranteed reckless, automatic cuts

that will devastate our troops, first responders, students, educators, fami=
lies, seniors,

and could destroy a million American jobs.

Is this how you want to be remembered, Senator McConnell?
###

appen. With members in hundreds of different occupations - from nurses to c=

dollar has a real-life consequence for our children, our families and for t=
he people who teach, heal and nurture them,&#8221; said
 AFT President Randi Weingarten. &#8220;We are talking about the difference=
 between helping a child succeed and letting that child fall further behind=
 in the classroom; making sure parents have affordable and accessible child=
care and early childhood education options;
 making sure children and families have a roof over their head and food on =
the table; keeping frontline health providers on the job and providing life=
saving immunizations to families; and keeping good jobs in our communities.=
 Congress must not turn its back
 on the American people. We owe it to our children and families to do every=
thing we can to stop these irresponsible and dangerous cuts from kicking in=
.&#8221;
