I kind of like the original progress language, but I like Dan's new
formulation on unlocking the potential of every American.  So I played
around with blending the two:

*And I was reminded in that moment that progress doesn't happen on its
own.  Progress doesn't happen by accident. Progress can't be made unless we
support the enormous potential of every human being.  And if we recognize
that if we unlock the full potential of every American, we can unlock the
full potential of America itself--**and progress will be ours.*
