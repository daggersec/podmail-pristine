John --

I have one message burned into my memory for everyone=20
who cares about the outcome of this year's presidential=20
election:

Respond quickly and powerfully to attacks from the other=20
side.

We've got to step up and fight back before it's too late:

https://donate.barackobama.com/August-Deadline

What makes 2012 different from when I ran for president=20
in 2004 is that the other side doesn't have to wait for an=20
outside group to come along with false attacks.=20

Consider this: Swift Boat Veterans for Truth spent about=20
$23 million on smear ads against me in 2004.=20

This year, the Romney campaign and super PACs have=20
promised to spend more than $1 billion.

Barack Obama has been a tremendous leader who has=20
moved our country forward in more ways than we even=20
probably now realize. He needs another four years=20
to get the job done.

If you tune in to the convention, you'll see that Mitt=20
Romney and his allies have no qualms about misleading voters=20
if it means defeating President Obama.

But their attacks won't work if enough people step up to=20
protect the President's record.=20

Don't let them get away with it.=20

The campaign faces a critical fundraising deadline=20
tomorrow night.=20

Please make a donation of $5 or more
today:

Thanks,

John Kerry
