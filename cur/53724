In April, McCain's platform was two roundtable discussions with business
leaders. This time, it was a town hall meeting in a packed high school
gymnasium, followed by a reception with big-ticket donors at a downtown
hotel.

Both visits came after McCain locked up the Republican nomination, and as
Democrats Barack Obama - McCain's main target Thursday - and Hillary Rodham
Clinton continue their battle.

McCain was to stay in Milwaukee overnight and hold a news conference today.

In a brief interview Thursday with the Journal Sentinel, McCain said state
voters will see a lot of him between now and November.

"We are going to compete here," McCain said. "I believe I can win here. I
know it's a big challenge. We are going to have to campaign hard here."

No Republican has won Wisconsin since Ronald Reagan in 1984, but President
Bush narrowly lost in 2000 and 2004. Republicans hope McCain's appeal to
independent voters will be the difference this time, and he sought to
underline that at various points Thursday.

State Democratic Party Chairman Joe Wineke said he is not concerned that the
lingering battle between Obama and Clinton has given McCain a leg up in the
state.

"We don't consider McCain as being here on a regular basis," Wineke said.
"We consider him coming in for a photo op and then leaving."

At both events Thursday, and in teleconferences earlier this week, opponents
criticized McCain as out of touch on the economy. As examples, they cited
his votes on trade issues and his support for extending Bush's tax cuts,
which he originally opposed.

Asked by the Journal Sentinel what in his experience or background qualifies
him more than Obama or Clinton on economic issues, McCain cited his record
of battling against wasteful spending and in support of tax cuts.

"As opposed to Senator Obama, who has no record," he said.
Focused on Obama

In contrast to the April visit, in which Obama and Clinton were scarcely
mentioned, Thursday's town hall meeting was peppered with criticism of
Obama. Most centered on foreign policy, seen as McCain's strength.

Indeed, McCain picked up the theme within minutes of taking the microphone
at Martin Luther High School, where about 1,000 people filled the gymnasium,
while others waited for McCain in an overflow room nearby.

After declaring "these are tough times in America and the world," McCain
said it is important to be willing to "listen and pay attention" to voters.
He then added, to applause, that candidates should be willing "to go to Iraq
and pay attention there to General Petraeus."

In recent days, McCain has hit Obama for not going to Iraq to review the
situation there or meeting with Gen. David Petraeus, the commander in Iraq
and architect of the "troop surge."

Obama has indicated he may go once the nomination is settled, but rejected
as a stunt McCain's offer to go along with him.

McCain later returned to the topic: "The point is he needs to go, and he
needs to go soon."

While the event was billed as an open forum, with no questions barred, the
crowd Thursday was clearly in McCain's corner.

The only boos came when Pat Hickey stood up and identified himself as a
Chicago resident and a Democrat. He quickly noted to applause: "There are a
lot of us supporting Senator McCain."

Hickey, a teacher at a private school in Chicago, asked McCain about school
choice, which McCain supports.

Other questions ranged from college affordability to the appointment of
Supreme Court justices. All brought familiar responses.

One woman questioned McCain on the war and its cost to the economy.

"It's succeeding," McCain said of the war. "I can look you in the eye and
tell you it's succeeding."

Thursday's visit included an evening fund-raiser in Milwaukee, one of
several held this week by the campaign in the days before the close of a
reporting period Saturday.

McCain has languished behind Obama and Clinton in fund raising, though the
national party has more in the bank than Democrats.

McCain told the Journal Sentinel he is "comfortable" with where he stands
now on the money front.

Asked in the interview about the new book by former White House press
secretary Scott McClellan, and whether its revelations gave him pause about
how the Iraq war was presented to the public, McCain said: "I would point
out that people ought to, if they have strong objections, their obligation
is to voice their objection at the time."

He also pledged to appoint as advisers and cabinet heads strong, independent
thinkers who are willing to challenge him and his views.

The fund-raiser at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center carried a $1,000 ticket
price, with a private reception for those who raised $10,000 or more. That
event was closed to the media.

State Assembly Speaker Mike Huebsch (R-West Salem) said about 175 people
attended, with McCain speaking for about 25 minutes, focusing on the war and
the economy.

At the town hall meeting and fund-raiser, McCain was greeted by protesters
who criticized him on the economy, the Iraq war, health care and other
matters.

More than 50 waited in the light rain outside Martin Luther High School.
Later, about a dozen protesters lined the sidewalk across from the Hilton,
the site of the fund-raiser.

One protester, with Citizen Action of Wisconsin, dressed up as a cow and
held a sign saying: "Why can't we have the same health care as Congress and
you?"

"We think Wisconsin has a huge opportunity to play a role in setting the
national agenda," said Robert Kraig, director of programs for the
organization.

Meanwhile, two men - part of the left-leaning group One Wisconsin Now - wore
suits and rubber masks that looked like Bush and McCain and danced to
bluegrass music. One held a sign that was the composite portrait of Bush and
McCain above the heading "McSame."

The various attacks are part of a concerted effort to paint McCain as a
carbon copy of Bush.

U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), who introduced McCain at the town hall
meeting, predicted the effort would fall flat.

"I don't think there's a lot of evidence for that, given that he is so
clearly his own man," Ryan said. "If you had a picture of an independent
thinker in the Senate in the dictionary, it would be John McCain."

<p>Other questions ranged from college affordability to the appointment of 
Supreme Court justices. All brought familiar responses. </p>
<p>One woman questioned McCain on the war and its cost to the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s succeeding,&quot; McCain said of the war. &quot;I can look you in the eye and 
tell you it&#39;s succeeding.&quot;</p>
<p>Thursday&#39;s visit included an evening fund-raiser in Milwaukee, one of several 
held this week by the campaign in the days before the close of a reporting 
period Saturday. </p>
<p>McCain has languished behind Obama and Clinton in fund raising, though the 
national party has more in the bank than Democrats.</p>
<p>McCain told the Journal Sentinel he is &quot;comfortable&quot; with where he stands now 
on the money front.</p>
<p>Asked in the interview about the new book by former White House press 
secretary Scott McClellan, and whether its revelations gave him pause about how 
the Iraq war was presented to the public, McCain said: &quot;I would point out that 
people ought to, if they have strong objections, their obligation is to voice 
their objection at the time.&quot;</p>
<p>He also pledged to appoint as advisers and cabinet heads strong, independent 
thinkers who are willing to challenge him and his views.</p>
<p>The fund-raiser at the Hilton Milwaukee City Center carried a $1,000 ticket 
price, with a private reception for those who raised $10,000 or more. That event 
was closed to the media.</p>
<p>State Assembly Speaker Mike Huebsch (R-West Salem) said about 175 people 
attended, with McCain speaking for about 25 minutes, focusing on the war and the 
economy.</p>
<p>At the town hall meeting and fund-raiser, McCain was greeted by protesters 
who criticized him on the economy, the Iraq war, health care and other 
matters.</p>
<p>More than 50 waited in the light rain outside Martin Luther High School. 
Later, about a dozen protesters lined the sidewalk across from the Hilton, the 
site of the fund-raiser.</p>
<p>One protester, with Citizen Action of Wisconsin, dressed up as a cow and held 
a sign saying: &quot;Why can&#39;t we have the same health care as Congress and you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We think Wisconsin has a huge opportunity to play a role in setting the 
national agenda,&quot; said Robert Kraig, director of programs for the 
organization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two men - part of the left-leaning group One Wisconsin Now - wore 
suits and rubber masks that looked like Bush and McCain and danced to bluegrass 
music. One held a sign that was the composite portrait of Bush and McCain above 
the heading &quot;McSame.&quot;</p>
<p>The various attacks are part of a concerted effort to paint McCain as a 
carbon copy of Bush. </p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville), who introduced McCain at the town hall 
meeting, predicted the effort would fall flat.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of evidence for that, given that he is so 
clearly his own man,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;If you had a picture of an independent thinker 
in the Senate in the dictionary, it would be John McCain.&quot;</p>
