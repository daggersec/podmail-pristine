John Stossel: 'I Don't Subscribe To Lou Dobbs-Kind Of Rants About Immigrant=
s Wrecking America'<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/21/john-stossel-lou-do=
bbs/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/21/john-stossel-lou-dobbs/

Latino and pro-immigrant activists have launched two campaigns, Drop Dobbs<=
http://www.dropdobbs.com/> and Basta Dobbs<http://bastadobbs.com/>, which a=
re aimed at pressuring CNN to "to hold Mr. Dobbs to journalistic standards<=
http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/florida/story/1243674.html>" or du=
mp him altogether. Perhaps sensing an opportunity, Fox News' senior vice pr=
esident for programming, Bill Shine, is trying to court Dobbs<http://thinkp=
rogress.org/2009/10/12/dobbs-fox-business/> over to Fox's business channel.

However, it seems not everyone at Fox News will be welcoming Dobbs with ope=
n arms. The network's newest addition, John Stossel, issued some scathing c=
riticisms of Dobbs in a radio interview<http://www.glennbeck.com/content/ar=
ticles/article/196/32213/> today with fellow Fox colleague Glenn Beck. Stos=
sel indicated that he doesn't support conservatives like Dobbs who rail on =
immigrants. Beck asked Stossel whether he is willing to "throw his vote awa=
y" and not vote for a Republican. Stossel firmly held that if "conservative=
 means stop all immigration and some other things that conservatives say," =
then he will not vote Republican:

STOSSEL: If it means the Lou Dobbs-kind of rants about immigrants wrecking =
America, I don't subscribe to that. I think immigrants by and large do good=
 things for America.

BECK: I think immigrants I think we need more immigrants, ones that want to=
 be Americans because those immigrants are the only ones that are reminding=
 us that we better get off our ass, we've got liberty here and we forget ab=
out it all the time.

Listen:

Lou Dobbs' rants include promoting the "Aztlan" conspiracy theory<http://ww=
w.splcenter.org/blog/2008/07/31/lou-dobbs-citing-extremists-again/> about M=
exican immigrants trying to reconquer portions of the American southwest, f=
alsely claiming that immigrants are bringing leprosy to the US<http://www.n=
ytimes.com/2007/05/30/business/30leonhardt.html>, and musing about whether =
President Obama himself is an "undocumented"<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/=
07/21/dobbs-obama-birth-certificate/> immigrant.
