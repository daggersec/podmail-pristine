Here is Murray's floor statement. Mulkulski does not appear to have made on=
e


Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the bankruptcy
reform legislation. This legislation offers an imperfect but fairly
balanced approach to reforming the bankruptcy system. Through the amendment
process we have improved the bill, but it could be more fair to all sectors
of our society. I am disappointed some good amendments that would have
improved the legislation were rejected. The bankruptcy reform legislation
that passed the House a couple of weeks ago is less friendly to individuals
in adverse circumstances not of their own doing. If this bankruptcy reform
bill is weakened in conference, I will have a hard time supporting it. I
will likely oppose a conference agreement that looks at all like the House
bill. In recent years, consumer bankruptcy filings have dramatically
increased. We debated bankruptcy reform in the last two Congresses. Those
discussions showed our desire to elevate personal responsibility in
consumer financial transactions; to prevent bankruptcy filings from being
used by consumers as a financial planning tool; and, to recapture the
stigma associated with a bankruptcy filing. It is clear the system is
broke, and bankruptcy reform is needed. I voted for bankruptcy reform in
both the 105th and 106th Congresses, and I plan to vote for this bill.
Despite these votes, I have reservations about how the unintended
consequences of this bill will affect the less fortunate. The bill will
have an enormous impact on women and child support. The largest growing
group of filers are women, usually single mothers. The bill=E2=80=99s overa=
ll
philosophy of pushing debtors from chapter 7 to chapter 13 will have an
unintended effect on women. They usually have fewer means and are more
susceptible to crafty creditors seeking to intimidate and reaffirm their
debts. They need the protection of chapter 7, but could be pushed into
chapter 13. Women will also be disadvantaged by provisions in this bill
that fail to prioritize domestic obligations. Under the provisions of this
bill, women will find themselves competing with powerful commercial
creditors for necessary resources, such as past-due child support, from
spouses who are in bankruptcy. It is unfair to place the critical needs of
families and single mothers trying to survive behind those of welloff
commercial creditors. Another problem with this bill is the new filing
requirements are very complex, which could result in unintended
discrimination against lower-income individuals and families. Many
low-income families don=E2=80=99t have the means to combat most creditors. =
Because
debtors must prove they are filing for legitimate reasons, those without
the means to combat powerful commercial interests will be placed at an
unfair disadvantage. I was also disappointed that the U.S. Senate failed to
adopt some very good amendments that would have significantly improved the
bill. Senator KOHL offered an amendment that would have limited the
practice of wealthy debtors shielding themselves from creditors in
bankruptcy behind State homestead exemption laws that allow them to shelter
large amounts of money in a new home. His amendment would have placed a
national cap on this exemption, and limited the abusive practice of
sheltering large amounts of money in large homes. I supported this needed
amendment, but it was rejected on the floor of the Senate. Several
amendments were also offered that would have restricted the marketing to
and use of credit cards by young people. Credit card companies are
aggressively marketing to young people, and many young people are getting
into massive debt. Companies should only be allowed to offer credit cards
to those who can pay for them. Finally, I am disappointed that amendments
were rejected that would have limited predatory lending practices. Some of
these predatory loans can have interest rates over 100%. I was pleased to
see that the bill included language to end the practice of using the
bankruptcy code to escape civil punishment for violence, intimidation or
threats against individuals using family planning services. This provision
was added in the Judiciary Committee and greatly improves the bill. It
ensures that those who violate the law cannot escape justice through the
bankruptcy laws. This critical provision of this bill that must not be
stripped or drastically changed in conference. Overall, this is a decent
bill that will improve on the current abuses of the bankruptcy system.
While I have concerns over many of this bill=E2=80=99s provisions, I hope t=
hey can
be dealt with in conference or in future legislation. This bill should be
strengthened in conference, not weakened as has happened to other versions
of bankruptcy legislation. I will closely examine a conference agreement
with this in mind before voting to send this legislation to the President.
