Dear John -

All of us fought hard for Tammy Duckworth's election last year, and she's =
constantly reminding us why.

She has a critical fundraising deadline tonight at midnight, and I hope =
you'll join me in rushing a contribution of $5 or more to her campaign =
right now.

Republican candidates are keeping a close eye on her fundraising numbers, =
and we have a chance to win this election right now, before it turns into =
a real contest. You can contribute to her campaign here:

http://action.votevets.org/tammy-duckworth

Did you see the House hearing this week where she challenged the =
contractor who was given preferential treatment for federal bids after he =
claimed service connected injury for something that happened while playing =
high school football?

"Does your foot hurt?" Congresswoman Duckworth asked the contractor.

"My feet hurt too. In fact, the balls of my feet burn continuously, and I =
feel like there is a nail being hammered into my heel right now ... I'm =
sorry that twisting your ankle in high school has now come back to hurt =
you in such a painful way, if also opportune for you to gain this status =
for your business."

In eight powerful minutes, she reminded us why there are few greater =
advocates for veterans and military families in all of Washington, D.C. We =
have to send her back.

Contribute to Tammy's campaign before her critical fundraising deadline =
tonight at midnight.

http://action.votevets.org/tammy-duckworth

For all Tammy has done for us, we have a duty to do our best to send her =
back for another term.

Let's get it done.

General (Ret.) Wesley Clark
