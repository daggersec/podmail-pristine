supporters, organize in your neighborhood, build our national grassroots =
organization, and stay in touch with the very latest campaign news.

Explore these resources yourself and forward this message to anyone you =
know who wants to get involved.

*MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW*

not registered to vote -- and they need someone to help make their voices =

Chicago, and since he declared his candidacy in 2007, a nationwide network =

online and in local communities. Here are some ways to get involved:

LOCAL GROUPS AND EVENTS

campaign into your own hands. Connect with other supporters in your area =
