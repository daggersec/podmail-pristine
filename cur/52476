John:

Didn't know if you knew about Bob Greenstein's wife's surgery for a brain t=
umor.  She was talking about hospice before surgery as first doctor gave th=
em a despairing prognosis but seemingly miraculous results from a different=
 surgeon.

Hope you are doing well.

Warmly,

Sarah

Elissa and Bob are hoping to return home midweek.  This is such a good stor=
y.

Just wanted to let Elissa=92s fans know she continues to make good progress=
.  She is now walking with a walker, has little pain, and is in very good s=
pirits.  In addition, the post-surgery MRI showed that the hydrocephalus sh=
e suffered from (fluid in the brain, which built up as a result of the pres=
sure from the tumor)  has gone away as a result of the successful surgery. =
 The medical staff repeatedly comments on how well she is doing and how wel=
l she looks, and they plan to release her from the hospital Monday or Tuesd=
ay.

She will still have a long recovery road, as is usually the case after a le=
ngthy brain surgery like this.  The tumor was on the swallowing nerve, and =
she can swallow now only with some difficulty.  As a result, she is on a re=
strictive diet of foods she can swallow.  She is doing swallowing exercises=
 10 times a day, and will need a fair amount of therapy for that when we re=
turn to DC.  She also doesn=92t have a good sense of balance while walking =
 -- which is common after a brain surgery like this =96 and needs a walker =
to walk safely.  Here, too, she will need physical therapy for some period =
of time after we return.  In both cases =96 with the walking and the swallo=
wing =96 she should return to normal with time and therapy.  And, she was v=
ery happy to hear that she won=92t need to live in a rehab facility; she ca=
n do the therapy as an outpatient or in our home.  (We=92re not yet sure wh=
ich.)

We are even more thankful this morning after a number of members of the hos=
pital=92s extraordinary neurosurgery team came by.  This is a teaching hosp=
ital, and they explained that Elissa=92s case had been used as a teaching e=
xample.  Her pre-surgery MRI was shown to the residents before the surgery,=
 and the reaction was , =93Wow, this tumor is not only large but in a very =
difficult location.  This is going to be a difficult and even dangerous sur=
gery.=94  Then, they told us, the residents were shown the post-surgery MRI=
, and the reaction was =93Beautiful.=94  This is apparently considered an e=
xample of how to do a great neurosurgery when the surgeons are confronted w=
ith a difficult challenge.

We are now hoping to return to our home in DC on Wednesday and to begin the=
 rehab stage of Elissa=92s recovery.

Bob
