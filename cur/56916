Q. Why was it important for the foundation that some foreign government don=
ations be allowed to continue after Hillary Clinton became secretary of sta=
te (i.e. those from governments that had been giving and then continued to =
do so at a steady pace, as well as new or increased donation that cleared a=
 state department review)? Why do foundation officials believe such donatio=
ns did not pose any conflicts of interest given Secretary Clinton's role, a=
s some have alleged?

=93As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, o=
rganizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addr=
essing critical global challenges in a meaningful way. When anyone contribu=
tes to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards Foundation programs that sav=
e lives. The majority of this support from governments is for specific, mul=
ti-year programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around =
the world and were underway well before Secretary Clinton took office.  It=
=92s hard to imagine someone arguing that funding should be cut off for the=
 more than 8 million people getting access to live-saving HIV/AIDS medicine=
 in more than 70 countries, the nearly 40,000 farmers in Malawi, Tanzania, =
and Rwanda trying to earn a better living or the reduction of 33,500 tons o=
f greenhouse gas emissions annually.=94
