Hi Chelsea,

Our current recommendation is slightly different from what your father appr=
oved after our last meeting.  He had approved Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday=
, which overlaps with Yom Kippur from sundown Tuesday until sundown Wednesd=
ay.  The new recommendation is to begin on Sunday and conclude before Yom K=
ippur begins on Tuesday at sundown, thus eliminating any conflict whatsoeve=
r.  Of course, I am happy to speak with him or you about this at your conve=
nience.

Best,

Bob

I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving.

Following our last exchange about what to do, if anything, in light of the =
conflict between Yom Kippur and the typical Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday ti=
ming of the 2012 Annual Meeting, we had approximately 15 conversations with=
 various friendly members -- Jewish, non-Jewish, corporate, individual, New=
 York based and non-New York based -- seeking their advice.  Based on this =
input, our recommendation is to begin the Annual Meeting on Sunday at midda=
y and conclude it late afternoon on Tuesday, before sundown.  This is logis=
tically feasible, given conversations with the Sheraton and Five Currents. =
 It would completely avoid any overlap between our meeting and the holiday,=
 and Sandy Berger believes we would be able to attract heads of state on Mo=
nday and Tuesday.  The trade-offs are increased labor costs due to weekend =
overtime and the loss of one evening event (unless we were to choose to hol=
d an event on Tuesday evening).  Among the three traditional evening events=
 -- the Clinton Global Citizen Awards ceremony, sponsor dinners on various =
topics and MoMA -- we would propose eliminating MoMa.  This would result in=
 savings of approximately $300,000 to offset increased weekend labor costs.

Chelsea, please review this new recommendation with your father and let us =
know your thoughts.

Best,

Bob
