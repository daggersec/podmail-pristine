Christine -

Just to make sure we're all on the same page, here is where I think we
are:

=20

Private Vet "Completed":

=20

Steinberg

S. Rice

Napolitano

=20

=46or these, since these were done before we agreed to involve Leslie K.
and Mike L. in a coordination role, I'd like to make sure they review
what we all reviewed to make sure there is nothing they would recommend
=66urther we probe.

=20

In Private Vetting Process:

=20

J. Jones

Geithner

Orszag

=20

Candidates in pre-Private Vetting Work-up:

=20

Holder

Blair

Lew

Locke

Tyson

Wright

Donovan

=20

Two of these are unlikely to progress to a full vet.  The next priority
will probably be an SBA candidate TBD soon.

=20

It's possible we'll want to do some early vetting on a couple of Deputy
candidates:

=20

=46arrell

Nora Johnson

=20

Then, resources permitting, we're likely to turn to:

=20

Sebelius

Daschle (maybe)

Kirk or Sims

Pritzker (We should discuss the work O'Melveny has done on her.)

=20

Does this all make sense=3F  Do you have any questions about it=3F  How many
teams can you field in total=3F  I have a sense Barack might want to
announce his whole cabinet before he leaves for Hawaii on the 20th.
