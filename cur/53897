Hi John,

I had a good talk with J. Palmieri on the conservative branding idea.=20

Here's another project CAP could consider doing and probably already is:
identify and share the elements of building a long-term succesful
majority coalition. The elements may include: having some real success,
building a broad majority that accepts some conflict internally, but
also a highly personal sense in each person/citizen of their connection
with a label. "I am an X because...". I'm not sure who else would do
that well.

Tom
