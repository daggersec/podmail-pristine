link follows:

http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/212920.php


Chuck Todd: Mike Murphy, lots of free advice, we'll see if Steve Schmidt and
the boys were watching. We'll find out on your blackberry. Tonight voters
will get their chance to hear from Sarah Palin and she will get the chance
to show voters she's the right woman for the job Up next, one man who's
already convinced and he'll us why Gov. Jon Huntsman.

(cut away)

Peggy Noonan: Yeah.

Mike Murphy: You know, because I come out of the blue swing state governor
world: Engler, Whitman, Tommy Thompson, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush. I mean, these
guys -- this is how you win a Texas race, just run it up. And it's not gonna
work. And --

PN: It's over.

MM: Still McCain can give a version of the Lieberman speech to do himself
some good.

CT: I also think the Palin pick is insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchinson, too.

PN: Saw Kay this morning.

CT: Yeah, she's never looked comfortable about this --

MM: They're all bummed out.

CT: Yeah, I mean is she really the most qualified woman they could have
turned to?

PN: The most qualified? No! I think they went for this -- excuse me--
political bullshit about narratives --

CT: Yeah they went to a narrative.

MM: I totally agree.

PN: Every time the Republicans do that, because that's not where they live
and it's not what they're good at, they blow it.

MM: You know what' sreally the worst thing about it? The greatness of McCain
is no cynicism, and this is cynical.

CT: This is cynical, and as you called it, gimmicky.

MM: Yeah.
