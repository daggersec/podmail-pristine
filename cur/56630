Bill,

Hope you are well and look forward to seeing on Monday.  I wanted to suggest
a name for your working group.  Deven Parekh. He has been working for the
campaign since last Feb.  He has helped with fund-raising and has been part
of the larger economic group.  I think he may also have some time to offer.
He is a partner with a VC firm called Insight Partners.  His email is
dparekh@insightpartners.com

take care,
Sonal
