Dear Profs. Leon and Podesta:

For my paper I would like to explore congressional justifications and
motivations for creating the House Select Committee on Assassinations
(HSCA) twelve years after the Warren Commission (which included members of
congress) investigated much of the same topic. I want to focus on how
HSCA's goals related to legislative proposals, redundancies and overlap of
HSCA and the Warren Commission, how their procedures differed, and how HSCA
served separations of powers concerns as a check on the executive branch
(investigating allegations of CIA involvement--Allen Dulles was on the
Warren Commission).

I look forward to meeting with one of you to discuss how to further narrow
my topic and to create a paper that is both interesting to read and to
research.

Thanks,

Peter
