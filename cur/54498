Dear Team Big Data,

I think of you often and hope you are all well!

I have been doing some writing since leaving DC, and my most recent column
is about my teenager's top ten most-hated things and why I make the kids
read privacy policies.

Since you've all met Sophie and because "Big DATA" makes an appearance on
her list, I thought I'd share the column with you. I am loving the teenage
years, truly. We are laying down odds that she will get over her hatred of
big data sooner than her aversion to seafood.

Find the column here
<http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2015/0513/Why-I-make-my-kids-read-privacy-policies>
.

I hope you'll come and visit us in California soon!  But, hurry, while
there's still some water left.

Best,

Nicole
