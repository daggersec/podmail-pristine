Professors Leon and Podesta,

As requested, I am providing my paper topic as well as a rough outline =
for discussion purposes.

Topic:  Why have the 9/11 Commission reforms for improved congressional =
oversight of the intelligence community not been implemented?   What =
utility would these reforms have provided between 2001 and 2014 =
(particularly with regard to the current NSA surveillance oversight =
issues)?  What, if any, reforms are now possible in light of changed =
circumstances?

Rough outline:

I.   Background
	A. Discuss 9/11 Commission origin and mandate (briefly)
	B. Discuss 9/11 Commission proposed reforms to Congressional =
Oversight

II. Congressional Action After the 9/11 Commission Report

	A. Historical look at inaction on the proposals
	B. Why did we get the set of reforms we got? =97 does the =
current Congress want the unimplemented reforms (specifically a single =
committee with unified budget oversight)?  Did a significant part of the =
107th Congress?  Did/does the 109th/112th/113th Congress have different =
goals than the 107th given parts of Congress had majority parties =
opposed to the President during these years?  Does/did Congress have a =
long-term view in mind regardless of the current occupants of =
Congress/the White House?

III. Reforms vs. Reality =97 What Would the Reforms Have Changed?

	A. Past case study =97 adoption of FISA Amendments Act (should =
Judiciary or Intelligence =93run the show=94)?
	B. Present-day case study =97  hearings and multiple =
investigations of NSA surveillance currently ongoing in multiple =
committees =97 note possible Congressional goals of these investigations =
and positives/negatives for Congress of holding investigation in one =
committee with broadened intelligence powers vs multiple hearings with =
conflicting personalities and goals

IV.  Conclusion =97 What Reforms are Now Possible in Light of Ten Years =
of Additional Experience?

Thanks!
