Thanks for all that you have done for me over the years. On each and every deadline you have given that extra effort, and that has put me where I am today: in position to run the strongest possible campaign for this Senate seat. You have heard me say this time and again, but tonight's deadline is critical, I only am able to raise the kind of funds necessary to communicate in NY with your help, and we have only a few opportunities left. Every donation counts from $4 to the maximum $4800.

Please go to www.kirstengillibrand.com/contribute to make your contribution online, or call Ross at 212-481-2010 today.

Thanks for helping me make this happen.

- Kirsten

PS: if you have reached your personal maximum, please share this message with your friends, family, and colleagues, tell them how much this race means to you.
