 John
We would love to have you or another top campaign official on the show
Sunday to discuss Hillary=E2=80=99s effort after the Saturday rally.
I hope you think we always treated you fairly on FNS.
And back in the 2008 primaries, the consensus was Fox treated Hillary more
fairly than any of the nets.
I know the former President is going on CNN Sunday.
We would like to have someone else to discuss the long campaign ahead.
Best=E2=80=94Chris

Ps=E2=80=94Perhaps we could do it on a DC to NY bus.
