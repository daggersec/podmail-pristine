Mr. Podesta,
I have a top rated radio show regarding ufology featuring typecasts I'm sure=
 you've heard of quoting the Hon. Paul T Helier, former defense minister of K=
endra, retired Senator Mike Gravel, retired congressmen Cook,  Apollo 14 ast=
ronaut Edgar Mitchell and all the top ufologists in the pursuit of truth and=
 disclosure. It would be an honor to interview you in light of your statemen=
ts that you made over 10 years ago as well as the most recent statements reg=
arding disclosure. Please consider doing so and we can do it for as long or a=
s short as you like either on phone or Skype and you could be pre-recorded o=
r live.
Best,
John Ilias J.D.
