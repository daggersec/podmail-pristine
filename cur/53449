The Average Joe's Proviso

Surprising numbers of white working-class voters will support the Democrat=
ic agenda=E2=80=94if Democrats promise to reform the government that would=
 carry it out.


By Stanley Greenberg
Democrats cannot win big or consistently enough=2C deep enough down the ti=
cket or broadly enough in the states=2C unless they run much stronger with=
 white working-class and downscale voters. That includes running better wi=
th white working-class swing voters=2C of course. But it also includes win=
ning more decisively with white unmarried women=2C a demographic group tha=
t=2C along with minority and Millennial voters=2C is integral to the Democ=
rats=E2=80=99 base in a growing American majority that I call the Rising A=
merican Electorate. Working-class whites and white unmarried women are bot=
h key to competing in the states where Republicans are pursuing a conserva=
tive governing agenda unchecked and to keeping Democratic voters engaged i=
n both presidential and off-year elections.

When the economy crashed in 2008=2C Obama won white unmarried women by a w=
hopping 20 points (60 to 40 percent) and came within 6 points of winning w=
hite working-class women (47 to 53 percent)=2C though he still lost white=
 male working-class voters by 24 points and got only 37 percent of the whi=
te working-class vote. But the size of the Democrats=E2=80=99 prospective=
 national majority was clearly diminished by what then happened with these=
 downscale=2C mostly working-class voters. In his reelection in 2012=2C Ob=
ama won white unmarried women by just a 4-point margin=2C and in the 2014=
 midterms=2C Democrats almost split their votes with the Republicans=2C ge=
tting only a 2-point margin. Hillary Clinton is just running even with the=
 prospective Republican candidates among white unmarried women right now.

After the 2008 wave election that rejected the policies of George W. Bush=
=2C white working-class women quickly dialed down their Democratic support=
 to about 38 percent=2C working-class men to 33 percent. That holds true f=
or Clinton against her potential Republican rivals. There remains an undec=
ided bloc that could allow Clinton to run stronger than this suggests=2C t=
hough she clearly has inherited the problem with struggling=2C downscale w=
hite working-class voters=2C both inside and outside the Democrats=E2=80=
=99 base.

These voters=2C as we shall see=2C are open to an expansive Democratic eco=
nomic agenda=E2=80=94to more benefits for child care and higher education=
=2C to tax hikes on the wealthy=2C to investment in infrastructure spendin=
g=2C and to economic policies that lead employers to boost salaries for mi=
ddle- and working-class Americans=2C especially women. Yet they are only r=
eady to listen when they think that Democrats understand their deeply held=
 belief that politics has been corrupted and government has failed. Champi=
oning reform of government and the political process is the price of admis=
sion with these voters. These white working-class and downscale voters are=
 acutely conscious of the growing role of big money in politics and of a g=
overnment that works for the 1 percent=2C not them.

It is possible that their cynicism about government is grounded in a funda=
mental individualism and long-standing American skepticism about intrusive=
 government. And it also may be rooted in a race-conscious aversion to gov=
ernment spending that they believe fosters dependency and idleness=E2=80=
=94the principal critique of today=E2=80=99s conservative Republicans. If=
 that is the prevailing dynamic=2C no appeal=2C no matter how compelling=
=2C would bring increased support for government activism.

Yet the white working-class and downscale voters in our surveys do support=
 major parts of a progressive=2C activist agenda=2C particularly when a De=
mocratic candidate boldly attacks the role of money and special interests=
 dominating government and aggressively promotes reforms to ensure that av=
erage citizens get both their say and their money=E2=80=99s worth. These f=
indings came out of innovative research conducted in partnership with Page=
 Gardner=E2=80=99s Women=E2=80=99s Voices Women Vote Action Fund (http://w=
ww.wvwvaf.org/?utm_source=3DDCorps+General+List&utm_campaign=3Ddbf5a52863-=

avid Donnelly=E2=80=99s Every Voice (http://www.everyvoice.org/about-us/ev=

bf5a52863-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D&ct=3Dt%28The+Average+Joe%27s+Proviso%29) .

In recent years=2C too many Democrats have presumed that the white working=
 class is out of the party=E2=80=99s reach and that talk of reforming gove=
rnment and the political process simply does not move voters. My contentio=
n is that both of those presumptions are wrong. An agenda of reform is the=
 key to Democrats winning the greater share of white working-class and unm=
arried women votes that will give the party the majorities it needs to gov=
ern.

The macro economy is recovering and job growth is robust=2C yet this hasn=
=E2=80=99t altered the structural changes that leave all working-class Ame=
ricans struggling to keep up with the cost of living or struggling just to=
 afford something extra. This includes key segments of the new American ma=
jority=2C like white unmarried women. They are more likely to be raising c=
hildren on their own; a majority never attained a four-year college degree=
; and their median income of $37=2C410 is $13=2C607 below the national med=
ian. It also includes broad swaths of the white working class=2C both wome=
n and men.

Both groups are almost equally frustrated with the direction of the countr=
y=2C the political class=2C and government. A striking three-quarters of w=
hite working-class Americans now think that the country is on the wrong tr=
ack=2C as do two-thirds of white unmarried women from all income levels. A=
 daunting 71 percent of white working-class men and 64 percent of white wo=
rking-class women disapprove of the job Obama is doing=2C but so do 55 per=
cent of white unmarried women.

Nearly 60 percent of white unmarried women say that the path to the middle=
 class is blocked because jobs don=E2=80=99t pay enough to live on=2C and=
 they reject the idea that you can still reach the middle class in tough t=
imes through hard work. Unmarried women are the heart of the new majority=
=2C yet unmarried white women feel stymied more than any other section of=
 the Rising American Electorate. And they look very similar in attitude to=
 white working-class women=2C 56 percent of whom say they are prevented fr=
om reaching the middle class. A small plurality of white working-class men=
 still thinks hard work can get you there. So the white working-class wome=
n and the unmarried women evidently are struggling more and feel more hind=
ered than white working-class men in this low-wage economy.

Given the huge economic changes and challenges facing working people=2C we=
 should not be surprised that they think government has not been part of t=
he solution for them. In the spring of 2010=E2=80=94a year into the implem=
entation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act=E2=80=94Democracy C=
orps asked voters=2C =E2=80=9CWho are the main beneficiaries of the Econom=
ic Recovery Act?=E2=80=9D Almost half=2C 45 percent=2C said that unemploye=
d Americans benefited a lot or some from the act=2C and a lesser amount=2C=
 34 percent=2C said the middle class was benefiting. But three-quarters sa=
id the big banks and financial institutions were the beneficiaries=2C and=
 50 percent said they benefited a lot=E2=80=94more than eight times the nu=
mber who said that for the middle class. White working-class men were part=
icularly outraged=2C with six in ten saying that the banks benefited a lot=
=2E White working-class respondents were the ones most likely to say that th=
ey themselves were not benefiting: just one in five said they benefited fr=
om the
Economic Recovery Act.

After that=2C they watched the Supreme Court rally to protect the free spe=
ech rights of corporations and saw the flood of unregulated and secret cam=
paign donations and TV advertising. This has led to a new level of public=
 revulsion with politics and support for fundamental reforms. Super PACs a=
re not arcane institutions. They are known by more than half of the voters=
 and detested: seven times as many people react to them negatively as posi=
tively. The public knew that the Citizens United Supreme Court decision wa=
s a sham from the outset and very quickly concluded that the new fund-rais=
ing regime of big donors and secret money damaged something fundamental. T=
wo-thirds were convinced that the system =E2=80=9Cundermines democracy=E2=
=80=9D=E2=80=9454 percent believed that strongly.

For the public=2C the consequences of this legalized system of secret and=
 unlimited donations are self-evident. When they are asked which of the fo=
llowing has the most influence on members of Congress=2C the public puts=
 =E2=80=9Cspecial interest groups and lobbyists=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ccamp=
aign contributors=E2=80=9D in a league of their own: 59 percent say the fi=
rst have the most influence=2C and 46 percent the second. Those groups are=
 seen to wield the influence in Washington=2C as political parties pale in=
 power: just 29 percent choose party leaders as most influential. And when=
 it comes to the =E2=80=9Cviews of constituents=2C=E2=80=9D only 15 percen=
t say they matter the most.

While white working-class women are more likely to see campaign contributo=
rs and party leaders as having the most influence=2C white working-class m=
en again cite special interest groups and lobbyists: amazingly=2C 60 perce=
nt say these groups hold the cards in Washington.

Why=2C then=2C would working-class voters and lower-income Americans turn=
 to government to bring change? They are not crazy. Everything they have s=
een says that government is gridlocked and is bought and paid for by big d=
onors and special interests=2C and politicians rig the system for the most=
 irresponsible companies. Special interests push up spending and lobby for=
 special tax breaks for themselves=2C and government spends with little th=
ought for the average citizen.

Democrats have run so poorly with white working-class and downscale voters=
 since 2008 that some observers have concluded that Democrats are blocked=
 structurally. Democratic identification with the new American majority pr=
esumably puts these white working-class voters out of reach. Trying to win=
 these voters is seen as a fool=E2=80=99s errand.

That conclusion is misguided. First=2C as we have seen=2C many white downs=
cale voters in the Democratic base hold similar views about the economy an=
d government as do white working-class swing voters. Second=2C the conclus=
ion presumes that the white working class is still largely employed in ind=
ustrial occupations=2C while=2C in fact=2C large portions are lower-paid=
=2C service-sector employees=2C a majority of whom are women. And third=2C=
 the belief that the white working class is increasingly out of reach for=
 Democrats is to a large degree a story of the South and the rural Conserv=
ative Heartland=2C not the story of white working-class voters in the rest=
 of the country. Democrats still can and do compete for white working-clas=
s voters in three-quarters of the country.

A majority=E2=80=9454 percent=E2=80=94of white non-college-educated voters=
 are women. Job growth today mostly comes for customer service professiona=
ls=2C retail and sales clerks=2C home health aides=2C and fast food worker=
s=E2=80=94professions dominated by women=E2=80=94and the average wage for=
 those jobs is dramatically below the median income. These women struggle=
 with jobs that don=E2=80=99t pay enough to live on=2C manage employment a=
nd kids without help=2C suffer from the enduring gender pay gap=2C and oft=
en have to piece together multiple jobs to get to a decent income. They ge=
t by without much help balancing work and family obligations from either b=
usinesses or government. They may notice that things are quite different f=
or the 1 percent=2C which gets all the help it needs.

The 19 percent of the electorate comprised of white non-college-educated w=
omen is indeed very open to government helping working families with educa=
tion and college affordability and building a more secure safety net. Thes=
e lower-income women want their money=E2=80=99s worth=2C but they are very=
 much within the Democratic Party=E2=80=99s reach.

The hurdles to reaching the white working class look so daunting because o=
f the success of Republicans in building up huge margins with those voters=
 in the South=2C the plains=2C and the Rocky Mountain region. Obama won on=
ly 25 percent of white non-college-educated voters in the South and 33 per=
cent in the Mountain West. And Democrats have been losing ground in politi=
cal support and party identification with the most religiously observant=
=2C racially conscious=2C and rural white working-class voters in those re=
gions. Voter attitudes about blacks and Hispanics=2C the role of women=2C=
 traditional marriage=2C abortion=2C and religion there pose very differen=
t challenges that do indeed put most of these voters out of reach.

It is important to remember=2C however=2C that three-quarters of American=
 voters live outside these conservative Republican strongholds. In the res=
t of the country=2C the battle for the swing white working-class and downs=
cale voters is very much alive. In the East and the Midwest=2C support for=
 the two parties is split down the middle=2C and since 2000 this identific=
ation with the two parties has remained very stable. On election day in 20=
12=2C Obama won 40 percent of the white non-college-educated voters outsid=
e the Republicans=E2=80=99 regional bases. That number still poses a probl=
em=2C but it would not take major gains with these voters to change the De=
mocrat Party=E2=80=99s fortunes in these areas.

Voters in the midterm elections of 2014 were ready to rally to candidates=
 who would attack this corrupt system. Precious few candidates understood=
 that voters had moved far ahead of the politicians.

Three-quarters of voters in the twelve most competitive Senate battlegroun=
d states in 2014=E2=80=94states flooded with campaign money=E2=80=94suppor=
t a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling. Three=
 in five of those voters support =E2=80=9Ca plan to overhaul campaign spen=
ding by getting rid of big donations and allowing only small donations to=
 candidates=2C matched by taxpayer funds.=E2=80=9D The American citizenry=
 has become progressively more supportive of barring big donors and corpor=
ate mega-contributions and using public funds to empower small donations.=
 Even in the face of charges that public funding is =E2=80=9Cwelfare for p=
oliticians=2C=E2=80=9D voters in the midterms said that they would rally t=
o a candidate who argues that =E2=80=9Cwe need a government of=2C by and f=
or the people=E2=80=94not government bought and paid for by wealthy donors=
=2E=E2=80=9D

Democrats lost badly in the Senate battleground states=2C located primaril=
y in the South and most rural areas of the country. Yet one of the most ef=
fective campaign attacks we tested linked big donations to politicians adv=
ancing the interests of wealthy donors who used unlimited=2C secret money=
 to make sure that billionaires=E2=80=99 and CEOs=E2=80=99 taxes remained=
 artificially low and their loopholes stayed protected.

The power of this attack comes from the central role of the corrupt Washin=
gton and Wall Street nexus in the new economy. While working-class men str=
uggled=2C the Republican candidate was helping government work for big cor=
porations and special interests.

When Democracy Corps tested this attack in Louisiana=2C North Carolina=2C=
 Georgia=2C Iowa=2C Colorado=2C and the other Senate battleground states=
=2C it was among the most powerful attacks on the Republican candidates.

Of course=2C none of the Democratic candidates ran that ad.

We asked presidential-year voters to react to a battery of bold initiative=
s that could form a Democratic economic agenda for 2016. They include poli=
cies to protect Medicare and Social Security=2C investments in infrastruct=
ure to modernize the country=2C a cluster of policies to help working fami=
lies with child care and paid leave=2C and new efforts to ensure equal pay=
 and family leave for women. Voters embraced these initiatives=2C and they=
 tested more strongly than a Republican alternative.

Yet most important for our purposes are the results for white unmarried wo=
men and working-class women. These groups both put a =E2=80=9Cstreamline g=
overnment=E2=80=9D initiative ahead of everything except protecting Social=
 Security and Medicare. They want to =E2=80=9Cstreamline government and re=
duce waste and bureaucracy to make sure every dollar spent is a dollar spe=
nt serving people=2C not serving government.=E2=80=9D They gave even great=
er importance than white working-class men to streamlining government. For=
 these women=2C being on the edge means feeling more strongly that governm=
ent should pinch pennies and start working for them.

At the outset of the 2016 presidential election cycle=2C I tested a middle=
-class economic narrative that ended with a call for an economy that works=
 for working people and the middle class again. The narrative begins with=
 the recognition that people are drowning=2C jobs don=E2=80=99t pay enough=
=2C and people are struggling to pay the bills despite all their hard work=
=2E At the heart of the narrative is an intention to use government to help=
=2C including assistance with making college and child care affordable and=
 ensuring equal pay for working women. It also includes tax credits for lo=
w-wage workers and the middle class and a promise to protect Medicare and=
 Social Security.

When we tested this narrative among likely 2016 voters in January 2015 in=
 a poll conducted for Democracy Corps and the Women=E2=80=99s Voices Women=
 Vote Action Fund=2C over 70 percent of presidential-year voters said that=
 they found it convincing=2C and almost 40 percent responded with intense=
 support. More important in the context of the national elections=2C that=
 narrative tested about 20 points more convincing to voters than an altern=
ative conservative economic narrative that faulted Democrats for leaving s=
o many people struggling and offered instead a small government route to g=
rowth; it similarly outperformed a conservative Tea Party narrative that p=
ushed back against government overreach.

This narrative speaks to all members of the Rising American Electorate. Fu=
lly 78 percent of the growing coalition of young people=2C unmarried women=
=2C and minorities said the narrative was convincing=E2=80=94dramatically=
 higher than the vote share they gave to Democrats even in the best years.=
 Unmarried women=2C in particular=2C were moved. A stunning eight in ten f=
ound it convincing=2C and nearly half chose =E2=80=9Cvery convincing.=E2=
=80=9D The narrative got its strongest generational support from the Mille=
nnials=2C but it was nearly matched by the enthusiasm of the Baby Boomers.

The middle-class economic narrative got the attention of white working-cla=
ss voters=2C too. They have not been great fans of government activism in=
 recent decades=2C to put it mildly=2C and they have only been giving Demo=
crats about a third of their votes. Yet an impressive 71 percent of white=
 non-college-educated women embrace this narrative when it is presented to=
 them; 41 percent do so strongly. In a head-to-head comparison=2C white wo=
rking-class women find the Democrats=E2=80=99 middle-class economic narrat=
ive slightly more convincing than the Republicans=E2=80=99 conservative=2C=
 small government economic narrative. While white working-class men respon=
ded less intensely to this middle-class economic narrative=2C 62 percent s=
till found it convincing=E2=80=94and that is only 5 points below their sup=
port for the competing conservative small government narrative.

Independents also gave a slight edge (60 to 55 percent) to the Democrats=
=E2=80=99 middle-class economic narrative that places government activism=
 on behalf of the working and middle class at its core.

What really strengthens and empowers the progressive economic narrative=2C=
 however=2C is a commitment to reform politics and government. That may se=
em ironic or contradictory=2C since the narrative calls for a period of go=
vernment activism. But=2C of course=2C it does make sense: Why would you e=
xpect government to act on behalf of the ordinary citizen when it is clear=
ly dominated by special interests? Why would you expect people who are fin=
ancially on the edge=2C earning flat or falling wages and paying a fair am=
ount of taxes and fees=2C not to be upset about tax money being wasted or=
 channeled to individuals and corporations vastly more wealthy and powerfu=
l than themselves?

We have arrived at a tipping point at the outset of the 2016 election cycl=
e=2C where the demand to reform government is equal to or stronger than th=
e demand to reform the economy. More accurately=2C reform can make it poss=
ible to use governmental policies to help the middle class. In short=2C it=
 is reform first.

In a straight test=2C the presidential electorate is as enthusiastic about=
 a reform narrative as the middle-class economic one. The first part of th=
e narrative focuses on big business and special interests that give big mo=
ney to politicians and then use lobbyists to win special tax breaks and sp=
ecial laws that cost the country billions. The second part emphasizes how=
 special interests and the bureaucracy protect out-of-date programs that d=
on=E2=80=99t work. The bottom line of the narrative is that government ref=
orm would free up money so the government could work for middle-class and=
 working families rather than big donors.

Most importantly=2C when voters hear the reform narrative first=2C they ar=
e then dramatically more open to the middle-class economic narrative that=
 calls for government activism in response to America=E2=80=99s problems.

Among voters who heard the reform message first=2C 43 percent describe the=
 middle-class economic narrative as very convincing=E2=80=9411 points high=
er than when they hear the economic message first. Among white working-cla=
ss voters in particular=2C this effect produced a 13-point jump in intensi=
ty for the Democrats=E2=80=99 middle-class economic message (from 27 to 40=
 percent).

Clearly=2C these white working-class and downscale voters are open to a bo=
ld Democratic agenda and prefer it to a conservative Republican vision for=
 the country. To win their support=2C however=2C voters are demanding=2C w=
ith growing ferocity=2C that Democrats battle against America=E2=80=99s co=
rrupted politics and for a government that really works for the average ci=
tizen. This is the route to a stronger result with white working-class and=
 unmarried women voters and more sustainable victories for Democrats=2C in=
 2016 and beyond.

Democrats cannot win big or consistently enough=2C deep enough down the ti=
cket or broadly enough in the states=2C unless they run much stronger with=
 white working-class and downscale voters. That includes running better wi=
th white working-class swing voters=2C of course. But it also includes win=
ning more decisively with white unmarried women=2C a demographic group tha=
t=2C along with minority and Millennial voters=2C is integral to the Democ=
rats&rsquo; base in a growing American majority that I call the Rising Ame=
rican Electorate. Working-class whites and white unmarried women are both=
 key to competing in the states where Republicans are pursuing a conservat=
ive governing agenda unchecked and to keeping Democratic voters engaged in=
 both presidential and off-year elections.<br>
<br>
When the economy crashed in 2008=2C Obama won white unmarried women by a w=
hopping 20 points (60 to 40 percent) and came within 6 points of winning w=
hite working-class women (47 to 53 percent)=2C though he still lost white=
 male working-class voters by 24 points and got only 37 percent of the whi=
te working-class vote. But the size of the Democrats&rsquo; prospective na=
tional majority was clearly diminished by what then happened with these do=
wnscale=2C mostly working-class voters. In his reelection in 2012=2C Obama=
 won white unmarried women by just a 4-point margin=2C and in the 2014 mid=
terms=2C Democrats almost split their votes with the Republicans=2C gettin=
g only a 2-point margin. Hillary Clinton is just running even with the pro=
spective Republican candidates among white unmarried women right now.<br>
<br>
After the 2008 wave election that rejected the policies of George W. Bush=
=2C white working-class women quickly dialed down their Democratic support=
 to about 38 percent=2C working-class men to 33 percent. That holds true f=
or Clinton against her potential Republican rivals. There remains an undec=
ided bloc that could allow Clinton to run stronger than this suggests=2C t=
hough she clearly has inherited the problem with struggling=2C downscale w=
hite working-class voters=2C both inside and outside the Democrats&rsquo;=
 base.<br>
<br>
These voters=2C as we shall see=2C are open to an expansive Democratic eco=
nomic agenda&mdash;to more benefits for child care and higher education=2C=
 to tax hikes on the wealthy=2C to investment in infrastructure spending=
=2C and to economic policies that lead employers to boost salaries for mid=
dle- and working-class Americans=2C especially women. Yet they are only re=
ady to listen when they think that Democrats understand their deeply held=
 belief that politics has been corrupted and government has failed. Champi=
oning reform of government and the political process is the price of admis=
sion with these voters. These white working-class and downscale voters are=
 acutely conscious of the growing role of big money in politics and of a g=
overnment that works for the 1 percent=2C not them.<br>
<br>
It is possible that their cynicism about government is grounded in a funda=
mental individualism and long-standing American skepticism about intrusive=
 government. And it also may be rooted in a race-conscious aversion to gov=
ernment spending that they believe fosters dependency and idleness&mdash;t=
he principal critique of today&rsquo;s conservative Republicans. If that i=
s the prevailing dynamic=2C no appeal=2C no matter how compelling=2C would=
 bring increased support for government activism.<br>
<br>
Yet the white working-class and downscale voters in our surveys do support=
 major parts of a progressive=2C activist agenda=2C particularly when a De=
mocratic candidate boldly attacks the role of money and special interests=
 dominating government and aggressively promotes reforms to ensure that av=
erage citizens get both their say and their money&rsquo;s worth. These fin=
dings came out of innovative research conducted in partnership with Page G=

<br>
In recent years=2C too many Democrats have presumed that the white working=
 class is out of the party&rsquo;s reach and that talk of reforming govern=
ment and the political process simply does not move voters. My contention=
 is that both of those presumptions are wrong. An agenda of reform is the=
 key to Democrats winning the greater share of white working-class and unm=
arried women votes that will give the party the majorities it needs to gov=
ern.<br>
<br>
The macro economy is recovering and job growth is robust=2C yet this hasn&=
rsquo;t altered the structural changes that leave all working-class Americ=
ans struggling to keep up with the cost of living or struggling just to af=
ford something extra. This includes key segments of the new American major=
ity=2C like white unmarried women. They are more likely to be raising chil=
dren on their own; a majority never attained a four-year college degree; a=
nd their median income of $37=2C410 is $13=2C607 below the national median=
=2E It also includes broad swaths of the white working class=2C both women a=
nd men.<br>
<br>
Both groups are almost equally frustrated with the direction of the countr=
y=2C the political class=2C and government. A striking three-quarters of w=
hite working-class Americans now think that the country is on the wrong tr=
ack=2C as do two-thirds of white unmarried women from all income levels. A=
 daunting 71 percent of white working-class men and 64 percent of white wo=
rking-class women disapprove of the job Obama is doing=2C but so do 55 per=
cent of white unmarried women.<br>
<br>
Nearly 60 percent of white unmarried women say that the path to the middle=
 class is blocked because jobs don&rsquo;t pay enough to live on=2C and th=
ey reject the idea that you can still reach the middle class in tough time=
s through hard work. Unmarried women are the heart of the new majority=2C=
 yet unmarried white women feel stymied more than any other section of the=
 Rising American Electorate. And they look very similar in attitude to whi=
te working-class women=2C 56 percent of whom say they are prevented from r=
eaching the middle class. A small plurality of white working-class men sti=
ll thinks hard work can get you there. So the white working-class women an=
d the unmarried women evidently are struggling more and feel more hindered=
 than white working-class men in this low-wage economy.<br>
<br>
Given the huge economic changes and challenges facing working people=2C we=
 should not be surprised that they think government has not been part of t=
he solution for them. In the spring of 2010&mdash;a year into the implemen=
tation of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act&mdash;Democracy Corps=
 asked voters=2C &ldquo;Who are the main beneficiaries of the Economic Rec=
overy Act?&rdquo; Almost half=2C 45 percent=2C said that unemployed Americ=
ans benefited a lot or some from the act=2C and a lesser amount=2C 34 perc=
ent=2C said the middle class was benefiting. But three-quarters said the b=
ig banks and financial institutions were the beneficiaries=2C and 50 perce=
nt said they benefited a lot&mdash;more than eight times the number who sa=
id that for the middle class. White working-class men were particularly ou=
traged=2C with six in ten saying that the banks benefited a lot. White wor=
king-class respondents were the ones most likely to say that they themselv=
es were not benefiting: just one in five said they benefited from the Econ=
omic Recovery Act.<br>
<br>
After that=2C they watched the Supreme Court rally to protect the free spe=
ech rights of corporations and saw the flood of unregulated and secret cam=
paign donations and TV advertising. This has led to a new level of public=
 revulsion with politics and support for fundamental reforms. Super PACs a=
re not arcane institutions. They are known by more than half of the voters=
 and detested: seven times as many people react to them negatively as posi=
tively. The public knew that the <em>Citizens United</em> Supreme Court de=
cision was a sham from the outset and very quickly concluded that the new=
 fund-raising regime of big donors and secret money damaged something fund=
amental. Two-thirds were convinced that the system &ldquo;undermines democ=
racy&rdquo;&mdash;54 percent believed that strongly.<br>
<br>
For the public=2C the consequences of this legalized system of secret and=
 unlimited donations are self-evident. When they are asked which of the fo=
llowing has the most influence on members of Congress=2C the public puts &=
ldquo;special interest groups and lobbyists&rdquo; and &ldquo;campaign con=
tributors&rdquo; in a league of their own: 59 percent say the first have t=
he most influence=2C and 46 percent the second. Those groups are seen to w=
ield the influence in Washington=2C as political parties pale in power: ju=
st 29 percent choose party leaders as most influential. And when it comes=
 to the &ldquo;views of constituents=2C&rdquo; only 15 percent say they ma=
tter the most.<br>
<br>
While white working-class women are more likely to see campaign contributo=
rs and party leaders as having the most influence=2C white working-class m=
en again cite special interest groups and lobbyists: amazingly=2C 60 perce=
nt say these groups hold the cards in Washington.<br>
<br>
Why=2C then=2C would working-class voters and lower-income Americans turn=
 to government to bring change? They are not crazy. Everything they have s=
een says that government is gridlocked and is bought and paid for by big d=
onors and special interests=2C and politicians rig the system for the most=
 irresponsible companies. Special interests push up spending and lobby for=
 special tax breaks for themselves=2C and government spends with little th=
ought for the average citizen.<br>
<br>
Democrats have run so poorly with white working-class and downscale voters=
 since 2008 that some observers have concluded that Democrats are blocked=
 structurally. Democratic identification with the new American majority pr=
esumably puts these white working-class voters out of reach. Trying to win=
 these voters is seen as a fool&rsquo;s errand.<br>
<br>
That conclusion is misguided. First=2C as we have seen=2C many white downs=
cale voters in the Democratic base hold similar views about the economy an=
d government as do white working-class swing voters. Second=2C the conclus=
ion presumes that the white working class is still largely employed in ind=
ustrial occupations=2C while=2C in fact=2C large portions are lower-paid=
=2C service-sector employees=2C a majority of whom are women. And third=2C=
 the belief that the white working class is increasingly out of reach for=
 Democrats is to a large degree a story of the South and the rural Conserv=
ative Heartland=2C not the story of white working-class voters in the rest=
 of the country. Democrats still can and do compete for white working-clas=
s voters in three-quarters of the country.<br>
<br>
A majority&mdash;54 percent&mdash;of white non-college-educated voters are=
 women. Job growth today mostly comes for customer service professionals=
=2C retail and sales clerks=2C home health aides=2C and fast food workers&=
mdash;professions dominated by women&mdash;and the average wage for those=
 jobs is dramatically below the median income. These women struggle with j=
obs that don&rsquo;t pay enough to live on=2C manage employment and kids w=
ithout help=2C suffer from the enduring gender pay gap=2C and often have t=
o piece together multiple jobs to get to a decent income. They get by with=
out much help balancing work and family obligations from either businesses=
 or government. They may notice that things are quite different for the 1=
 percent=2C which gets all the help it needs.<br>
<br>
The 19 percent of the electorate comprised of white non-college-educated w=
omen is indeed very open to government helping working families with educa=
tion and college affordability and building a more secure safety net. Thes=
e lower-income women want their money&rsquo;s worth=2C but they are very m=
uch within the Democratic Party&rsquo;s reach.<br>
<br>
The hurdles to reaching the white working class look so daunting because o=
f the success of Republicans in building up huge margins with those voters=
 in the South=2C the plains=2C and the Rocky Mountain region. Obama won on=
ly 25 percent of white non-college-educated voters in the South and 33 per=
cent in the Mountain West. And Democrats have been losing ground in politi=
cal support and party identification with the most religiously observant=
=2C racially conscious=2C and rural white working-class voters in those re=
gions. Voter attitudes about blacks and Hispanics=2C the role of women=2C=
 traditional marriage=2C abortion=2C and religion there pose very differen=
t challenges that do indeed put most of these voters out of reach.<br>
<br>
It is important to remember=2C however=2C that three-quarters of American=
 voters live outside these conservative Republican strongholds. In the res=
t of the country=2C the battle for the swing white working-class and downs=
cale voters is very much alive. In the East and the Midwest=2C support for=
 the two parties is split down the middle=2C and since 2000 this identific=
ation with the two parties has remained very stable. On election day in 20=
12=2C Obama won 40 percent of the white non-college-educated voters outsid=
e the Republicans&rsquo; regional bases. That number still poses a problem=
=2C but it would not take major gains with these voters to change the Demo=
crat Party&rsquo;s fortunes in these areas.<br>
<br>
Voters in the midterm elections of 2014 were ready to rally to candidates=
 who would attack this corrupt system. Precious few candidates understood=
 that voters had moved far ahead of the politicians.<br>
<br>
Three-quarters of voters in the twelve most competitive Senate battlegroun=
d states in 2014&mdash;states flooded with campaign money&mdash;support a=
 constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United ruling. Three in=
 five of those voters support &ldquo;a plan to overhaul campaign spending=
 by getting rid of big donations and allowing only small donations to cand=
idates=2C matched by taxpayer funds.&rdquo; The American citizenry has bec=
ome progressively more supportive of barring big donors and corporate mega=
-contributions and using public funds to empower small donations. Even in=
 the face of charges that public funding is &ldquo;welfare for politicians=
=2C&rdquo; voters in the midterms said that they would rally to a candidat=
e who argues that &ldquo;we need a government of=2C by and for the people&=
mdash;not government bought and paid for by wealthy donors.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Democrats lost badly in the Senate battleground states=2C located primaril=
y in the South and most rural areas of the country. Yet one of the most ef=
fective campaign attacks we tested linked big donations to politicians adv=
ancing the interests of wealthy donors who used unlimited=2C secret money=
 to make sure that billionaires&rsquo; and CEOs&rsquo; taxes remained arti=
ficially low and their loopholes stayed protected.<br>
<br>
The power of this attack comes from the central role of the corrupt Washin=
gton and Wall Street nexus in the new economy. While working-class men str=
uggled=2C the Republican candidate was helping government work for big cor=
porations and special interests.<br>
<br>
When Democracy Corps tested this attack in Louisiana=2C North Carolina=2C=
 Georgia=2C Iowa=2C Colorado=2C and the other Senate battleground states=
=2C it was among the most powerful attacks on the Republican candidates.<b=
r>
<br>
Of course=2C none of the Democratic candidates ran that ad.<br>
<br>
We asked presidential-year voters to react to a battery of bold initiative=
s that could form a Democratic economic agenda for 2016. They include poli=
cies to protect Medicare and Social Security=2C investments in infrastruct=
ure to modernize the country=2C a cluster of policies to help working fami=
lies with child care and paid leave=2C and new efforts to ensure equal pay=
 and family leave for women. Voters embraced these initiatives=2C and they=
 tested more strongly than a Republican alternative.<br>
<br>
Yet most important for our purposes are the results for white unmarried wo=
men and working-class women. These groups both put a &ldquo;streamline gov=
ernment&rdquo; initiative ahead of everything except protecting Social Sec=
urity and Medicare. They want to &ldquo;streamline government and reduce w=
aste and bureaucracy to make sure every dollar spent is a dollar spent ser=
ving people=2C not serving government.&rdquo; They gave even greater impor=
tance than white working-class men to streamlining government. For these w=
omen=2C being on the edge means feeling more strongly that government shou=
ld pinch pennies and start working for them.<br>
<br>
At the outset of the 2016 presidential election cycle=2C I tested a middle=
-class economic narrative that ended with a call for an economy that works=
 for working people and the middle class again. The narrative begins with=
 the recognition that people are drowning=2C jobs don&rsquo;t pay enough=
=2C and people are struggling to pay the bills despite all their hard work=
=2E At the heart of the narrative is an intention to use government to help=
=2C including assistance with making college and child care affordable and=
 ensuring equal pay for working women. It also includes tax credits for lo=
w-wage workers and the middle class and a promise to protect Medicare and=
 Social Security.<br>
<br>
When we tested this narrative among likely 2016 voters in January 2015 in=
 a poll conducted for Democracy Corps and the Women&rsquo;s Voices Women V=
ote Action Fund=2C over 70 percent of presidential-year voters said that t=
hey found it convincing=2C and almost 40 percent responded with intense su=
pport. More important in the context of the national elections=2C that nar=
rative tested about 20 points more convincing to voters than an alternativ=
e conservative economic narrative that faulted Democrats for leaving so ma=
ny people struggling and offered instead a small government route to growt=
h; it similarly outperformed a conservative Tea Party narrative that pushe=
d back against government overreach.<br>
<br>
This narrative speaks to all members of the Rising American Electorate. Fu=
lly 78 percent of the growing coalition of young people=2C unmarried women=
=2C and minorities said the narrative was convincing&mdash;dramatically hi=
gher than the vote share they gave to Democrats even in the best years. Un=
married women=2C in particular=2C were moved. A stunning eight in ten foun=
d it convincing=2C and nearly half chose &ldquo;very convincing.&rdquo; Th=
e narrative got its strongest generational support from the Millennials=2C=
 but it was nearly matched by the enthusiasm of the Baby Boomers.<br>
<br>
The middle-class economic narrative got the attention of white working-cla=
ss voters=2C too. They have not been great fans of government activism in=
 recent decades=2C to put it mildly=2C and they have only been giving Demo=
crats about a third of their votes. Yet an impressive 71 percent of white=
 non-college-educated women embrace this narrative when it is presented to=
 them; 41 percent do so strongly. In a head-to-head comparison=2C white wo=
rking-class women find the Democrats&rsquo; middle-class economic narrativ=
e slightly more convincing than the Republicans&rsquo; conservative=2C sma=
ll government economic narrative. While white working-class men responded=
 less intensely to this middle-class economic narrative=2C 62 percent stil=
l found it convincing&mdash;and that is only 5 points below their support=
 for the competing conservative small government narrative.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Independents also gave a slight edge (60 to 55 percent) to the Democrats&r=
squo; middle-class economic narrative that places government activism on b=
ehalf of the working and middle class at its core.<br>
<br>
What really strengthens and empowers the progressive economic narrative=2C=
 however=2C is a commitment to reform politics and government. That may se=
em ironic or contradictory=2C since the narrative calls for a period of go=
vernment activism. But=2C of course=2C it does make sense: Why would you e=
xpect government to act on behalf of the ordinary citizen when it is clear=
ly dominated by special interests? Why would you expect people who are fin=
ancially on the edge=2C earning flat or falling wages and paying a fair am=
ount of taxes and fees=2C not to be upset about tax money being wasted or=
 channeled to individuals and corporations vastly more wealthy and powerfu=
l than themselves?<br>
<br>
We have arrived at a tipping point at the outset of the 2016 election cycl=
e=2C where the demand to reform government is equal to or stronger than th=
e demand to reform the economy. More accurately=2C reform can make it poss=
ible to use governmental policies to help the middle class. In short=2C it=
 is reform first.<br>
<br>
In a straight test=2C the presidential electorate is as enthusiastic about=
 a reform narrative as the middle-class economic one. The first part of th=
e narrative focuses on big business and special interests that give big mo=
ney to politicians and then use lobbyists to win special tax breaks and sp=
ecial laws that cost the country billions. The second part emphasizes how=
 special interests and the bureaucracy protect out-of-date programs that d=
on&rsquo;t work. The bottom line of the narrative is that government refor=
m would free up money so the government could work for middle-class and wo=
rking families rather than big donors.<br>
<br>
Most importantly=2C when voters hear the reform narrative first=2C they ar=
e then dramatically more open to the middle-class economic narrative that=
 calls for government activism in response to America&rsquo;s problems.<br=
>
<br>
Among voters who heard the reform message first=2C 43 percent describe the=
 middle-class economic narrative as very convincing&mdash;11 points higher=
 than when they hear the economic message first. Among white working-class=
 voters in particular=2C this effect produced a 13-point jump in intensity=
 for the Democrats&rsquo; middle-class economic message (from 27 to 40 per=
cent).<br>
<br>
Clearly=2C these white working-class and downscale voters are open to a bo=
ld Democratic agenda and prefer it to a conservative Republican vision for=
 the country. To win their support=2C however=2C voters are demanding=2C w=
ith growing ferocity=2C that Democrats battle against America&rsquo;s corr=
upted politics and for a government that really works for the average citi=
zen. This is the route to a stronger result with white working-class and u=
nmarried women voters and more sustainable victories for Democrats=2C in 2=
016 and beyond.<br>
