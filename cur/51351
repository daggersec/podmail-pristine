Dear Friend,

Next Monday, January 28th at noon, concerned citizens, faith
congregations, and progressives like you and me will come together at
the Colorado Capitol for a rally to prevent gun violence. Monday's
rally will feature friends and family of victims, faith leaders,
elected officials, and others to call for the immediate passage of
sensible policies to prevent the gun violence that claims dozens of
American lives every day. Please read the information from our friends
at Together Colorado below, and we hope you can join us next Monday.

Thank you,

Alan Franklin
