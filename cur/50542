--Howard Kurtz weighs in on the importance of the media attention garnered
by Bernie Sanders. Shows clips of various commentators previously talking
about how much attention Bernie is getting. Shows clip of HRC saying that
she and Bernie each run their own campaigns and she always said it was
always going to be competitive. Shows clip of Senator McCaskill saying the
media is giving Bernie a free pass. Kurtz says there has been little focus
on his left wing agenda and there was little coverage of the finding that
Bernie wrote controversial pieces about sex. Says that Bernie may now have
to compete with recently announced Jim Webb. Says journalists would love to
see HRC in a competitive race but they won=E2=80=99t really be taking Berni=
e
seriously until they give him the same level of scrutiny as other
candidates. Special Report with Bret Baier

Starts with Obama calling for stricter gun control after church
shootings. Panelist
mentions that HRC has said she=E2=80=99s going to make gun control an issue=
 but of
this is because she has a primary right now and Bernie Sanders is more on
the conservative side and has voted against gun control measures. Says gun
control usually turns up poison in the general election. Says HRC is
starting to float gun control and is bringing up some of the tragedies that
have been happening. Special Report with Bret Baier

economic policies. Al Sharpton says the NY Times says HRC=E2=80=99s economi=

will include pre-k for all 4 year olds, expanded access to child care, paid
sick days and paid family leave, helping to make college students as
debt-free as possible, a higher minimum wage, and company profit-sharing
for employees. Says this is the contrast to the right. Angela Rye says that
Republicans have demonstrated that these are not policies they are going to
support. Cites Jeb Bush talking about Americans needing to work more hours,
does not mention pay disparity. Ryan Grim says parties will be trying to
energize their people, Republicans are going to have plenty of money and
will zero in on states where HRC doesn=E2=80=99t poll well. Says if someone=
 like
Bush can pick up the Latino vote, then they might be able to take a 51-49
election. Won=E2=80=99t see a whole lot of contrasting on economic issues.
Republicans will be pushing de-regulation and tax cuts to get the
government out of the way and let the country grow. PoliticsNation with Al

but he has a much bigger primary fight on his hands and HRC is still the
clear front runner on the Democratic side. Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer

hen she
was on the senate campaign trail. Shows clip of G.W. Bush saying that HRC

--Story on the private life of Bernie Sanders. Compares to what the public

school, marriage to her law school classmate, partnership at a law firm,
her husband in the Arkansas governor's mansion. Says if HRC=E2=80=99s life =

that in contrast, very little is known about Bernie Sander=E2=80=99s life. =

Washington Post joins to talk about what will be in the speech. Says it
will be a lot of spending on things such as Alzheimer=E2=80=99s research an=
d
universal pre-k. Says it will be a long speech with lots of ideas nodding
to Bernie Sanders and what he=E2=80=99s tapped into. Alex Witt says that in=
 1996
Bill Clinton declared the age of big government to be over, but Hohmann
says that the Democratic party has really changed and if HRC wants to
activate the Democratic base, she has to make a nod to the left who wants a
more muscular federal government. Says HRC has already been more liberal,
and now she is trying to catch up to where the party and Bernie is, but
that this is genuinely where HRC herself is. Says that Hillary surrogates
have been trying hard to lower expectations about her, but that he thinks
it=E2=80=99s very likely that if HRC was not the nominee, Bernie Sanders wo=
uld be.  He
thinks it=E2=80=99s a summer thing that is happening. HRC people are not sw=
eating
it, but they need the energy from his supporters. Weekends with Alex Witt

is influencing HRC=E2=80=99s campaign. Says that HRC is moving left of Bern=
ie on
gun control. Panel discusses saying that a lot of people wanted to see an
alternative to HRC. Says that you will not see the same kind of attacking
in the Democratic primary that you will on the Republican side. Says Bernie
is tapping the left side of the base and he is an ideas guy and he will
look less appealing once he lets out his radical ideas. Even if he does
well in Iowa and New Hampshire, he doesn=E2=80=99t have the ability to carr=
y it
through and win the nomination, but it makes it more interesting for people
to cover. Panelist David Payne says it=E2=80=99s intentional that HRC has g=
one left
of Bernie on gun control, who can occasionally be for 2nd amendment rights.
It=E2=80=99s a smart move on HRC=E2=80=99s campaign=E2=80=99s part to go le=

--Chris Stirewalt joins the show and discusses HRC with Lou Dobbs. Dobbs
says she=E2=80=99s not trusted according to any poll. Stirewalt says that t=
here are
always going to be 20% of people who love HRC, but the majority of people
don=E2=80=99t trust her and that number of people has grown over time. Says=
 the
question is whether HRC will double cross the people who vote for her in
favor of her own interests and those of her rich friends. Dobbs says Bernie
Sanders is drawing huge crowds and proving to be a reliable socialist.
Stirewalt
says Democratic socialism is really what a core group of the Democratic
base wants and the question is if HRC has to move left on those economic
issues, which could render her moot in the general election. Dobbs says Jeb
Bush and HRC don=E2=80=99t like each other. Stirewalt says Donald Trump is =
hesitant
to run as an independent because it would hurt his chances of beating HRC. =

important to get HRC to come out against the Iran deal. If she shows that
she is against the deal, Republicans would be quick to say if any deal
comes forward that HRC is responsible and a co-conspirator with Obama in
terms of making this deal happen. HRC would be arming the most dangerous
country. Pace claims that it is important to look at HRC because she will
soon be the Democratic voice of the party. Pace states that HRC cannot
remove or put a real distance between her involvements in the Iran deal,
but she can come out and say that the final deal has too many holes in it.
HRC could say that it leaves Iran with too many options. Fox=E2=80=99s Fox =
