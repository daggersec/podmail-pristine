Dear John, 

They call it a formula for economic growth. They call it a path to prosperity. I call it an injustice. 

I'm appalled that the House passed Paul Ryan's radical Republican budget, and I'm teaming up with Senator Bob Menendez to do whatever it takes to stop it from going any further. 

Click here right now to join us.  http://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/11916/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=429  

This senseless budget would cut food stamps for the poor, threaten health care for seniors, and squander employment and educational opportunities for the middle class. But Republicans in Congress continue to fight for tax breaks for the most wealthy and companies that ship our jobs overseas. 

In just 4 days, Congress will be back in session. Will you join Senator Menendez and me right now and tell lawmakers that the Ryan plan must not stand? We need your help to ensure this disgraceful budget never sees the light of day. 

Click here to sign our petition demanding that the Ryan budget be stopped. Make your voice heard today. http://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/11916/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=429 

Rep. Ryan says his budget will lower the skyrocketing deficit, but its massive tax cuts for the rich will only make things worse. And while the biggest earners reap the benefits, almost two-thirds of this budget's cuts are made to programs for low-income families. These are people who rely on Medicaid for their health care and food stamps to feed their children. 

We don't have a lot of time. Lawmakers return on Monday, which means we need to send a strong message right now that this budget is wrong for America and completely antithetical to all that we stand for. 

Sign our petition today and take a stand against this extreme budget. http://www.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/11916/petition.jsp?petition_KEY=429 

Sincerely, 

Kirsten Gillibrand
