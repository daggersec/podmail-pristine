Hey John, how are you? Hope you're getting at least a little rest this
holiday season as things only get crazier from here, I'm sure.

Sorry to bother you just before the holiday but I'm writing a piece for the
weekend on the eighth year of a presidency and how despite the obvious
lame-duck issues and the legislative window narrowing considerably, it can
still turn out to be an eventful year.

Any chance that's something you'd get on the phone with me for just a
couple minutes to talk about? Would love to have your voice and experience
in the story wearing your Clinton White House hat rather than your campaign
hat. Promise no questions about Trump.

Thanks so much.

Best,
Peter
