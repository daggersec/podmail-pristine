Tara already has our team on this. We're getting the betas made in
either event. We're prepping materials in either event.

I want to convene at 8:30 Wednesday morning to check in on this
question of releasing the ad. If there are some folks who can't make
that time we will follow up with individual phone calls with them
because our team needs to start hitting early morning.

Here is the call info.

For quick access, go to https://www.spiderphone.com/77786280
(This link will help connect both your browser and telephone to the call)

OR dial 1 (888) 550-5602 or +1 212-812-2800 and enter 7778 6280
