Highlight #1
*O'Reilly Questions McCain about Torture, Iraq, Striking Iran, and Obama's
Efforts to Paint His Candidacy as a Third Bush Term* (FNC 05/09/08 8:00pm)
BILL O'REILLY: You're opposed to water-boarding and I disagree with you on
that. I think the president of the United States, just the president, should
have the legal authority to order water-boarding in extraordinary
circumstances. Now according to tenet and to president bush, it was used
three times [=85] All three times the men broke, when they were water-boarde=
d
and they gave out information, according to the Bush administration that
saved thousands of lives.

JOHN MCCAIN: Well first of all the scenario you're talking about is a
million to one. Second of all, we know, that when you torture anybody, we
know that they'll give you things=85

O'REILLY: But these people gave out very good information.

MCCAIN:  They gave up very bad information too according to some sources.
But the point is, do want to abrogate the Geneva Conventions? In the next
war that we're in if you want American tortured, serviceman and woman, by
some foreign country when we are another war because we did it to the people
in our captivity?

O'REILLY: These are terrorists they're not soldiers though they're not
entitled to the Geneva Convention.

MCCAIN: Look, the Geneva Conventions. Yes, they are.

O'REILLY: No they're not, they're not in uniform.

MCCAIN: In all due respect, I'll send you the information. The Geneva
applies to every person held in captivity.

O'REILLY: Even Criminals?

MCCAIN: Even criminals, if they are in combat. Now, there is a difference
between a uniformed combatant and non-uniformed combatant.

O'REILLY: You think 9/11 they were combatants, those people?

MCCAIN: I think we are in a war against Radical Islamic Extremism and I
think that war is all over the globe.  And I believe, as Colin Powell does
and these military officers, who spent an entire career, that the Geneva
conventions call for a prohibition, a prohibition for inhumane, cruel, and
degrading treatment, and their concern is what happens to Americans in
future wars if they are held captive [=85]

O'REILLY: Dick Morris wants me to ask you this [=85] He thinks Netanyahu is
gonna be the next prime minister of Israel. And he thinks when that happens,
Netanyahu is gonna do preemptive strike on Iran, boom, knock them out
because of the nukes. Would you support that strike?

MCCAIN: I would have to know the circumstances; I would have to know that
nature of the threat, etc.

O'REILLY: I told Morris exactly you we're gonna say that.

MCCAIN: Any president would have to have information, but let me also say I
will never allow a second holocaust.

O'REILLY: If you believe as president of United States Iran has the nuke or
close, you gonna knock them out?

MCCAIN: You can't get into these hypotheticals, you really can't. But I will
not allow a second holocaust.

O'REILLY: Alright you're gonna have a tough sell on Iraq. Because 60%, 65%
of Americans are against it. And they' re tired, blood and treasure, and the
GAO, and even the Iraqi government, says that the corruption over there
within the Iraq government itself is off the chart. So how much more does
America have to absorb for a government that is inefficient and corrupt?

MCCAIN: This government is functioning badly, but better, ok? The Sunnis
have just agreed to come back into the government after leaving it. The
Maliki government now has control of Basra. If you had told me six months
ago that they had control of Basra, I would of been a little surprised. They
are gaining ground in Mosul, where a big battle is going on. Look, that
government is going to have elections sometime late this fall. That
government is now, has told Sadr that, basically, if you are going to keep
fighting the government, then we're not going to allow you in the next
elections. The problem in Iraq in today is not so much the government as it
is the rule of law. The progress is there. The progress is there on the
ground, and it has been long and hard and frustrating and a great sacrifice,
and it was mishandled terribly for nearly four years, as we know, but they
are succeeding.
And just let me tell you the consequences of setting a date for withdrawal,
and that is that you would have chaos, you would have genocide, America
would have to come back, and there would be greater sacrifice of American
blood and treasure. Nobody hates war more than those of us who have been in
them, but I also know the consequences when you don't exercise a fundamental
principle that Ronald Reagan articulated with three words, peace through
strength. I said a year ago, my friend, when you and I were off camera. We
were talking, I would much rather lose a campaign than lose a war, because
there is much more at stake, and that's are our precious young Americans who
are the bravest and who are the best, but have to be cared for better [=85]

O'REILLY: One of the questions that Hillary Clinton had difficulty last week
with me was with Afghanistan and Pakistan. I asked her, and I'm gonna ask
you, do you know where command and control for the Taliban right now.

MCCAIN: Oh yes, a place called Wezieristan.

O'REILLY: Ok, but it's in a little place further south in Quetta. Quetta is
not up in the northwest provinces.

MCCAIN: Could I just say that there are areas in Wezieristan that you know
the Pakistani government, Musharraf, made quote bargained with.

O'REILLY: In Quetta you could get them and the Pakistani government won't.
How' are you gonna make them?

MCCAIN: I think that our relations with Pakistan are in a very dicey
situation today with the new government. I know that our relations with
Pakistan are vital.

O'REILLY: As long as the Taliban can hide and have those safe harbors,
Afghanistan will never be stable.

MCCAIN: And I agree with you about Quetta but I'll also tell you that the
Wezierstan is hard to govern.

O'REILLY: The Pakistani government has got to help us, and that's the key to
that.

MCCAIN: They have to help us.

O'REILLY: [=85] The Obama campaign let loose its theme, I don't know whether
you picked it up, that voting for John McCain is voting for a president bush
third term. that there's no difference between you and President Bush. That
puts you in a bit of a difficult position. You don't want to insult the
president of United States, do you?

MCCAIN: No.

O'REILLY: He is unpopular. He's at 20% approval. How are you going to handle
that?

MCCAIN: Well two ways. One, my record, obviously on climate change, on
spending, on the War in I raq, etc., but also, I really believe that this
election will be decided on vision and change.

*John and Roberta McCain Interview with Katie Couric* (CBS 05/09/08 6:48pm)
KATIE COURIC: Let me start with you, if I could. You eloped, I understand =
=85
in Tijuana because your family didn't fully support your marriage to Sen.
McCain's father.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: That's right. You know, I see now what they're =85 it took a
long time for me to figure it out, but I was so young. And, of course, I was
still in school. And, of course, they objected. And my=85 the only thing abo=
ut
them maybe. And I think she had, you know what, a sailor has a girl in every
port. I think she heard that.

COURIC: Hopefully that wasn't true.

JOHN MCCAIN: You were at the University of Southern California at the time.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yeah, I was =85

JOHN MCCAIN: Living in a sorority house, is that right?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. Over the weekend, before my final exams in January, I
took my text books to study that weekend, if you can believe that?

COURIC: When you were eloping?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. Carried them with me 'cause I never looked at one of
them. And went back Monday morning and took those exams. So that whole week
=85

COURIC: How'd you do?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh, I passed.

JOHN MCCAIN: Would you mention =85 the establishment =85 in Tijuana =85 wher=
e the
marriage took place?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh. I'm gonna kill him. It was Caesar's bar in Tijuana.

COURIC: Classy.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yeah. In fact, it's still going. And that's where they
invented Caesar salad.

COURIC: Wow.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: The bartender was a man named Caesar.

COURIC: So you were a bit of a maverick. Is that where your son gets his
streak?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I don't know. I was just young and stupid.

JOHN MCCAIN: Now, now.

COURIC: But it all worked out.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh yes. Oh I never questioned one moment of that. It was the
right thing. I knew that I =85 was terribly in love. And I knew that it woul=
d
be for life, and it was.

COURIC: Your dad, Sen. McCain, was a distinguished naval officer, your
husband Mrs. McCain. And he was away a lot. Did that make the two of you
grow very close as you were growing up?

JOHN MCCAIN: It really did. Particularly during World War II when he was
gone almost all the time. Like =85 so many who served in the military in Wor=
ld
War II. They just went until the war was over. But he came back, I think,
two times or three times=85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I think three. I don't remember.

JOHN MCCAIN: To get new submarines, [the] submarine commander would get new
submarines to replace his older one. And that is the only time we saw him.
And we drove across [the country] as a family. And she would stop at every
historic place, and at (unintelligible) taverns, at the hermitage, at
whatever place of historic interest or value.

You know, it was tough in those days driving across the country with a
family by yourself. She did it with steadfastness. And =85 made it very
interesting. And so =85 I think, particularly growing up in the earliest yea=
rs
=85 we became very close. As my Dad is (unintelligible), but =85 she kept hi=
m
alive. She talked about him all the time.

COURIC: He would be gone for months at a time.?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I'd say three or four. He was in submarines. And =85when it
needed maintenance that's actually, this is what's so wonderful about our
country. When I see how many years it takes to build something or fix a
bridge, they put out a new submarine every single solitary month in World
War II. So you would take three or four at sea. And then that also wad be
assigned a new submarine. That's why he would come back.

COURIC: So he'd be gone for three or four months and the come back?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. Because =85 they would take a new submarine. And a
younger officer would take over the one that you left.

COURIC: That must have been hard for you too as =85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Really, I must have been oblivious. And I just always have
been a very happy person. I just take things as they come. And, maybe just
through stupidity. I didn't go through all the rigors that people seem to
think =85 I don't know.

JOHN MCCAIN: But I think, also, isn't it true, Mother, that all of America
was kind of in it together?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. No question.

JOHN MCCAIN: =85had left. And it was the war. And so it wasn't, you know =85
today it's kind of unique. And the Vietnam War was kind of unique in that a
small number bore the greater part of the burden. And I think one other
thing =85 and my mother can talk about it more than I can, is that her
identical twin sister lived in, and still does, live in Los Angeles. And we
went and stayed with her for =85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh yes. I had no place to go. She had three children and I
had three children under 10 years old and no help.

COURIC: But you all lived together or stayed together =85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. Well, not for terribly long. What do you say? Three,
four months? Six? I don't know.

COURIC: That was nice to have her, though.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh sure. We had a marvelous time. Can I tell you one thing?

COURIC: Yeah.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: We were really stuck with these children. You know =85 there=
's
nothing. So =85 we were invited to a lunch and my father heard us talking =
=85and
he said, "Well, I'll take care of the children." So that was wonderful.

And, of course, we stayed away too long. And when we drove up my father was
out on the front lawn with six children. And he had the keys in his hand.
And he said, "Well, I used to read those English novels about nannies and
nurseries." He said, "Now I know why England is surviving."

And he never offered to take care of those children again (laughter).

COURIC: I'm sure. Well, a lot of my friends who work for a living, you know,
they can't wait =85 to get back to work when they have to =85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: With those children. And he had six of them. All under 10.

COURIC: Wow. Let me ask you about what was Sen. McCain like as a teenager.
Because I know you referred to him as a scamp.

ROBERTA MCCAIN Well, he was just one of those kids, and always kind of in
and out of minor, me being mad at him, or something. He was just fun to be
with.

COURIC: But he got into a lot of trouble?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I don't think so. I don't seem to remember that much, well,
he certainly he =85 I don't think he ever got in, no, he never got in any re=
al
trouble. 'Cause he wouldn't have been able to stay in school.

COURIC: What did you mean by calling him a scamp?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: See, he was different to this thing. Johnny really was kind
of =85 he really was a leader. All of the boys around his age, they all =85 =
he
was just a leader. And they would gang around in our house. And, well, he
was, you know, he's naturally very funny, or was then.

I think he's curbed a lot of that humor. And I think some of it because they
=85 my thing is that they criticized Senator Dole =85 and he was funny. And
instead of that people saying he was not a (unintelligible) man. But he was
funny. And he was fun to be with. So, of course, when you're around with
somebody that's kind of halfway, you know, I don't know. He was just one of
those natural, young, American boys =85 in my definition.

COURIC: You had said that Sen. McCain's more like his father in that you
hold grudges, but he doesn't.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yeah, he won't hold a grudge unless =85

COURIC How can you not hold a grudge =85 and be in Washington as long as
you've been, Senator?

JOHN MCCAIN Well, I think Katie, that you find out over time, and it does
take time, and it's kind of a waste of time.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I'd know that.

JOHN MCCAIN: I had kind of a defining experience many years ago where a
fellow came to my office named David Ifshin (phonetic spelling), who had
been one of the leaders of the SDS =85

COURIC: Many of our viewers won't even recall that that was a very large
anti-Vietnam War movement.

JOHN MCCAIN: And we sat down we talked. And he said, "I think we ought to
put our differences behind us." And I did. And we worked together to try to
help human rights in Vietnam. To help the Buddhist end. And to restore
normal relations. Well, David, unfortunately, died at a very early age.

And I =85 feel so much better that David and I had a reconciliation and were
able to work together. Look, I have differences with some of my colleagues
in the senate. And I'm not close friends with some of them, to say the
least. But I think it's important to, when you have differences, to put them
aside and move on. And that was hard for me to learn. But I finally did. I
think I'm a better person for that.

COURIC: I know, during your son's captivity, Mrs. McCain, you had to believe
in your heart that he had died to get through every day.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: No =85 I only thought he had died the first two days.

COURIC: Oh really?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: The first =85

COURIC: How were you able to get through all those years when your son was
in captivity?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Well, I do have faith. I have faith in God's will and that's
all I ask for. I don't have particular things I ask for. And if I profess
that I have faith then I have to do it. And it's like these =85 all these
other things, people, they go =85 those things weren't very hard for me.

I just =85 if you can't do something about something, don't waste your time =
on
it. And I couldn't do anything about that. I could maintain my dignity and
the things that I'd always claimed that I believed in, God and my country.
And I believe in the Vietnam War. And one pretty good proof about the domino
theory is (unintelligible), Cambodia and Vietnam what today are communist.
And they weren't before the Vietnam War started.

JOHN MCCAIN: Is it true, though, and Katie might be interested, and that one
of the things is that with most people you didn't talk about me.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh no. I never said a word to anybody.

COURIC: Wasn't that hard?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Well, why bring it up?

COURIC: How worried were you, Senator, about your mom and dad and three
young children?

JOHN MCCAIN: I was most worried about my family and that they didn't know
what was happening to me. And I think that was harder, in some ways, on my
father because he was a commander of all the U.S. forces in the Pacific.
And, in 1972, he was told to bomb, order the bombing of B-52s in Hanoi. And
he knew that I lived in Hanoi.

That my prison camp, one of them, was there. And, of course, he carried out
=2E.. those instructions and gave the orders without hesitation. But it's
still pretty tough on a father, you know. I think, in some ways, the strain
on him was ... in some ways more difficult and of greater.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh yeah. Every single night he prayed on his knees. And I
have =85 a prayer book of his, an Episcopal prayer book where, you know, you=
r
hand finally will just be oil, and wear the paper out, those papers are just
worn out. They were just =85

JOHN MCCAIN: So it was tough on him. But he was a very brave person and
dedicated to the Navy. And I know it's maybe a little off the subject, but
it was a generation that he represented of the pre-World War II Naval
officer, military officer.

They all came from the same place. Either West Point or the Naval Academy.
And certainly they had their failings and flaws. But there was a certain
kind of-- apolitical attitude that most of that generation had of pre World
War II military officers. My mom may dispute with me, but I think Herman
Wolk's book-- Winds of War is one of-- and War and Remembrance is one of
those great stories where you kind of get that flavor. I recommend it very--
very highly. (Laughter) Don't you think?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. When he says that the military was apolitical, it was.
On an officer's (unintelligible) report they would put PI, which meant
political influence, and they scorned it. And that was a mark against you. I
don't ever remember politics being =85 discussed in my whole married life.

COURIC: It's really about honor, wasn't it?

JOHN MCCAIN: And it =85 wasn't all perfect. We weren't ready for World War I=
I,
as you know. That wasn't so much the military's fault, but also it was a
kind of insularity. And it was good for the military, in my view, to take
and have the officer corps from, frankly, all walks of society.

=46rom colleges and given more enlisted people. There were still some. But
more enlisted people to become officers. So I think, overall, it was an
improvement. But there was kind of some unique qualities about the pre World
War II military officer that was very interesting and admirable.

COURIC: Let's talk about politics and this campaign. As you both know, Sen.
McCain's age has been brought up quite a bit, because he will be the oldest
president ever elected to a first term if he wins in November. Has your mom
given you some good tips on staying fit?

John McCain: She certainly is an example I site quite frequently (laughter)
when the subject comes up. Obviously, as you can tell, she's in excellent
health. And I claim that I inherited all those genes from her.

COURIC: You don't like when your son's age is brought up, do you?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: No. No, I don't mind. You know =85 in politics there are
pluses and there are minuses. And it's true. One year's old could have a
minus. But when you think about the experience, and what he's accomplished,
and the legislation that he's been able to get through, as opposed to a man
who, two years ago was in the state legislature at-- Illinois. So that is a
big minus in my view of =85

JOHN MCCAIN: That's why I have to take her with me wherever I go.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: With someone with so little experience. And then who has the
most liberal of record of voting in the United States. And I'm no liberal.
So of course I think that it's over (unintelligible) on the Republican side.

COURIC: You speak your mind don't you? (Laughter) I know that, back in
January, you said the Republican base was offering no help whatsoever =85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: That's true.

COURIC: =85to your son. (Laughter) Now that he's become the nominee do you
think he's getting the help he needs?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I don't know. I really don't know. And I'm not equivocating.
I don't know anything about it.

COURIC: Do you feel, though, that the Republican Party is behind him enough?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I think they are a lot wiser than I am. And they know =85 ho=
w
to do this. I don't. So I really =85 and I'm not really trying to get out of
this. I =85 haven't thought about it. And I would assume that they know what
they're doing, and they're doing the way that this should be run
politically.

COURIC: Do you ever say, "Mom, please zip it!?"

ROBERT MCCAIN: It won't do him any good.

JOHN MCCAIN: (Laughter) I was gonna say, I think at 96 she probably has
earned the right to express her views. And I think, Mom, if I could just add
on, I think our party =85 is united. I think we have a lot of work to do,
obviously. But primaries are always tough. And =85 we're pretty much togethe=
r.

ROBERT MCCAIN: Yeah. Well, I'm =85 I don't know. I assume that it's the way =
it
should be.

COURIC: Some of your opponents, Senator, have said that you are the
equivalent of a third Bush term. How can you convince voters that you're not
gonna be more of the same?

JOHN MCCAIN: Well, obviously, a view of my record, which there has been
differences on climate change, or the war, or spending. But the important
thing I think about every election, and this one probably more so than many
recently is that how we're gonna have a plan of action and vision for the
future.

Americans are going through a very tough time now. Housing issue. People are
sitting around the kitchen table who have just lost their jobs recently and
suddenly. So I think they're very interested in what you can do to help them
better themselves and their lives and their futures. And I think that's what
most voters would focus on. And I have to give them that vision. And I have
the vision and the plan of action. But I've got about six months now, I
think, in order to convince them. And it's gonna be a tough job.

COURIC: I know you've talked about this, Sen. McCain, but =85 I want to give
you just a moment to clarify it. Often the criticism against you, vis-=E0-vi=
s
Iraq, is that you're going to commit U.S. troops for an additional 100
years. What exactly did you say and why do you think that's been so
misinterpreted?

JOHN MCCAIN: What I was saying and what I say today is that after we win the
war in Iraq, when they have an esca=85 a security arrangement with the Iraqi=
s
after the Korean War we kept troops in South Korea. It was a buffer for our
security.

After the war in first Gulf War we have a base in Kuwait. It's not American
presence. It is American causalities that Americans care about. And I'm
gonna win this war. And I'm gonna bring our troops home and I'm gonna bring
them home honorably.

And if we do what Sen. Obama and Sen. Clinton want to do, I am convinced
that we will be back with greater sacrifice of American blood and treasure.
And a year ago, Katie, I said to you I would much rather lose a political
campaign than lose a war. We are succeeding in Iraq. And I'm not going to
take a course of action that I believe will endanger American lives and
cause us to have more sacrifice. And I'm convinced to that.

COURIC: What do you say =85 a troop presence? How many troops are we talking
about senator?

JOHN MCCAIN: It would depend on the security arrangement. But, again, it's =
=85
the same kind of deal we have with South Korea. We have with Kuwait. We have
with Japan. We have with Germany. We have troops, as the world's super
power, in a lot of places in the world.

After the war is over, and it will be over, and we will bring the troops
home with =85 honor and victory, then we will discuss those arrangements wit=
h
the Iraqis, just as we did after the Korean War with the South Korean
government. And I don't know of anyone who objects to having American troops
in South Korea.

COURIC: Mrs. McCain, you were born before women had the right to vote.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yeah, that's right.

COURIC: And I'm just curious how you feel about the first serious female
candidate for president of the United States, just the very notion of that
how...

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I think it's a wonderful idea. I don't see any difference
between a man and a woman. Except physically. They're stronger than we are
but the rest of that I think that =85 what's happened with women and is
already been =85 proved. You don't have to argue about it.

COURIC: Have you talked to Sen. Clinton, Sen. McCain, lately?

JOHN MCCAIN: Not recently, I haven't, Katie. I just haven't had the chance
to run into her.

COURIC: You think very highly of her.

JOHN MCCAIN: I respect her. I respect Sen. Obama. And we intend to run a
respectful campaign.

COURIC: You and Sen. Clinton =85 had a noted drinking contest in (Laughter)
Estonia. And I understand she =85 drank you under the table. Is that not
right? Can you confirm that senator?

JOHN MCCAIN: That is the most exaggerated story in history. We had a drink
together after a long day. And that was really all there was to it. Really,
that's all there was too it. I know it makes for exciting conversation but
it just that just simply wasn't the case. But we did travel together. And
we've worked together on the Armed Services Committee.

COURIC: Who would you rather run against? Sen. Clinton or Sen. Obama?

JOHN MCCAIN: It doesn't matter. I have no choice in the matter, so we just
have to run our own campaign. Each, according to some experts, have, you
know, but it's all gonna be about my campaign.

COURIC: Some people say =85 the longer this goes on the more damaging it is =
to
the Democratic Party. Are you encouraging Sen. Clinton to stay in the race?
(Laughter)

JOHN MCCAIN: No, but, you know, I've heard two sides of that argument too
Katie. One is that =85 the dissention between the two of them =85 helps me i=
n =85
that the differences that are exploited between them. The other argument I
hear is, well, they're out there motivating people to register as Democrats.

And motivating their base of =85 So I don't know what's the right answer. Bu=
t
I =85 think, also, that most Americans really start focusing political
campaigns after the conventions. Which is, you know, the end of august, the
beginning of September. And then I think they'll be focusing a lot =85 on ou=
r
campaigns and making judgments of that. Just as in the primaries, as you
might recall, people really didn't start focusing until after Labor Day this
last year.

COURIC: What is the most exciting part about the potential of having your
son in the White House?

ROBERT MCCAIN: I don't have any.

COURIC: Come on.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I'm true =85 it's true. What happens will happen.

JOHN MCCAIN: How about being able to go to =85 any of the museums any time d=
ay
or night? How's that?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: That's another matter.

COURIC: What do you think is the most exciting aspect of your son's
potential presidency?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I'm amazed =85 how well rounded he is on so many subjects.
When =85 just out of the blue people ask him questions =85 and he knows as m=
uch
as he knows. Honey, everything about the McCain family is just 100 percent
(unintelligible) right or wrong =85 that's it.

JOHN MCCAIN: But could I also, in the interest of full disclosure, mention
that, from time to time, we have spirited discussions.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh yes.

JOHN MCCAIN: Because we don't always agree.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: We do have. (Laughter)

COURIC: What is the biggest issue of disagreement?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: It's such =85 I'm not gonna worry about it.

COURIC You can't tell me?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: No.

JOHN MCCAIN: Sometimes it's =85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: I don't want to fight on television. (Laughter)

COURIC: What are these big issues?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh no, hey look, hey look. One thing about my mom, she
really does keep up. She watches the news. She reads the newspaper. She
carries them around with me. And so it's kind of issue of the day kind of
thing when we=85

ROBERTA MCCAIN: That's right.

JOHN MCCAIN: =85when we discuss. What do you think about this? And =85 we're
pretty well in tune. (Laughter)

COURIC: But once in a while=85

JOHN MCCAIN: Oh yeah =85 and I think its fun. Because I think it's wonderful=
 =85
that she is this well informed. And she mentioned that, at a very early age,
she got married to a naval officer. I challenge you there's hardly a museum
or a church in Europe that she doesn't know or hasn't visited. And I mean
it. She has really enriched her life by studying, reading and travel. And
I'm proud. And she still does it.

COURIC: At 96 you're still doing it?

ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh sure. I was up there last week in New York just to go to
the Metropolitan ...

COURIC: You're amazing.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: No =85 do you want me to sit around and play bridge every da=
y?
Or discuss my last knee replacement? (Laughter) Or pass around pictures of
my grandchildren? Well, that isn't my choice of a way to live. I love to.
That's one reason I live in Washington is art museums are open seven days a
week, and they're all free, and you can't say that about another city in the
world.

JOHN MCCAIN: That's nice. That's nice.

ROBERTA MCCAIN: It's true.

COURIC: Finally, Sen. McCain, if I could ask you a day-of-news story, you
know, Myanmar has been in the news should much. If you were president, what
would you do to convince the military government to allow international aid
into that country to help the thousands - perhaps millions - of people who
have been displaced by this?

JOHN MCCAIN: Did I mention one of the great honors of my life was, a long
time ago, I had the incredible honor of meeting (unintelligible) in Burma.
There's no greater living person in the world today, you know, who has
sacrificed so much for her country.

I think (unintelligible) and China have great influence over Burma. I would
start putting some pressures on their appealing to them to have this
(unintelligible) at least allowing aid to care for these people. It's really
awful. It's an awful government when they have to find out that one of these
catastrophes is happening by outside radio and not even warn their own
people. They find out by outside communications. This is a very bad
government. And right now I think that we should ask the other countries in
the region, as well as China, that they have close ties to, to really put
some pressure on them for humanitarian purposes.

COURIC: Do you think enough is being done about it?

JOHN MCCAIN: I don't know. The Chinese have an imagine problem right now, as
we know, over Tibet. I think we could tell them that it would help their
reputation if they weighed in heavily to =85 get the=85 I use the word
government loosely=85 to help =85 let assistance come in this humanitarian
effort.

COURIC: It's Mother's Day. What are you going to do for your ma for Mother's
Day, Senator?

JOHN MCCAIN: Tell her how beautiful she is.

*On CNN Lieberman touts McDifferent from Bush on Climate Change, Defends
McCain on Myanmar-Lobbyist Controversy, and is Surprised to Hear Iraqis Want
a Democratic President *(CNN 05/09/08
KIRAN CHENTRY:Alright, let's talk about this major speech that he's gonna be
making on climate change today [...]Ok, the environment reality check here.
I just want to throw two polls at you quickly. LA Times/Bloomberg Poll
saying 4% of the people say the environment is a top concern, very small
percentage. Then just today, another poll comes out today, a Gallup Poll,
finds that 38% of likely voters saying McCain's association with Bush makes
them less likely to vote for McCain. Why is he talking about the
environment, is this more about disassociating himself with the Bush
administration?

JOE LIEBERMAN: Well I think he's taking about the environment, particularly
climate change, because he cares about it and if you ask John McCain what
are some of the things he most wants to accomplish as president, one is to
get America back into global leadership and to do something about global
warming [...]John McCain's willingness to step out early, five or six years
ago, when he and I introduced the first really significant anti-global
warming bill in the Senate, I think is not only one of the reasons why I
crossed party lines to support him but one of the reasons why I think a lot
of Democrats and independents are gonna do the same. And it's certainly puts
the lie to this argument that John McCain is just George Bush over again.
President Bush with all respect, has pulled out, pulled America out of the
global war against Global Warming, John McCain will put us back into the
leadership of it and that's where we must be.
[...]
CHENTRY: Alright well let's step aside from the polls and talk subject
matter. Obviously the Iraq war, he continues to embrace that. This is high
on the agenda of the American people. I just returned from Baghdad and what
was interesting to me, I sat down with dozens of Iraqi soldiers and dozens
of students at Baghdad University, and Senator they said to me 'we don't
want to see a Republican president.' Matter of fact out of every single one
I talked to, only person said they supported John McCain. They said 'we're
living a Republican war, look at this, it's a disaster. We want to see a
Democrat for president.' What does John McCain say to the future of Iraq
when we're talking about Iraqi soldiers and Baghdad University students?
They're the ones living this.

LIEBERMAN: Well I'm real surprised to hear that.

CHENTRY: I was too. It was very interesting, they were very blunt and very
straight forward.

LIEBERMAN: Not that I expect the Iraqis to vote in our election. But I will
tell you in all the visits I've made there, and its eight, the Iraqi people
on the street, the Iraqi military, the Iraqi government that I've talked to
don't want us to just pick up and leave. Because, which is what Senator
Obama and Senator Clinton have been advocating. They want us obviously not
to stay there forever. Senator McCain wants the war to stop and have us pull
back into bases and be on a path, a reasonable path of withdrawal. I think
the Iraqi people more than anybody know they've made tremendous progress in
the last year and half toward security, toward economic rebirth, toward some
kind of political national reconciliation. And the last thing they want us
to do in '09 is just to pick up begin to retreat because they'll be the
victims, they'll be genocide, they'll be blood shed. Iran and Al Qaeda will
win and we'll lose. And so I'm surprised at what your unscientific poll
found and I honestly don't think it reflects the feelings of most Iraqis,
certainly the ones on the street that I've met when I've been there.

CHENTRY: Final question, it's in the news, Myanmar. McCain has been very
vocal about human rights abuses there. And I'm sure you're well aware of
over the weekend, Doug Goodyear, the PR exec that was hired to run the RNC
this summer resigned because his company had lobbied for the military junta.
How did that slip through the cracks? And do you think that John McCain
should even be employing lobbyists or former lobbyists in this campaign?

LIEBERMAN: I don't know how that slipped through the cracks. But I can tell
you, John McCain has been more clear and more vigorous than anybody else in
American politics in speaking out against the military dictatorship in
Burma/Myanmar [...]

*On Fox News, Lieberman Emphasizes McCain's Independent-Mindedness on Global
Warming* (FNC 05/12/08 8:20am)
STEVE DOOCY: Later today up in Portland , Oregon I believe John McCain is
gonna talk about global warming. What's he gonna say?

JOE LIEBERMAN: Well this is one of the reasons why I crossed party lines to
support John. Obviously, in addition to his tremendous ability to Commander
in Chief at a time of war. It's also the reason why I think a lot of
Democrats and independents are gonna cross party lines to support him. John
saw a problem. He spent some time studying it, he decided global warming. He
came to me about six years ago and said let's get together and do something
about this. And we put together the first significant anti-global warming
bill. A bill that uses market mechanisms to move us slowly down in terms of
our greenhouse gas emissions. And I think John today is gonna talk about
that and why he as president will make this a priority of his administration
[...]

KILMEADE: Senator Lieberman, he does deserve credit but a lot of
conservatives just passed out that this is just one of his initial
initiatives. Because a lot them don't believe it and they don't feel it
should be a priority.

LIEBERMAN: No, I know. And honestly I'd say that this is who he is. He's
independently minded. You know, he takes some positions I don't agree with.
We don't agree with on everything [...] John knows that a lot of
conservatives don't agree with him on global warming but he thinks it's
right [...]

*Brzezinski Grills Lieberman on Gas Tax Holiday, while Buchanan Questions if
he Wants to Attack Iran*(MSNBC 05/12/08 08:04am)
MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Hmmm, free pass for Senator McCain or is his time coming?

JOE LIEBERMAN: Well look, he was fortunate enough to secure the nomination
of his party early so he had time. I don't exactly think that he has had a
free pass. The democrats have been running a fare amount of negative attack
tv on John for some period of time, but thats campaigns. i think he has used
this time well

BRZEZINSKI: Senator let me talk to you about one of those ideas because I
won't be giving him a free pass...

BRZEZINSKI: How in the world is that gas tax holiday, that your senator is
behind how is that good policy at this point, I'm sorry, when it comes to
republicans and them trying to show themselves to be serious about energy
policy it just seems like that just flies in the face of it.

LIEBERMANN: Well I think that the importanant thing to say is that uh, the
gas tax holiday that John McCain is proposing for the summer is not his
energy policy that is a kind of help to lower and middle income families to
save a little money over the summer... he is going to reveal a very bold
climate change policy. He is against global warming and in dealing with
global warming policy as independently as he has the McCain program will be
the most significant energy independence program that America has every
adopted it will be the moon shot, the Apollo project that everybody has said
we need for energy because it will break our dependence of foreign oil.

PAT BUCHANAN: Do you believe that the United States should conduct air
strikes on the Iranaian forces in Iran if they do not stop this and do you
expect President Bush to do something like this?

LIEBERMAN: I hope we don't have to get to the point of moving in anyway into
Iran to strike at the base of the people who are responsible for killing
Americans, but I hope the Iranian government has in mind that that is a
distinct possibility... I want them to understand that if they don't stop
this, they run the risk of having us strike the uh lines they are using, the
bases the depots that they have, Pat, you can't just sit back.

double standard there?

PAT BUCHANAN: Pastor Hagee comes out of that evangelical community do you
have anything in your book about him?

MATT TAIBBI: Yeah, about hald the book is about me going under cover, I was
actually a member of that church for 5 or 6 months last year.

BUCHANAN: What did you find down at the church, how often did he speak of
things that you would say are outside the realm or much more in the
political realm?

TAIBBI: Every minute, the church is very heavily into the belief that the
world is coming to an end imminently... right armageddonnites, and that we
have to support the state of Isreal in order to stay on the right side of
the conflict at Armageddon. That is a belief that they didn't talk about
occasionally they talked about it constantly.

TAIBBI: In fact they believe the Isrealies have to convert to Christianity
at the end or else there will be "the mother of all holocaust" they call it.

*Fox News Highlights the Seven Steps for McCain to Beat Obama, Number Two is
Wooing the Media* (FNC 05/12/08 7:00am)
GRETCHEN CARLSON: John McCain, and apparently there are seven steps now,
that at least some newspaper columnists are suggesting that McCain will use
against Barack Obama to beat him in November. The first one, being kind of
an obvious one I guess, that he will paint Obama as a false messiah. In
other words, the unfulfilled prophet. And I think what he'll do is instead
of using his age as negative, he'll say my age means I'm experienced.

STEVE DOOCY: Well Steve Schmidt, who is one of McCain's advisers, says
regarding the lofty rhetoric that Barack Obama uses in every speech, it's
all non-sense. That's what Steve Schmidt says. Says, you know, he's talking
about change but what's he gonna change and he's gonna change it? [...] All
seven of these are detailed in the brand new Time magazine. Number two is
work and woo and win the referees. And what they're talking about his the
media. And in fact John McCain has just restarted the straight talk express
where he'll hop in the bus , have a couple three four different reporters in
the back, and they'll just chat for hundreds of miles.

BRIAN KILMEADE: And make it seem as thought that's an exclusive story for
that reporter. And of course usually they say 'wow I feel like an insider'
and write something more positive, it worked before. This is something
they're making a lot of progress on is number three. Get Barack Obama in a
Town Hall setting. This is a proposal put out there by the McCain camp [...]

CARLSON: Number four is claim the high road without leaving the low road.
But this one will be an interesting one for McCain because you know he's
gone on record as saying he would not make Barack Obama's Reverend Wright an
issue in the November election [...] When they're going up against each
other we've already heard some pretty nasty comments between the two, last
week it was Hamas.

DOOCY: [...]Number five is use the vice president to temper the age issue

Questions McCain about Torture, Iraq, Striking Iran, and Obama's Efforts to
Paint His Candidacy as a Third Bush Term</i></b> (FNC 05/09/08 8:00pm)</span=
><br><span>BILL O'REILLY: You're
opposed to water-boarding and I disagree with you on that. I think the
president of the United States, just the president, should have the legal
authority to order water-boarding in extraordinary circumstances. Now accord=
ing
to tenet and to president bush, it was used three times [=85] All three time=
s the
men broke, when they were water-boarded and they gave out information,
according to the Bush administration that saved thousands of lives.</span><b=
r><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: Well first
of all the scenario you're talking about is a million to one. Second of all,=
 we
know, that when you torture anybody, we know that they'll give you things=85=
</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: But these
people gave out very good information.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><spa=
n>MCCAIN:<span>&nbsp; </span>They gave up very bad information too
according to some sources. But the point is, do want to abrogate the Geneva
Conventions? In the next war that we're in if you want American tortured, se=
rviceman
and woman, by some foreign country when we are another war because we did it=
 to
the people in our captivity?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY=
: These are
terrorists they're not soldiers though they're not entitled to the Geneva
Convention.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN=
: Look, the Geneva
Conventions. Yes, they are.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY:=
 No they're
not, they're not in uniform.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: =
In all due
respect, I'll send you the information. The Geneva applies to every person h=
eld
in captivity.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: Even
Criminals?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: Even criminals,
if they are in combat. Now, there is a difference between a uniformed combat=
ant
and non-uniformed combatant.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY=
: You think 9/11
they were combatants, those people?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>M=
CCAIN: I think we are
in a war against Radical Islamic Extremism and I think that war is all over =
the
globe.<span>&nbsp; </span>And I believe, as Colin
Powell does and these military officers, who spent an entire career, that th=
e
Geneva conventions call for a prohibition, a prohibition for inhumane, cruel=
,
and degrading treatment, and their concern is what happens to Americans in
future wars if they are held captive [=85]</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br>=
<span>O'REILLY: Dick Morris
wants me to ask you this [=85] He thinks Netanyahu is gonna be the next prim=
e
minister of Israel. And he thinks when that happens, Netanyahu is gonna do
preemptive strike on Iran, boom, knock them out because of the nukes. Would =
you
support that strike?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: I would =
have to
know the circumstances; I would have to know that nature of the threat, etc.=
</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: I told Morris
exactly you we're gonna say that.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCC=
AIN: Any president
would have to have information, but let me also say I will never allow a sec=
ond
holocaust.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: If you believe
as president of United States Iran has the nuke or close, you gonna knock th=
em
out?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: You can't get
into these hypotheticals, you really can't. But I will not allow a second
holocaust.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: Alright you're
gonna have a tough sell on Iraq. Because 60%, 65% of Americans are against i=
t.
And they&#39; re tired, blood and treasure, and the GAO, and even the Iraqi
government, says that the corruption over there within the Iraq government
itself is off the chart. So how much more does America have to absorb for a
government that is inefficient and corrupt?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br=
><span>MCCAIN: This government
is functioning badly, but better, ok? The Sunnis have just agreed to come ba=
ck
into the government after leaving it. The Maliki government now has control =
of
Basra. If you had told me six months ago that they had control of Basra, I
would of been a little surprised. They are gaining ground in Mosul, where a =
big
battle is going on. Look, that government is going to have elections sometim=
e
late this fall. That government is now, has told Sadr that, basically, if yo=
u
are going to keep fighting the government, then we're not going to allow you=
 in
the next elections. The problem in Iraq in today is not so much the governme=
nt
as it is the rule of law. The progress is there. The progress is there on th=
e
ground, and it has been long and hard and frustrating and a great sacrifice,
and it was mishandled terribly for nearly four years, as we know, but they a=
re
succeeding.</span><br><span>And
just let me tell you the consequences of setting a date for withdrawal, and
that is that you would have chaos, you would have genocide, America would ha=
ve
to come back, and there would be greater sacrifice of American blood and
treasure. Nobody hates war more than those of us who have been in them, but =
I
also know the consequences when you don't exercise a fundamental principle t=
hat
Ronald Reagan articulated with three words, peace through strength. I said a
year ago, my friend, when you and I were off camera. We were talking, I woul=
d
much rather lose a campaign than lose a war, because there is much more at
stake, and that's are our precious young Americans who are the bravest and w=
ho
are the best, but have to be cared for better [=85]</span><br><span>&nbsp;</=
span><br><span>O'REILLY: One of the
questions that Hillary Clinton had difficulty last week with me was with
Afghanistan and Pakistan. I asked her, and I'm gonna ask you, do you know wh=
ere
command and control for the Taliban right now.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span>=
<br><span>MCCAIN: Oh yes, a place
called Wezieristan.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: Ok, but=
 it's
in a little place further south in Quetta. Quetta is not up in the northwest
provinces.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: Could I just say
that there are areas in Wezieristan that you know the Pakistani government,
Musharraf, made quote bargained with.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span=
>O'REILLY: In Quetta you
could get them and the Pakistani government won't. How&#39; are you gonna ma=
ke
them?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: I think that our
relations with Pakistan are in a very dicey situation today with the new gov=
ernment.
I know that our relations with Pakistan are vital.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</s=
pan><br><span>O'REILLY: As long as the
Taliban can hide and have those safe harbors, Afghanistan will never be stab=
le.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: And I agree with
you about Quetta but I'll also tell you that the Wezierstan is hard to gover=
n.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: The Pakistani
government has got to help us, and that's the key to that.</span><br><span>&=
nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: They have to
help us.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: [=85] The Obama
campaign let loose its theme, I don't know whether you picked it up, that
voting for John McCain is voting for a president bush third term. that there=
's
no difference between you and President Bush. That puts you in a bit of a
difficult position. You don't want to insult the president of United States,=
 do
you?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: No.</span><br><span>&nbs=
p;</span><br><span>O'REILLY: He is
unpopular. He's at 20% approval. How are you going to handle that?</span><br=
><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>MCCAIN: Well two ways.
One, my record, obviously on climate change, on spending, on the War in I ra=
q,
etc., but also, I really believe that this election will be decided on visio=
n
and change.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span><b><i><span style=3D"colo=

MCCAIN: That&#39;s right. You know, I see now what they&#39;re =85
it took a long time for me to figure it out, but I was so young. And, of
course, I was still in school. And, of course, they objected. And my=85 the =
only
thing about them maybe. And I think she had, you know what, a sailor has a g=

in every port. I think she heard that.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><spa=

?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: When you were eloping?</spa=
n><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. Carried them with me=
 &#39;cause I never looked at
one of them. And went back Monday morning and took those exams. So that whol=

where the marriage took place?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERT=

they invented Caesar salad.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: W=

 a man named Caesar.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: So you w=

gets his streak?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: I do=

<span>JOHN MCCAIN: Now, now.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: =
But it all worked out.</span><br>
<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh yes. Oh I never questioned o=
ne moment of that.
It was the right thing. I knew that I =85 was terribly in love. And I knew t=
hat
it would be for life, and it was.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COU=
RIC: Your dad, Sen. McCain, was a distinguished naval officer,
your husband Mrs. McCain. And he was away a lot. Did that make the two of yo=
u
grow very close as you were growing up?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><sp=
an>JOHN MCCAIN: It really did. Particularly during World War II when
he was gone almost all the time. Like =85 so many who served in the military=
 in
World War II. They just went until the war was over. But he came back, I thi=
nk,
two times or three times=85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA M=
CCAIN: I think three. I don&#39;t remember.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br=
><span>JOHN MCCAIN: To get new submarines, [the] submarine commander
would get new submarines to replace his older one. And that is the only time=
 we
saw him. And we drove across [the country] as a family. And she would stop a=
t
every historic place, and at (unintelligible) taverns, at the hermitage, at
whatever place of historic interest or value.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><=
br><span>You know, it was tough in those days driving across the country
with a family by yourself. She did it with steadfastness. And =85 made it ve=
ry
interesting. And so =85 I think, particularly growing up in the earliest yea=
rs =85
we became very close. As my Dad is (unintelligible), but =85 she kept him al=
ive.
She talked about him all the time.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>CO=
URIC: He would be gone for months at a time.?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><=
br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: I&#39;d say three or four. He was in submarines. An=
d
=85when it needed maintenance that&#39;s actually, this is what&#39;s so won=
derful about
our country. When I see how many years it takes to build something or fix a
bridge, they put out a new submarine every single solitary month in World Wa=
r
II. So you would take three or four at sea. And then that also wad be assign=
ed
a new submarine. That&#39;s why he would come back.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</=
span><br><span>COURIC: So he&#39;d be gone for three or four months and the =
come
back?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. Because =
=85 they would take a new submarine.
And a younger officer would take over the one that you left.</span><br><span=
>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: That must have been hard for you too as =85<=
/span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Really, I must have b=
een oblivious. And I just
always have been a very happy person. I just take things as they come. And,
maybe just through stupidity. I didn&#39;t go through all the rigors that pe=
ople
seem to think =85 I don&#39;t know.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>J=
OHN MCCAIN: But I think, also, isn&#39;t it true, Mother, that all of
America was kind of in it together?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>R=
OBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. No question.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN=
 MCCAIN: =85had left. And it was the war. And so it wasn&#39;t, you
know =85 today it&#39;s kind of unique. And the Vietnam War was kind of uniq=
ue in
that a small number bore the greater part of the burden. And I think one oth=
er
thing =85 and my mother can talk about it more than I can, is that her ident=
ical
twin sister lived in, and still does, live in Los Angeles. And we went and
stayed with her for =85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAI=
N: Oh yes. I had no place to go. She had three
children and I had three children under 10 years old and no help.</span><br>=
<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: But you all lived together or stayed to=
gether =85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. Well,=
 not for terribly long. What do you say?
Three, four months? Six? I don&#39;t know.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br>=
<span>COURIC: That was nice to have her, though.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</spa=
n><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh sure. We had a marvelous time. Can I tell you
one thing?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Yeah.</span><br><s=
pan>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: We were really stuck with these c=
hildren. You know
=85 there&#39;s nothing. So =85 we were invited to a lunch and my father hea=
rd us
talking =85and he said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll take care of the children.&quot=
; So that
was wonderful.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>And, of course, we sta=
yed away too long. And when we drove up my
father was out on the front lawn with six children. And he had the keys in h=
is
hand. And he said, &quot;Well, I used to read those English novels about
nannies and nurseries.&quot; He said, &quot;Now I know why England is
surviving.&quot;</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>And he never offered=
 to take care of those children again
(laughter).</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: I&#39;m sure. Wel=

you know, they can&#39;t wait =85 to get back to work when they have to =85<=
/span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: With those children. =
And he had six of them. All
under 10.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Wow. Let me ask you=
 about what was Sen. McCain like as a
teenager. Because I know you referred to him as a scamp.</span><br><span>&nb=
sp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN Well, he was just one of those kids, and =
always
kind of in and out of minor, me being mad at him, or something. He was just =
fun
to be with.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: But he got into a=
 lot of trouble?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: I do=
n&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t seem to remember that
much, well, he certainly he =85 I don&#39;t think he ever got in, no, he nev=
er got in
any real trouble. &#39;Cause he wouldn&#39;t have been able to stay in schoo=
l.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: What did you mean by calli=
ng him a scamp?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: See, =
he was different to this thing. Johnny really
was kind of =85 he really was a leader. All of the boys around his age, they=
 all
=85 he was just a leader. And they would gang around in our house. And, well=
, he
was, you know, he&#39;s naturally very funny, or was then.</span><br><span>&=
nbsp;</span><br><span>I think he&#39;s curbed a lot of that humor. And I thi=
nk some of it
because they =85 my thing is that they criticized Senator Dole =85 and he wa=
s
funny. And instead of that people saying he was not a (unintelligible) man. =
But
he was funny. And he was fun to be with. So, of course, when you&#39;re arou=
nd with
somebody that&#39;s kind of halfway, you know, I don&#39;t know. He was just=
 one of
those natural, young, American boys =85 in my definition.</span><br><span>&n=
bsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: You had said that Sen. McCain&#39;s more like h=
is father in
that you hold grudges, but he doesn&#39;t.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br>=
<span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yeah, he won&#39;t hold a grudge unless =85</span><br>=
<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC How can you not hold a grudge =85 and be=
 in Washington as
long as you&#39;ve been, Senator?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOH=
N MCCAIN Well, I think Katie, that you find out over time, and
it does take time, and it&#39;s kind of a waste of time.</span><br><span>&nb=
sp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: I&#39;d know that.</span><br><span>&nbsp=
;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: I had kind of a defining experience many year=
s ago
where a fellow came to my office named David Ifshin (phonetic spelling), who
had been one of the leaders of the SDS =85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br>=
<span>COURIC: Many of our viewers won&#39;t even recall that that was a very
large anti-Vietnam War movement.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN=
 MCCAIN: And we sat down we talked. And he said, &quot;I think
we ought to put our differences behind us.&quot; And I did. And we worked
together to try to help human rights in Vietnam. To help the Buddhist end. A=
nd
to restore normal relations. Well, David, unfortunately, died at a very earl=
y
age.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>And I =85 feel so much better th=
at David and I had a reconciliation
and were able to work together. Look, I have differences with some of my
colleagues in the senate. And I&#39;m not close friends with some of them, t=
o say
the least. But I think it&#39;s important to, when you have differences, to =
put
them aside and move on. And that was hard for me to learn. But I finally did=
. I
think I&#39;m a better person for that.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><sp=
an>COURIC: I know, during your son&#39;s captivity, Mrs. McCain, you had
to believe in your heart that he had died to get through every day.</span><b=

died the first two
days.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Oh really?</span><br><s=

 when your
son was in captivity?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN:=
 Well, I do have faith. I have faith in God&#39;s will
and that&#39;s all I ask for. I don&#39;t have particular things I ask for. =
And if I profess
that I have faith then I have to do it. And it&#39;s like these =85 all thes=
e other
things, people, they go =85 those things weren&#39;t very hard for me.</span=
><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>I just =85 if you can&#39;t do something a=
bout something, don&#39;t waste
your time on it. And I couldn&#39;t do anything about that. I could maintain=
 my
dignity and the things that I&#39;d always claimed that I believed in, God a=
nd my
country. And I believe in the Vietnam War. And one pretty good proof about t=
he
domino theory is (unintelligible), Cambodia and Vietnam what today are
communist. And they weren&#39;t before the Vietnam War started.</span><br><s=
pan>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: Is it true, though, and Katie might =
be interested,
and that one of the things is that with most people you didn&#39;t talk abou=
t me.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh no. I never =
said a word to anybody.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Wasn&=
#39;t that hard?</span><br>
<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Well, why bring it up?</span><b=
r><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: How worried were you, Senator, about =
your mom and dad and
three young children?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: I =
was most worried about my family and that they
didn&#39;t know what was happening to me. And I think that was harder, in so=
me
ways, on my father because he was a commander of all the U.S. forces in the
Pacific. And, in 1972, he was told to bomb, order the bombing of B-52s in
Hanoi. And he knew that I lived in Hanoi.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><=
span>That my prison camp, one of them, was there. And, of course, he
carried out ... those instructions and gave the orders without hesitation. B=
ut
it&#39;s still pretty tough on a father, you know. I think, in some ways, th=
e
strain on him was ... in some ways more difficult and of greater.</span><br>=
<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh yeah. Every single night he =
prayed on his
knees. And I have =85 a prayer book of his, an Episcopal prayer book where, =
you
know, your hand finally will just be oil, and wear the paper out, those pape=
rs
are just worn out. They were just =85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span=
>JOHN MCCAIN: So it was tough on him. But he was a very brave
person and dedicated to the Navy. And I know it&#39;s maybe a little off the
subject, but it was a generation that he represented of the pre-World War II
Naval officer, military officer.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>They=
 all came from the same place. Either West Point or the Naval
Academy. And certainly they had their failings and flaws. But there was a
certain kind of-- apolitical attitude that most of that generation had of pr=
e
World War II military officers. My mom may dispute with me, but I think Herm=
an
Wolk&#39;s book-- Winds of War is one of-- and War and Remembrance is one of=
 those
great stories where you kind of get that flavor. I recommend it very-- very
highly. (Laughter) Don&#39;t you think?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><sp=
an>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yes. When he says that the military was
apolitical, it was. On an officer&#39;s (unintelligible) report they would p=
ut PI,
which meant political influence, and they scorned it. And that was a mark
against you. I don&#39;t ever remember politics being =85 discussed in my wh=
ole
married life.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: It&#39;s really=
 about honor, wasn&#39;t it?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCC=
AIN: And it =85 wasn&#39;t all perfect. We weren&#39;t ready for
World War II, as you know. That wasn&#39;t so much the military&#39;s fault,=
 but also
it was a kind of insularity. And it was good for the military, in my view, t=
o
take and have the officer corps from, frankly, all walks of society.</span><=
br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>From colleges and given more enlisted people=
. There were still
some. But more enlisted people to become officers. So I think, overall, it w=
as
an improvement. But there was kind of some unique qualities about the pre Wo=
rld
War II military officer that was very interesting and admirable.</span><br><=
span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Let&#39;s talk about politics and this c=
ampaign. As you both
know, Sen. McCain&#39;s age has been brought up quite a bit, because he will=
 be the
oldest president ever elected to a first term if he wins in November. Has yo=
ur
mom given you some good tips on staying fit?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><b=
r><span>John McCain: She certainly is an example I site quite frequently
(laughter) when the subject comes up. Obviously, as you can tell, she&#39;s =
in
excellent health. And I claim that I inherited all those genes from her.</sp=
an><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: You don&#39;t like when your son=
&#39;s age is brought up, do you?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROB=
ERTA MCCAIN: No. No, I don&#39;t mind. You know =85 in politics there
are pluses and there are minuses. And it&#39;s true. One year&#39;s old coul=
d have a
minus. But when you think about the experience, and what he&#39;s accomplish=
ed, and
the legislation that he&#39;s been able to get through, as opposed to a man =
who,
two years ago was in the state legislature at-- Illinois. So that is a big
minus in my view of =85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: =
That&#39;s why I have to take her with me wherever I go.</span><br><span>&nb=
sp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: With someone with so little experience. =
And then
who has the most liberal of record of voting in the United States. And I&#39=
;m no
liberal. So of course I think that it&#39;s over (unintelligible) on the Rep=
ublican
side.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: You speak your mind don=
&#39;t you? (Laughter) I know that,
back in January, you said the Republican base was offering no help whatsoeve=
r =85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: That&#39;s true=
.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: =85to your son. (Laughter) =
Now that he&#39;s become the nominee
do you think he&#39;s getting the help he needs?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</spa=
n><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: I don&#39;t know. I really don&#39;t know. And I=
&#39;m not
equivocating. I don&#39;t know anything about it.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</sp=
an><br><span>COURIC: Do you feel, though, that the Republican Party is behin=
d
him enough?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: I think t=
hey are a lot wiser than I am. And they
know =85 how to do this. I don&#39;t. So I really =85 and I&#39;m not really=
 trying to get
out of this. I =85 haven&#39;t thought about it. And I would assume that the=
y know
what they&#39;re doing, and they&#39;re doing the way that this should be ru=
n
politically.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Do you ever say,=
 &quot;Mom, please zip it!?&quot;</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROB=
ERT MCCAIN: It won&#39;t do him any good.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><=
span>JOHN MCCAIN: (Laughter) I was gonna say, I think at 96 she
probably has earned the right to express her views. And I think, Mom, if I
could just add on, I think our party =85 is united. I think we have a lot of=
 work
to do, obviously. But primaries are always tough. And =85 we&#39;re pretty m=
uch
together.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERT MCCAIN: Yeah. Well, =
I&#39;m =85 I don&#39;t know. I assume that it&#39;s
the way it should be.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Some of=
 your opponents, Senator, have said that you are
the equivalent of a third Bush term. How can you convince voters that you&#3=
9;re
not gonna be more of the same?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN M=
CCAIN: Well, obviously, a view of my record, which there has
been differences on climate change, or the war, or spending. But the importa=
nt
thing I think about every election, and this one probably more so than many
recently is that how we&#39;re gonna have a plan of action and vision for th=
e
future.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>Americans are going through a=
 very tough time now. Housing issue.
People are sitting around the kitchen table who have just lost their jobs
recently and suddenly. So I think they&#39;re very interested in what you ca=
n do to
help them better themselves and their lives and their futures. And I think
that&#39;s what most voters would focus on. And I have to give them that vis=
ion.
And I have the vision and the plan of action. But I&#39;ve got about six mon=
ths
now, I think, in order to convince them. And it&#39;s gonna be a tough job.<=
/span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: I know you&#39;ve talked abou=
t this, Sen. McCain, but =85 I want
to give you just a moment to clarify it. Often the criticism against you,
vis-=E0-vis Iraq, is that you&#39;re going to commit U.S. troops for an addi=
tional
100 years. What exactly did you say and why do you think that&#39;s been so
misinterpreted?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: What I w=
as saying and what I say today is that after
we win the war in Iraq, when they have an esca=85 a security arrangement wit=
h the
Iraqis after the Korean War we kept troops in South Korea. It was a buffer f=
or
our security.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>After the war in first =
Gulf War we have a base in Kuwait. It&#39;s not
American presence. It is American causalities that Americans care about. And
I&#39;m gonna win this war. And I&#39;m gonna bring our troops home and I&#3=
9;m gonna bring
them home honorably.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>And if we do wha=
t Sen. Obama and Sen. Clinton want to do, I am
convinced that we will be back with greater sacrifice of American blood and
treasure. And a year ago, Katie, I said to you I would much rather lose a
political campaign than lose a war. We are succeeding in Iraq. And I&#39;m n=
ot
going to take a course of action that I believe will endanger American lives
and cause us to have more sacrifice. And I&#39;m convinced to that.</span><b=
r><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: What do you say =85 a troop presence?=
 How many troops are we
talking about senator?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: I=
t would depend on the security arrangement. But,
again, it&#39;s =85 the same kind of deal we have with South Korea. We have =
with
Kuwait. We have with Japan. We have with Germany. We have troops, as the
world&#39;s super power, in a lot of places in the world.</span><br><span>&n=
bsp;</span><br><span>After the war is over, and it will be over, and we will=
 bring the
troops home with =85 honor and victory, then we will discuss those arrangeme=
nts
with the Iraqis, just as we did after the Korean War with the South Korean
government. And I don&#39;t know of anyone who objects to having American tr=
oops in
South Korea.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Mrs. McCain, you=
 were born before women had the right to
vote.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Yeah, that&#39;=
s right.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: And I&#39;m just cur=
ious how you feel about the first serious
female candidate for president of the United States, just the very notion of
that how...</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: I think i=
t&#39;s a wonderful idea. I don&#39;t see any
difference between a man and a woman. Except physically. They&#39;re stronge=
r than
we are but the rest of that I think that =85 what&#39;s happened with women =
and is
already been =85 proved. You don&#39;t have to argue about it.</span><br><sp=
an>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Have you talked to Sen. Clinton, Sen. McCa=
in, lately?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: Not recently=
, I haven&#39;t, Katie. I just haven&#39;t had
the chance to run into her.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Y=
ou think very highly of her.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCC=
AIN: I respect her. I respect Sen. Obama. And we intend to
run a respectful campaign.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Yo=
u and Sen. Clinton =85 had a noted drinking contest in
(Laughter) Estonia. And I understand she =85 drank you under the table. Is t=
hat
not right? Can you confirm that senator?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><s=
pan>JOHN MCCAIN: That is the most exaggerated story in history. We had
a drink together after a long day. And that was really all there was to it.
Really, that&#39;s all there was too it. I know it makes for exciting conver=
sation
but it just that just simply wasn&#39;t the case. But we did travel together=
. And
we&#39;ve worked together on the Armed Services Committee.</span><br><span>&=
nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Who would you rather run against? Sen. Clinton=
 or Sen.
Obama?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: It doesn&#39;t ma=
tter. I have no choice in the matter, so
we just have to run our own campaign. Each, according to some experts, have,
you know, but it&#39;s all gonna be about my campaign.</span><br><span>&nbsp=
;</span><br><span>COURIC: Some people say =85 the longer this goes on the mo=
re
damaging it is to the Democratic Party. Are you encouraging Sen. Clinton to
stay in the race? (Laughter)</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCC=
AIN: No, but, you know, I&#39;ve heard two sides of that
argument too Katie. One is that =85 the dissention between the two of them =
=85
helps me in =85 that the differences that are exploited between them. The ot=
her
argument I hear is, well, they&#39;re out there motivating people to registe=
r as
Democrats.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>And motivating their base =
of =85 So I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the right
answer. But I =85 think, also, that most Americans really start focusing
political campaigns after the conventions. Which is, you know, the end of
august, the beginning of September. And then I think they&#39;ll be focusing=
 a lot
=85 on our campaigns and making judgments of that. Just as in the primaries,=
 as
you might recall, people really didn&#39;t start focusing until after Labor =
Day
this last year.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: What is the m=
ost exciting part about the potential of
having your son in the White House?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>R=
OBERT MCCAIN: I don&#39;t have any.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>C=

<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: How about being able to go to =85 =
any of the museums
any time day or night? How&#39;s that?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><spa=
n>ROBERTA MCCAIN: That&#39;s another matter.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><b=

son&#39;s potential presidency?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBER=
TA MCCAIN: I&#39;m amazed =85 how well rounded he is on so many
subjects. When =85 just out of the blue people ask him questions =85 and he =
knows
as much as he knows. Honey, everything about the McCain family is just 100
percent (unintelligible) right or wrong =85 that&#39;s it.</span><br><span>&=
nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: But could I also, in the interest of full=
 disclosure,
mention that, from time to time, we have spirited discussions.</span><br><sp=
an>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh yes.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</sp=
an><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: Because we don&#39;t always agree.</span><br><span=
>&nbsp;</span><br>
<span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: We do have. (Laughter)</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><b=
r><span>COURIC: What is the biggest issue of disagreement?</span><br><span>&=
nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: It&#39;s such =85 I&#39;m not gonna wo=

<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC You can&#39;t tell me?</span><br><span>&=
nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: No.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><=

<span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: What are these big issues?</span><br><s=
pan>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: Oh no, hey look, hey look. One th=
ing about my mom,
she really does keep up. She watches the news. She reads the newspaper. She
carries them around with me. And so it&#39;s kind of issue of the day kind o=
f thing
when we=85</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: That&#39;s=
 right.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: =85when we discu=

we&#39;re pretty well in tune. (Laughter)</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><=

OHN MCCAIN: Oh yeah =85 and I think its fun. Because I think it&#39;s
wonderful =85 that she is this well informed. And she mentioned that, at a v=
ery
early age, she got married to a naval officer. I challenge you there&#39;s h=
ardly a
museum or a church in Europe that she doesn&#39;t know or hasn&#39;t visited=
. And I
mean it. She has really enriched her life by studying, reading and travel. A=
nd
I&#39;m proud. And she still does it.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span=
>COURIC: At 96 you&#39;re still doing it?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><=

to go to the Metropolitan ...</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC:=
 You&#39;re amazing.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: =
No =85 do you want me to sit around and play bridge
every day? Or discuss my last knee replacement? (Laughter) Or pass around
pictures of my grandchildren? Well, that isn&#39;t my choice of a way to liv=
e. I
love to. That&#39;s one reason I live in Washington is art museums are open =
seven
days a week, and they&#39;re all free, and you can&#39;t say that about anot=
her city in
the world.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: That&#39;s ni=
ce. That&#39;s nice.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>ROBERTA MCCAIN: =
It&#39;s true.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: Finally, Sen. =
McCain, if I could ask you a day-of-news
story, you know, Myanmar has been in the news should much. If you were
president, what would you do to convince the military government to allow
international aid into that country to help the thousands - perhaps millions=
 -
of people who have been displaced by this?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br>=
<span>JOHN MCCAIN: Did I mention one of the great honors of my life was,
a long time ago, I had the incredible honor of meeting (unintelligible) in
Burma. There&#39;s no greater living person in the world today, you know, wh=
o has
sacrificed so much for her country.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>I=
 think (unintelligible) and China have great influence over
Burma. I would start putting some pressures on their appealing to them to ha=
ve
this (unintelligible) at least allowing aid to care for these people. It&#39=
;s
really awful. It&#39;s an awful government when they have to find out that o=
ne of
these catastrophes is happening by outside radio and not even warn their own
people. They find out by outside communications. This is a very bad governme=
nt.
And right now I think that we should ask the other countries in the region, =
as
well as China, that they have close ties to, to really put some pressure on
them for humanitarian purposes.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURI=
C: Do you think enough is being done about it?</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span>=
<br><span>JOHN MCCAIN: I don&#39;t know. The Chinese have an imagine problem
right now, as we know, over Tibet. I think we could tell them that it would
help their reputation if they weighed in heavily to =85 get the=85 I use the=
 word
government loosely=85 to help =85 let assistance come in this humanitarian e=
ffort.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>COURIC: It&#39;s Mother&#39;s =

ENTRY:Alright, let&#39;s talk about this major speech that
he&#39;s gonna be making on climate change today [...]Ok, the environment re=
ality
check here. I just want to throw two polls at you quickly. LA Times/Bloomber=
g
Poll saying 4% of the people say the environment is a top concern, very smal=
l
percentage. Then just today, another poll comes out today, a Gallup Poll, fi=
nds
that 38% of likely voters saying McCain&#39;s association with Bush makes th=
em less
likely to vote for McCain. Why is he talking about the environment, is this
more about disassociating himself with the Bush administration?</span><br><s=
pan>&nbsp;</span><br><span>JOE LIEBERMAN: Well I think he&#39;s taking about=
 the environment,
particularly climate change, because he cares about it and if you ask John
McCain what are some of the things he most wants to accomplish as president,
one is to get America back into global leadership and to do something about
global warming [...]John McCain&#39;s willingness to step out early, five or=
 six
years ago, when he and I introduced the first really significant anti-global
warming bill in the Senate, I think is not only one of the reasons why I
crossed party lines to support him but one of the reasons why I think a lot =
of
Democrats and independents are gonna do the same. And it&#39;s certainly put=
s the
lie to this argument that John McCain is just George Bush over again. Presid=
ent
Bush with all respect, has pulled out, pulled America out of the global war
against Global Warming, John McCain will put us back into the leadership of =
it
and that&#39;s where we must be.</span><br><span>[...]</span><br><span>CHENT=
RY: Alright well let&#39;s step aside from the polls and talk
subject matter. Obviously the Iraq war, he continues to embrace that. This i=
s
high on the agenda of the American people. I just returned from Baghdad and
what was interesting to me, I sat down with dozens of Iraqi soldiers and doz=
ens
of students at Baghdad University, and Senator they said to me &#39;we don&#=
39;t want
to see a Republican president.&#39; Matter of fact out of every single one I=
 talked
to, only person said they supported John McCain. They said &#39;we&#39;re li=
ving a
Republican war, look at this, it&#39;s a disaster. We want to see a Democrat=
 for
president.&#39; What does John McCain say to the future of Iraq when we&#39;=
re talking
about Iraqi soldiers and Baghdad University students? They&#39;re the ones l=
iving
this.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>LIEBERMAN: Well I&#39;m real su=
rprised to hear that.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>CHENTRY: I was =
too. It was very interesting, they were very blunt
and very straight forward.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>LIEBERMAN:=
 Not that I expect the Iraqis to vote in our election.
But I will tell you in all the visits I&#39;ve made there, and its eight, th=
e Iraqi
people on the street, the Iraqi military, the Iraqi government that I&#39;ve=
 talked
to don&#39;t want us to just pick up and leave. Because, which is what Senat=
or
Obama and Senator Clinton have been advocating. They want us obviously not t=
o
stay there forever. Senator McCain wants the war to stop and have us pull ba=
ck
into bases and be on a path, a reasonable path of withdrawal. I think the Ir=
aqi
people more than anybody know they&#39;ve made tremendous progress in the la=
st year
and half toward security, toward economic rebirth, toward some kind of
political national reconciliation. And the last thing they want us to do in =
&#39;09
is just to pick up begin to retreat because they&#39;ll be the victims, they=
&#39;ll be
genocide, they&#39;ll be blood shed. Iran and Al Qaeda will win and we&#39;l=
l lose. And
so I&#39;m surprised at what your unscientific poll found and I honestly don=
&#39;t
think it reflects the feelings of most Iraqis, certainly the ones on the str=
eet
that I&#39;ve met when I&#39;ve been there.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br=
><span>CHENTRY: Final question, it&#39;s in the news, Myanmar. McCain has
been very vocal about human rights abuses there. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;re=
 well aware
of over the weekend, Doug Goodyear, the PR exec that was hired to run the RN=

How did that slip through the cracks? And do you think that John McCain shou=

Democrats and independents are gonna cross party lines to support him. John =

a problem. He spent some time studying it, he decided global warming. He cam=

to me about six years ago and said let&#39;s get together and do something a=
bout
this. And we put together the first significant anti-global warming bill. A
bill that uses market mechanisms to move us slowly down in terms of our
greenhouse gas emissions. And I think John today is gonna talk about that an=

why he as president will make this a priority of his administration [...]</s=

I&#39;d say that this is who he is. He&#39;s independently minded. You know,=

the importanant thing to say is that uh, the gas tax holiday that John McCai=

is proposing for the summer is not his energy policy that is a kind of help =
to
lower and middle income families to save a little money over the summer... h=
e
is going to reveal a very bold climate change policy. He is against global
warming and in dealing with global warming policy as independently as he has
the McCain program will be the most significant energy independence program
that America has every adopted it will be the moon shot, the Apollo project
that everybody has said we need for energy because it will break our depende=

have to get to the point of moving in anyway into Iran to strike at the base=

the Media</i></b> (FNC 05/12/08 7:00am)</span><br><span>GRETCHEN CARLSON: Jo=
hn McCain, and apparently there are seven
steps now, that at least some newspaper columnists are suggesting that McCai=
n
will use against Barack Obama to beat him in November. The first one, being
kind of an obvious one I guess, that he will paint Obama as a false messiah.=
 In
other words, the unfulfilled prophet. And I think what he&#39;ll do is inste=
ad of
using his age as negative, he&#39;ll say my age means I&#39;m experienced.</=
span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><br><span>STEVE DOOCY: Well Steve Schmidt, who i=
s one of McCain&#39;s advisers,
says regarding the lofty rhetoric that Barack Obama uses in every speech, it=
&#39;s
all non-sense. That&#39;s what Steve Schmidt says. Says, you know, he&#39;s =
talking
about change but what&#39;s he gonna change and he&#39;s gonna change it? [.=
..] All
seven of these are detailed in the brand new Time magazine. Number two is wo=
rk
and woo and win the referees. And what they&#39;re talking about his the med=
ia. And
in fact John McCain has just restarted the straight talk express where he&#3=
9;ll
hop in the bus , have a couple three four different reporters in the back, a=
nd
they&#39;ll just chat for hundreds of miles.</span><br><span>&nbsp;</span><b=

story for that reporter. And of course usually they say &#39;wow I feel like=
 an
insider&#39; and write something more positive, it worked before. This is so=
mething
they&#39;re making a lot of progress on is number three. Get Barack Obama in=
 a Town
Hall setting. This is a proposal put out there by the McCain camp [...]</spa=

low road. But this one will be an interesting one for McCain because you kno=

he&#39;s gone on record as saying he would not make Barack Obama&#39;s Rever=

an issue in the November election [...] When they&#39;re going up against ea=
