Kristi,
=20
Nice work.  I read the verbaitms and saw that some folks linked age with =
temper -- you know, old and cranky.  The press is highly attuned to this =
narrative and will look for ways to link it.  But I think a more =
productive linkage has been suggested by John Podesta:  Old and set in =
his ways - specifically, as John says, "It's not even that he's set in =
his ways.  It's that he's set in Bush's ways."  It links McCain to Bush, =
raises the age issue, and makes him implausible as an agent of change.  =
But nobody comes to it on their own.  You might consider a way of =
raising that argument in future groups.
=20
Thanks a lot,
=20
Paul

Tonight's groups in Cincinnati were composed of:

=20

*Women, older, non college, income under 50K, weak partisans; 5 of who =
voted for Bush. 4 Kerry, and 1 who voted for neither but leaned =
Democrat.

=20

*Men, Independents and Democrats who were either Undecided and warm =
towards McCain or weak McCain supporters.  Seven of the ten men voted =
for Kerry in 2004.=20

=20

=20

McCain's initial standing in tonight's groups was quite strong.  The raw =
impressions participants brought to the groups were mostly positive and =
three major attributes stood out consistently.  First, McCain was =
universally respected as a war hero and admired for his military =
service, sacrifice, and love of country.  Second, participants saw =
McCain as an experienced and strong leader.  And third, McCain was =
repeatedly applauded for being a straight talker who stands by his =
convictions, even if they are unpopular.  Nothing here is a surprise, =
but when I went through all of the handouts the repetition was =
remarkable.  The only universal concern that participants initially had =
about McCain was his age and health.  Participants were not overly aware =
of McCain's hot temper, but it was raised in both groups.

=20

Some participants initially had questions about McCain's ability to =
bring change and some wondered if his policies would be a continuation =
of Bush.  However, most did not make this conclusion on their own at the =
outset of the groups.  It seems that McCain's brand (war hero, =
experience, straight talker) was so defined for these participants that =
they lacked clarity on his actual policies.  Indeed, participants needed =
a push tonight to derive that McCain is not going to bring the change =
they seek and that he will continue the Bush agenda.

=20

On the economy, participants were extremely troubled by McCain's =
assertion that he doesn't understand the economy and the fundamentals =
are strong.  This was true especially in the group of lower income women =
where many were struggling with rising costs and job losses.  As we =
heard in the last Dcorps groups, these participants tonight were very =
concerned about the economic future but also angry about the economic =
disparity.  That's why the hit on McCain defending his opposition to min =
wage by saying he had forgone a pay raise causing his own family =
hardships has potential.  One woman said, "he doesn't have a clue what =
it is like to live on dollars for an hour."  And another chimed in, =
"yeah, that's where economics comes in.  Take a class."  These =
participants think McCain is out of touch with their reality and =
therefore how can he improve their situation?  In addition, they said =
that being president is not the time to "learn the ropes." Participants =
were mostly unforgiving about McCain's recent economic blunders.  McCain =
may be a straight talker on the economy, but he is dead wrong.

=20

When it came to Iraq though, participants were a bit more willing to =
give McCain the benefit of the doubt.  They mostly trusted his military =
expertise and also his commitment to America- there was this sense that =
he always does what is in the best interests of the country.  But =
participants were concerned upon learning that McCain wants to continue =
the war and will keep the troops in Iraq indefinitely.  The key here is =
that McCain wants to continue the war, though.  Again, participants =
defended McCain with the 100 years attacks because they made a clear =
distinction between a US presence in Iraq and an active war.  They were =
OK with a presence like Korea and actually thought it was important, but =
they were wary of continuing the war that includes fatalities and =
trillions being spent in Bagdad.  (On a side note- the 1000 years figure =
is not credible.  Must use 100 years).  Participants were very receptive =
to the priorities hit, especially when they visualized their kids and =
grandkids fighting in Iraq and they think money is being wasted over in =
Iraq that could be used at home.  The ads and the narrative attacks need =
to draw these conclusions for them, though.  McCain may be a straight =
talker on Iraq, but he is dead wrong.

=20

Participants also found some of the facts that discredit the straight =
talker image altogether.  From his flip flop on Bush tax cuts to =
immigration to abortion, participants were very surprised to learn that =
McCain has changed his position so drastically.  In addition, both the =
hits on his ties to big oil and lobbyists were eye opening and =
disturbing to the group.  As one participant said, "He has more baggage =
than I thought."  Some of this also helps tie him to Bush.  As one =
participant said, "He's [McCain] an oil man, that's his bread and butter =
and that's why he has an interest in these big oil companies over here, =
that's his interest, him and Bush."  One by one, these facts mounted a =
case against the straight talker and muddled the image of him.  At the =
end, more participants admitted that they really didn't know where =
McCain stood on a number of issues.

=20

***

Again, I apologize about the webcasting failure in the first group.  For =
those of you who were planning to watch in the coming days, you will not =
be able to watch it online, but I have a DVD of both groups which I can =
get to you.  The second group though is available for you to watch =
online right now.

=20

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for tomorrow night.

=20

thanks, Kristi=20
