Hi John-

They'd like to send out the below dinner with Hillary contest emails
on Tuesday. They really went big with your mom's story! Let me know
how these look to you.

Thanks,
Milia

Subject: My mother's cooking

Friend --

My mother loved to cook.

It was a long-standing tradition for her to cook for the politicians
and candidates that I=E2=80=99ve worked with. Everyone had a good time with=
 it
-- not many people wanted to miss out on my mother's cooking.

In addition to being a hell of a chef, my mother had a top-notch BS
detector -- she didn't always like the politicians she had dinner
with. But let me tell you: She loved Hillary.

My mother got to see what a genuine, passionate person Hillary is. She
got to know Hillary, and I know she would be first in line to support
her for president.

I want you to get to know Hillary the way my mother got to know her --
that's why we're flying out a few supporters and their guests to have
a private dinner with Hillary. Enter today to be one of them:

Believe me when I tell you that you do not want to miss out on this. Good l=
uck!

Thanks,

John

P.S. We'll pick up your airfare and accommodations, in addition to
your dinner tab. <link>All you have to worry about is entering.</link>
