Hi John,



I hope this finds you well and that you're feeling energized by being back
on the campaign trail!



Pav and I are now back in California and I am reaching out to folks in the
private sector. I had a great conversation with Sarah Wartell about my
interest in financial inclusion and she put me in touch with a few very
helpful contacts. I recently learned that Lisa Jackson has been named the
new head of Policy and Social Initiatives at Apple.  In my pursuit of
finding something in the field of financial inclusion, I have been in touch
with several people in the Apple Pay group; all have suggested that I get
in touch with Lisa. If you think it is appropriate, I was hoping you might
be able to introduce me to her. I'm happy to draft a short email if you
agree.



Thank you so much for your help - and please let me know when you're in the
Bay Area. We'd love to see you!



-Teresita
