That's a great idea.  I'll talk with Carrie on this too.

Can we have Cicilline and Kennedy help with this?
Or have Raimundo in RI?

Good evening everyone-
I wanted to draw your attention to a few top items.

1.  NEA is concerned their VT affiliate could do a Tuesday (next week)
recommendation of endorsement (with potential press release).  This is not
confirmed.  The bigger concern is that RI and MA might go with VT as well.
MA holds significant weight on their PAC committee.  This doesn't pose
serious concern for the NEA overall endorsement, its a optics problem
headed into the RA.  NH NEA is poised to endorse HRC, but so far that
affiliate is the only one we know ready to go.  Iowa is not there yet.  I
am working with Carrie Pugh on options to head this off.  On Monday night,
NEA is hosting a member teletown hall where we'll know more on where
members and leaders are currently.

I'm working on options for outreach to NEA and state affiliates for you to
consider very soon.  Please let me know any guidance you might have here.

2.  The IAFF endorsement is moved to September 2015.  They are able to
schedule a date anytime after their Redmond Conference at the end of
August.  This would be a event scheduled in Iowa.

Trade Update:
Focus continues on the 14 Senate Democrats that voted for TPA/TAA in the
Senate.  Top targets are Shaheen, Bennett, Coons, Heitkamp, Cantwell and
Warner.  Shaheen is giving labor the most heart burn.  Cloture vote is
still expected on Tuesday.  Special note, because of the trade movement in
both chambers the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (top priority for
NEA/AFT) vote has been pushed in the Senate to August.
