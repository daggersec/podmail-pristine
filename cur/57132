Good point.

This is the quote so maybe we should change the speech to read:  "I=E2=80=
=99ve been
told to stop shouting about ending gun violence.  Some are threatening to g=
o
after me for speaking out on this issue.  But I won=E2=80=99t be silenced, =
and I
hope you won=E2=80=99t be either.  How many more people have to die before =
we take
action?

"We had to fire a shot across their bow, because they were going to start
to have their way with us," Devine told me. "I pushed [Sanders] hard to do
what he did to let them know, if they're going to do this stuff that two of
the 12,000 votes he cast in Congress about guns are the definitive votes of
the election=E2=80=94and oh, by the way, she is yelling because she's a wom=
an. If
they are going to start going down that road, we are not going to take it.
And it is going to be about a lot of issues where she's gone from one place
to another. We did five of them [at the J-J] and we could do 15 more."
