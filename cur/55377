My suggestion would be that we tell Tom we really need his help with the =
hard $ during the primary election - perhaps he focuses on us =
exclusively until end of 2015, then re-evaluate and he could switch over =
to non-federal side after that.

Depends on whether we would give him something official, like California =
co-chair. He was prepared to fund NextGen Action and leave it to Ted and =
Josh to run and stay on the hard $ side. I think if we don't make a move =
and ask him to do something specific, he'll stay in the NextGen world.
