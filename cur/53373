Inhofe: Sotomayor Is a 'Racist,' But Strom Thurmond Is A 'Great American' <=
http://thinkprogress.org/2009/08/05/inhofe-sotomayor-racist/>

Echoing statements by nativist former Rep. Tom Tancredo<http://thinkprogres=
s.org/2009/05/27/tancredo-sotomayor-racist/> (R-CO) and former KKK Imperial=
 Wizard David Duke<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/06/01/david-duke-limbaugh/=
>, Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) called Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotoma=
yor a "racist<http://blogs.cqpolitics.com/legal_beat/2009/08/gop-senator-sa=
ys-sotomayors-sp.html>" today on the Senate floor.  Watch it:

[YOUTUBE]

Interestingly, while Inhofe is convinced that the first Latina nominee to t=
he Supreme Court is consumed by racial animus, he had very different things=
 to say about a fellow Southern white conservative.  After former Sen. Tren=
t Lott (R-MS) claimed that America would have avoided "all these problems<h=
ttp://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/09/lott.comment/>" if it had put=
 a segregationist in the White House, Inhofe quickly came to Lott's defense=
<http://inhofe.senate.gov/pressapp/record.cfm?id=3D189187>:

"In an effort to honor the life and service of Strom Thurmond, Senator Lott=
 made some comments that he probably wishes he had phrased differently," In=
hofe said. "I do not believe Senator Lott meant to be malicious or racist w=
ith the comments he made. I believe he was merely honoring a great American=
 on his 100th birthday, but I believe he is right to apologize for the word=
s he used. Racism of any type must not be tolerated.

"Many have been quick to criticize Lott, but few have been quick to accept =
his apology. I do not believe he harbors racist sentiments in his heart. He=
 has apologized and appropriately clarified the meaning of his statements. =
I believe we should accept his apology and move forward."

In Jim Inhofe's America, Sonia Sotomayor is a dangerous bigot who must be s=
topped, but Strom Thurmond is a "great American."
