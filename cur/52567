Hopefully Podesta will see quickly that someone needs to be on the road wit=
h her that tells her to take her sunglasses off, introduce herself and talk=
 to everyone she can when she stops to eat and has the opportunity to speak=
 one-on-one with voters.  There is a hyper focus on her and she needs to ge=
t these simple things right.
