 *The Obama Administration Did Not Open More Areas of Public Lands for Coal
Mining*



=C2=B7         The Buffalo Resources Management Plan (RMP) does *not* open =
up
new areas to future coal leasing. The areas that are available for leasing
under the RMP have not changed for 30 years.



=C2=B7         The purpose of the Buffalo Resource Management Plan is to pr=
ovide
balanced management of all of the resources in the area including wildlife
habitat, ranching, recreation, conservation and mineral development.



=C2=B7         The RMP does *not* authorize any specific leases or mining
operations.  Any new coal leases would require environmental reviews
specific to the particular lease application.



*PRIVATE TALKING POINTS*



*The Administration is Committed to Modernizing Our Federal Coal Program
and Making Sure American Taxpayers are Getting a Fair Deal*



=C2=B7         DOI is working to complete a set of reforms to its coal prog=
rams
prior to the end of the Administration.



=C2=B7         These include actions =E2=80=93 such as the Stream Protectio=
n Rule =E2=80=93 to
address the environmental impacts of coal mining.  They also include
reforms to make sure American taxpayers are getting a fair deal, including
a rule that was proposed in January 2015 to make reforms to how coal is
valued for royalty purposes.



*These BLM Plans Are One of the Greatest Single Conservation Efforts Ever
(NGO)*



=C2=B7         These BLM plans are one of the greatest single conservation
efforts by an administration ever. They include 16 million acres where
future mining is restricted and 66 million acres of other types of habitat
protection. This collaboration between federal and state agencies, local
partners and landowners that led to the plan is an essential part of an
overall strategy to protect the Endangered Species Act, a bedrock
environmental law. This complex effort was not the time or the place to
also make changes to the coal leasing program.



*ADDITIONAL PRIVATE TALKING POINTS* [This is to respond to a specific
additional claim in Roberts=E2=80=99 blog:
http://www.vox.com/2015/5/29/8687659/public-land-coal-leases]



*Question*: But doesn=E2=80=99t the RMP say that BLM "has estimated that it=
 would
issue 28 coal leases encompassing 106,400 acres with approximately 10.2
billion tons of coal."



*Answer*:  Correct.  The RMP does estimate that BLM would issue 28 new
leases; however, that estimate was based on a conservative development
scenario that by definition was designed to represent the maximum level of
development.  The RMP does *not* authorize any specific leases or mining
operations.  Any new coal lease would require an application from industry
and additional lease-specific environmental reviews.  Additionally, it is
highly unlikely the RMP=E2=80=99s reasonably foreseeable development scenar=
io will
be realized over the life of the new plan, as BLM has only issued leases
encompassing 44,000 acres since 2001.



*Background*: The EIS, prepared as part of the RMP process, used a
"reasonably forseeable development scenario" (required by NEPA), which
assumed 28 new leases and 106,400 acres and 10.2 billion tons of coal =E2=
=80=93 the
source of Roberts=E2=80=99 claim.  It does not authorize any specific lease=
 sales.
The purpose of these scenarios in the NEPA context is to consider the
maximum possible development during the life of the RMP so that the
environmental analysis supporting the plan is as robust as possible.  It is
highly unlikely that actual development during the period of the new plan
will be anywhere close to this number of leases or acres.
