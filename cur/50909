PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION FUND CELEBRATES 26 NEW PRO-CHOICE CONGRESSIONALS
 Pro-Planned Parenthood Senators and Representatives Win Elections

The Planned Parenthood Action
Fund<http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/index.htm>applauds the 26
new pro-Planned Parenthood and pro-choice senators and
representatives who have won election to the 111th Congress.

*"All across the country, supporters of women's health and rights won key
congressional and Senate races. From Dina Titus, a new congresswoman-elect
from Clark County to Kay Hagan, the new senator-elect from North Carolina,
and important seats in between, voters across America voted for change and
voted for women's health," said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned
Parenthood Action Fund.*

Overall, Planned Parenthood Action Fund-endorsed candidates won 51
congressional seats in targeted
races<http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/campaigns/226.htm>.
The 111th Congress will have at least 26 new pro-Planned Parenthood and
pro-choice members, with a handful of races still to be decided.

*"We look forward to working with all the new members of Congress on
promoting and protecting women's health. We especially celebrate the 26 new
members who support women's health and rights," said Richards.*

Notably, New Mexico will have an all-pro-choice congressional delegation,
with wins by Martin Heinrich (NM-01), Harry Teague, (NM-02) and Ben Lujan
(NM-03).

*"Women and families are the real winners in this election," Richards said.
"The number of new pro-choice and pro-women's health members of Congress
represents a major step toward getting our country back on track and
ensuring that our lawmakers have the right priorities, like support for
women's health care."*

The Planned Parenthood Action Fund's One Million Strong
Campaign<http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/index.htm>mobilized
one million pro-choice, pro-women's health voters across the
country to vote for women's health. The Planned Parenthood Action Fund
targeted key states with aggressive grassroots efforts in Florida, Georgia,
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.

The Planned Parenthood Action Fund also launched a mail program targeting
undecided women voters who are concerned about women's health in five Senat=
e
races =96Georgia, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Oregon =96
sending more than two million pieces of mail to more than 536,000 voters,
and helping propel Kay Hagan and Jeanne Shaheen to victory. The Planned
Parenthood Action Fund also launched mail and grassroots programs in key
congressional races, helping Dina Titus (NV-03), Alan Grayson (FL-08), and
Suzanne Kosmas (FL-24) win tough victories in contested districts.

In addition, voters rejected right-wing-sponsored ballot
initiatives<http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/campaigns/290.htm>in
South Dakota, Colorado, and California =96 measures that sought to
undermine women and families' rights to make personal health care
decisions.
