Dear John,
=20
The Republicans are coming at us from every possible direction =E2=80=93 he=
alth care, women's freedom to choose, workers' rights, environmental protec=
tion.
=20
If I could choose anyone to be my partner in fighting these battles, it wou=
ld be Kirsten Gillibrand.
=20
Kirsten has proven herself to be a dogged defender of equal rights and comm=
itted to bringing relief to Americans who are struggling in this challengin=
g economy. I know I can count on her to never back down, even in the face o=
f extremist opponents.
=20
All of us have benefited so much from having Kirsten in the U.S. Senate, so=
 all of us need to do whatever we can to keep her there. Please join me in =
supporting Kirsten's 2012 re-election bid by making a donation before the e=
nd-of-quarter deadline. She needs to raise $100,000 before March 31 so she =
can start this race in the best position possible.

is is the first important filing deadline for Kirsten, and she needs to mak=
e as strong a showing as possible. [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/=

]
*=20
It's distressing to watch what the Republicans are doing. By attacking wome=
n's reproductive rights, preventing collective bargaining and standing in t=
he way of health care for all, they're trying to demolish years and years o=
f progress.
=20
But even as some veer towards a dangerous radicalism, Kirsten sticks to her=
 progressive principles. She doesn't base her beliefs on anything except wh=
at she knows to be right and just. That's why she's staying the course on t=
hings such as marriage equality and freedom of choice.
=20
We need to keep Kirsten in the Senate, but the only way we can is if all of=
 us join together today. With your help we can show the pundits that the gr=
assroots are behind Kirsten and she's going to have the resources she needs=
 to fight the tough battle ahead. The Republicans sure aren't going to make=
 it easy =E2=80=93 so these early months are critical.

I think we can all agree that Kirsten has already done so much for the stat=
e of New York and America as a whole during her time in the Senate. I've no=
 doubt she'll continue that impressive record moving forward.

Sincerely,
=20
