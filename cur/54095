Glenn Beck called hurricane survivors in New Orleans "scumbags," said he
"hates" 9-11 families

September 09, 2005 6:24 pm ET


Nationally syndicated Clear Channel radio host Glenn Beck
<http://mediamatters.org/issues_topics/people/glennbeck>  referred to
survivors of Hurricane Katrina who remained in New Orleans as
"scumbags." Also, after acknowledging that nobody "in their right mind
is going to say this out loud," Beck attacked victims of the disaster in
general and the families of victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks, saying: "I didn't think I could hate victims faster than the
9-11 victims."

From the September 9 broadcast of The Glenn Beck Program:=20

BECK: Let me be real honest with you. I don't think anybody on talk
radio -- I don't think anybody in their right mind is going to say this
out loud -- but I wonder if I'm the only one that feels this way.
Yesterday, when I saw the ATM cards being handed out, the $2,000 ATM
cards, and they were being handed out at the Astrodome. And they
actually had to close the Astrodome and seal it off for a while because
there was a near-riot trying to get to these ATM cards. My first thought
was, it's not like they're going to run out of the $2,000 ATM cards. You
can wait! You know, stand in line. Maybe it's because I'm the kind of
guy, when I go to a buffet, I either have to be first in line, or I'm
the very last. Because I know there's going to be extra food, and I just
won't stand in the line. I'll wait until all the suckers go get their
food, and then I'll go get mine. Or if I'm really hungry, I hate to
admit this -- and really, I don't even have to be really hungry. If I'm
really being a pig, I will kind of, like, hang out around the buffet
table before the line is -- you know, chat with people right around the
table: "Oh, they just opened the line! Let's go!" And then you're first
in line.

When you are rioting for these tickets, or these ATM cards, the second
thing that came to mind was -- and this is horrible to say, and I wonder
if I'm alone in this -- you know it took me about a year to start hating
the 9-11 victims' families? Took me about a year. And I had such
compassion for them, and I really wanted to help them, and I was behind,
you know, "Let's give them money, let's get this started." All of this
stuff. And I really didn't -- of the 3,000 victims' families, I don't
hate all of them. Probably about 10 of them. And when I see a 9-11
victim family on television, or whatever, I'm just like, "Oh shut up!"
I'm so sick of them because they're always complaining. And we did our
best for them. And, again, it's only about 10.=20

But the second thought I had when I saw these people and they had to
shut down the Astrodome and lock it down, I thought: I didn't think I
could hate victims faster than the 9-11 victims. These guys -- you know
it's really sad. We're not hearing anything about Mississippi. We're not
hearing anything about Alabama. We're hearing about the victims in New
Orleans. This is a 90,000-square-mile disaster site, New Orleans is 181
square miles. A hundred and -- 0.2 percent of the disaster area is New
Orleans! And that's all we're hearing about, are the people in New
Orleans. Those are the only ones we're seeing on television are the
scumbags -- and again, it's not all the people in New Orleans. Most of
the people in New Orleans got out! It's just a small percentage of those
who were left in New Orleans, or who decided to stay in New Orleans, and
they're getting all the attention. It's exactly like the 9-11 victims'
families. There's about 10 of them that are spoiling it for everybody.=20
