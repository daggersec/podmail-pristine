John --

The moral obligation to act on climate change has never been
clearer.

We've already seen record storms and droughts, heat waves,
floods, and wildfires. And this extreme weather is only
going to get worse if we don't act to protect our public
health and future generations.

In advance of the international climate negotiations coming
up in Paris in December, President Obama is making sure that
every country commits to doing its fair share to cut carbon
pollution. Here in the U.S., that means adopting the Clean
Power Plan, which places the first-ever limits on carbon
pollution from power plants.

Unfortunately, climate change deniers and big polluters are
already trying to stand in the way of that progress. We
can't let that happen.

Add your name to say you support the Clean Power Plan:

https://my.barackobama.com/Support-The-CPP

Earlier this week, several senators introduced bills
that would not only block the Clean Power Plan, but could
block any similar carbon pollution standards for power
plants permanently.

Climate deniers are risking too much, and we can't accept
it.

Stand up for strong action on climate change -- support the
Clean Power Plan now:

Thanks,

Jack
