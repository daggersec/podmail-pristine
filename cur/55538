"Kirkpatrick is smart. She's tough. She's a good campaigner with a track =
record in Congress. Her views will provide a counterpoint to McCain's =
positions, giving voters a real choice." -- The Arizona Republic, 5/26/15

We couldn't have said it better myself, John.

Ann is exactly the kind of senator Arizona families need. She was born =
here. She raised her family here. And she has the experience, integrity, =
and vision for our state's future.

But politics these days isn't only about which candidate is the best =
choice, it's also about who has the strongest supporter network. And I =
want that to be us.

Tomorrow is the last day to reach our $20,000 goal for the month of May. =
Give $5 or more before our deadline at midnight to help build our network =
grow.
