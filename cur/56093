::: ProgressNow - Building the online progressive movement state by state :=
::=20



Dear friends,

At ProgressNow and ProgressNow Education, we are working closely with
our partners every single day. Whether it's shoulder-to-shoulder
on the ground in our 21-state network and nationally as we combine our
brain power to strategize on progressive victory. We are connecting,
collaborating and contacting voters - together.

This update lays out just a few of the ways we're more than
getting by with help from our friends. I know you'll enjoy
hearing about how we're working smarter, more efficiently and
getting things done.

As always, we'd love to hear from you about what ProgressNow and
ProgressNow Education are doing and should be doing.

Onward - together!

Denise Cardinal
Executive Director

Infusing Romney's Rhetoric with State-Based Facts

Working closely with our friends at the Center for American Progress
Action Fund, we are helping them in their 16-city tour of Romney
University - a fact-based tutorial for local media and activists
about the cost of Romney's policy for their communities. Most
recently, we were in Virginina - you can read about the event
here.

Standing up for Miners in Romney Ad

ProgressOhio is working with SEIU and Fight for a Fair Economy leaders
and local organizations to make sure the public knows about how the
Ohio miners featured in a Romney ad were not paid for the work time
they had to take to be in this ad. Progress Ohio has filed a complaint
with the FEC about the miners being in the ad against their own will
- and how it violates campaign finance law. You can read about
the complaint here

Akin Steps In It - AGAIN - and We Make It Messy

Collaborating on the ground, our ProgressMissouri affiliate worked
with Planned Parenthood, labor groups and community organizations to
stir the pot. To the point where he had to stop his bus tour stop and
turn it into a press conference to deal with the protestors (that
outnumbered his own supporters at the rally). You can read about it
here.

Overnight coverage of Todd Akin's latest headache:
http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3Dwh3J13PTDiTCW1n4OQi1yA

"What was supposed to be a 90-minute rally as part of Akin's
"Missouri Common Sense Bus Tour" turned into a news
conference because supporters were outnumbered by protesters."

http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DNGUL6wq8hAu-cFGR_-DB4A

Teaser on last night's evening news: Todd Akin "draws more protests
than support in Mid-Missouri"

New Hampshire Puts Legislators Records Online

With research support from SEIU and the NEA, Granite State Progress
has created an interactive tool for voters to check the records of
their legislators. Organized by major issue, this is the first local
database of this type and size made available in the state and just
one of a handful of tools our entity is providing for partners working
on their state races.

Visit www.GraniteStateProgress.org to find out.
http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3D1sUUfJWY2fKOuqpm9LxIaA

Last week, working in tandem with hundreds of other groups, our state
entities sent hundreds of thousands of emails reminding people to make
sure they (and their=A0friends) were registered to vote on national
voter registration day.
