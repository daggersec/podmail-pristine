Thanks Tony.

The date is 2010, and she begins that remark by saying they aren't done the
full analysis.


*SECRETARY CLINTON:* Well, there hasn't been a final decision made. It is --

*QUESTION:* Are you willing to reconsider it?

*SECRETARY CLINTON:* Probably not. (Laughter.) And we -- but we haven't
finish all of the analysis. So as I say, we've not yet signed off on it.
But we are inclined to do so and we are for several reasons -- going back
to one of your original questions -- we're either going to be dependent on
dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada. And until we can get our
act together as a country and figure out that clean, renewable energy is in
both our economic interests and the interests of our planet -- (applause)
-- I mean, I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone how deeply
disappointed the President and I are about our inability to get the kind of
legislation through the Senate that the United States was seeking.
