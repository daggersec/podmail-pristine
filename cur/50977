Dear John --

Barack recorded a special video invitation for you to join him at the =
Democratic National Convention in Denver.

Watch it now and make a donation of $5 or more before midnight this =
Thursday, July 31st, and you could go backstage with Barack:

https://donate.barackobama.com/backstage17

Exactly one month from today, on the last night of the Democratic National =
Convention, more than 75,000 people will come together in the largest =
stadium in Denver to be part of history.

Barack is opening up the convention and his acceptance speech to as many =
people as possible.  Supporters like you are responsible for building this =
movement and for bringing this campaign so far -- and Barack wants you to =
be part of this important moment.

Free tickets will be available soon, but if you make a donation in any =
amount this month, you could be one of 10 supporters selected to meet =
Barack backstage before he delivers his speech.

If you make a donation by midnight this Thursday, July 31st, you and a =
guest could be flown to Denver, spend a couple of nights in a hotel, =
participate in the convention, and then go backstage with Barack before =
the big event.

Watch this short video and make a donation of $5 or more today to be part =
of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity:

https://donate.barackobama.com/backstage17

The Democratic National Convention is going to be an exciting and =
important event for this movement and for our country.  I hope you will be =
there to join us.

Thanks,

David

David Plouffe
Campaign Manager
