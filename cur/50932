Dear Family and Friends,

Ira came out of surgery at at noon today after successful aortic valve repl=
acement surgery.  He came out with such strong vitals, that the doctors did=
 not need to put him on any additional medications (blood pressure meds, or=
 others).  He woke up and concentrated his on demonstrating that he could b=
reathe without the respirator=97he came off the breathing tube in a record =
2.5 hours after surgery!
He is now resting reasonably comfortably in ICU, with attentive nurses, res=
piration therapists, and doctors all around.

Ira and I arrived at Johns Hopkins this morning at 5 a.m, and Susanna arriv=
ed at 8 a.m.  Brian will be here shortly.
We're all together, thankful that he came through this "experience" with hi=
s characteristic tenacity and humor.
Ira and I are so grateful to all of you for your prayers and good wishes.

I'll keep you all posted.

Love
Nancy
