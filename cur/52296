Hi John and Bruce (fyi Cheryl) - hope 2012 is off to a good start for you
both. This morning I remembered that Roy Spence offered in the autumn to do
branding work for the Foundation and CGI to help us tell a more coherent,
compelling and unified story of the collective work (which I think we could
use, though we should formally ask and answer this Q at the Board level). I
had lunch with Roy and Doug around CGI. At the least, I wanted to put Roy's
offer on both of your radar screens.  I would think it makes the most sense
to do this work after my mom determines what she wants to do but I wanted
to pass along to you both in case there was a compelling case in your minds
to do so earlier.
Thanks,
Chelsea
