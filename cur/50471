John --

Just checking in again about where you might want me to go next week if 
all goes well.  Mark Patterson is still hoping I can work with him on 
the nominations-clearing front if you don't have some other plan for 
me.  I think he's talking to Michael Froman about it again today.  I'm 
happy to work with Patterson -- just want to clear it with you and 
ensure you don't need me elsewhere.  Thanks.

Laura
