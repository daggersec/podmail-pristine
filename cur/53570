Jerome Corsi, 'Obama Nation' Author, Set To Appear On White Supremacist Rad=
io Show

So, on last night's Larry King Live, one of the things that Paul Waldman br=
ought up as a way of demonstrating Obama Nation author Jerome Corsi's lack =
of credibility was his past embrace of bigotry and general scumbaggery, as =
documented by "a whole series of bigoted and hateful posts" that Corsi "put=
 up on right-wing Web sites." None of which Corsi denied! But, Corsi defend=
ed himself by shooting back that Waldman had failed to mention "all my apol=
ogies for those statements."

Well, like just about everything else that dribbles out of Corsi's cakehole=
, you can take those apologies and discount them entirely, because this Sun=
day, he is set to make an appearance on the well-named "The Political Cessp=
ool" - which, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, is "an overtly =
racist, anti-Semitic radio show hosted by self-avowed white nationalist Jam=
es Edwards." In the past, the show has welcomed some marquee names in the h=
ate movement, including "Christian Identity pastor Pete Peters, Holocaust d=
enier Mark Weber and former Klan boss David Duke."

If you can bear a look at some of the show's Great Works, you can do so her=
e. This is how they roll in the Breakaway Republic of Swiftboatistan, all w=
ith the clucking approval of mainstream political media darling Mary Matali=
n, who regards these excrementalist dolts as "great scholars."

UPDATE: Sam Stein reports that he has received an email from Winston Smith,=
 confirming Corsi's appearance on the show. Smith's email reads as follows:=
 "Dr. Corsi's first appearance on our broadcast was very well received. On =
Sunday's show he'll be talking about his new book about Barak [sic] Hussein=
 Obama. It'll be a fascinating converstaion [sic], and we hope you'll liste=
n in."
