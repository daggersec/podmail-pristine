Friend,

Gloria Steinem is an icon, and one of my personal heroes -- I wanted to=
 make sure you saw what she had to say about Governor Quinn and this el=

From: Gloria Steinem
Subject: Why I=E2=80=99m standing with Governor Quinn

Friend,

I=E2=80=99m a Midwesterner, and I believe that the Midwest leads the na=
tion=2E That's why I'm doing everything I can to help Governor Quinn wi=
n this race=2E

Anti-equality forces haven=E2=80=99t been able to get everything they w=
ant in Washington, so the fight against women=E2=80=99s economic and re=
productive rights has shifted to the states=2E

At a time when women=E2=80=99s rights are still so clearly under attack=
, we need more leaders who aren=E2=80=99t afraid to do what=E2=80=99s r=
ight=2E It=E2=80=99s doubly important that you and I support state cham=
pions like Governor Quinn=2E

Will you join me by donating $5 or more before Tuesday=E2=80=99s big de=
adline?

https://quinnforillinois=2Ecom/champion

Governor Quinn strengthened the Illinois Equal Pay Act to make it one o=
f the strongest in the nation=2E He successfully fought for a law to en=
d discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace=2E

He implemented the Affordable Care Act to give more women access to qua=
lity health care, and he fought to protect funding for Planned Parentho=
od=2E

Governor Quinn is 100% pro-choice -- and he signed the birth control ba=
llot referendum to fight back against the Supreme Court's very anti-wom=
an decision in the Hobby Lobby case=2E

Now, he=E2=80=99s helping lead the charge to raise the minimum wage in =
Illinois -- which would have a huge impact on working women throughout =
Illinois, and be the best economic stimulus any state could have=2E

The list goes on and on, but this is the crucial message:

Governor Quinn is the kind of pro-equality leader this country needs=2E

Help keep one of our few true state champions for women in office=2E Do=
nate to Governor Quinn's campaign right now:

hibits certain businesses and their affiliates that have contracts, bid=
s, and proposals with state agencies from making political contribution=
s to state office holders responsible for awarding the contract=2E For =
