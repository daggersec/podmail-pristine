WJC's plan is interesting though - he is saying have her lean into ACA but
explain it is not going to be the same old Obama ACA and first order of
business is going to be repealing the Cadillac Tax. We have NOT leaned into
our repeal of the Cadillac Tax b/c we were afraid of the health economists.
I like leaning into it in a bigger way.  Agree the Randi-Mary Kay op-ed is
good, but I think a forceful argument that she is the only one who has the
strategic ability and guts to really make the fixes we need is good.

JAKE - What do you think?

NIKKI - You think this would work?
