John,
=20
When John Boehner announces he's coming to western New York for a fundraisi=
ng breakfast this weekend, we need to take notice.
=20
Boehner has made Tea Party extremist Chris Collins' race against Rep. Kathy=
 Hochul a top priority. Now he's taking a page out of Karl Rove's playbook =
and opening a so-called GOP "Victory Center" to turn out their right-wing b=
ase.=20
=20
This is serious. Polls show this race absolutely deadlocked =E2=80=93 and f=
ar-right groups have bought more than $775,000 in TV airtime to attack Kath=
y. If we want to take back the House, we must make sure Kathy wins.
=20
I've set a goal of raising $30,000 this week to help give Kathy the resourc=
es to win her tough new district. Are you with me?
=20
Click here to donate directly to Kathy=20

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/khochul

=E2=80=93 with less than a month before Election Day, she'll be counting on=
 us to help her fight Tea Party attacks and turn out her voters.

=20
This is a DCCC Frontline race for a reason. Kathy has proven she's not afra=
id to stand up to Boehner and Paul Ryan and fight for middle-class families=
, while multimillionaire Collins says the draconian Ryan budget didn't go f=
ar enough.
=20
I can't lose a spirited partner like Kathy. So I'm doing everything I can t=
o make sure she beats the Tea Party and returns to the House to fight for a=
ll of us. I hope you'll join me =E2=80=93 and donate to Kathy Hochul today.

Sincerely,

Kirsten Gillibrand
