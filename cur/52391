ACTION SPEAK



OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE
We Can't Let This Happen

Women's privacy, dignity and ability to make deeply personal health decisions will be at stake when the U.S. Supreme Court rules in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. Oral arguments in the case have been scheduled for early March, and it promises to be one of the most important cases for women's health since Roe v. Wade. That's because an adverse ruling in this case would shutter nearly all of the abortion clinics in Texas. Many states would soon follow suit, and women in even larger swaths of the country would lose access to abortion care.

Help us fight back: Donate $5 or more right now to our Women's Defense Fund and support the National Partnership's work to protect women's rights:
http://go.nationalpartnership.org/site/R?i=3DKE6nRmI19xFSlDi_5z2uYA

Related:

Last week, Roe v. Wade turned 43, and we published a special #ReclaimRoe edition of Repro Health Watch. We examined =
the state of women's health and rights, and the many challenges we face as we head into 2016.

Earlier this month, the National Partnership filed an amicus brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down Texas' onerous abortion restrictions in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. The brief makes a powerful case that the abortion restrictions Texas adopted contrast starkly with broad-based, bipartisan national efforts to increase patient access to care, improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs.

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT
Thanks, President Obama!

We applauded President Obama this month for vetoing the outrageous reconciliation bill, which would have caused real harm to women's health. Passing this legislation was a callous attempt
by anti-choice, an=
ti-women members of Congress to gut the Affordable Care Act (ACA) -- the greatest advance for women's health in a generation -- and stop women from accessing the high-quality, essential health care that Planned Parenthood provides.

to HealthCare.gov to enroll. http://go.nationalpartnership.org/site/R?i=3DhDZxhcus0qxooYp2mRkDUw


CHILDBIRTH CONNECTION
Insurance Coverage of Doula Care

Choices in Childbirth and Childbirth Connection, a program of the National Partnership, recently released a brief that makes a powerful case for the health benefits of doula care for women and babies. The report shows that significant cost reductions would result if more women used doulas and more insurers covered this care -- and
it identifies numerous pathways for expanding Medicaid and private insurance reimbursement of doula care.

PAID LEAVE
Coming Soon: Day of Action

Only 13 percent of workers have employer-provided paid family leave and fewer than 40 percent have employer-provided paid medical leave through a temporary disability insurance program. But Congress has yet to act.

That's why the National Partnership has joined with 1,000 Days to urge Congress to support the Family And Medical Insurance Leave (FAMILY) Act -- common sense legislation that would establish a national paid family and medical leave program that covers virtually everyone, no matter where they live or work.

We're collecting as many petition signatures as possible -- and we'll personally deliver them on your behalf as part of an upcom=
ing national day of action.

Please urge Congress to support paid leave by passing the FAMILY Act:

HEALTH IT
Where's Your Health Data?

Do you have online access to your health records? You have a legal right to your medical records in an electronic format, but some
doctors' offices don't know how to handle these requests. And too often, patients encounter outrageous hurdles like high fees or being unable to get their records in a user-f=
riendly format.
That's why we're leading the GetMyHealthData campaign -- to make it easier for patients and families to compile and use their own health records.

STATE OF THE UNION
Pushing For Progress

In his final State of the U=
nion address, President Obama laid out a clear-eyed and compelling vision for the nation and an agenda that is exactly what the country needs: "I'll keep pushing for
progress on ... equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hardworking families." The president was right, but he can't do it alone. To start, Congress needs to get with the (paid leave) program.

Women=E2=80=99s privacy, dignity and ability to make deeply personal health decisions will be at stake when the U.S. Supreme Court rules in <em>Whole Woman=E2=80=99s Health v. Hellerstedt</em>. Oral arguments in the case have been scheduled for early March, and it promises to be one of the most important cases for women=E2=80=99s health since <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. That=E2=80=99s because an adverse ruling in this case would shutter nearly all of=
 the abortion clinics in Texas. Many states would soon follow suit, and women in even larger swaths of the country would lose access to abortion care. <br /><br />

Earlier this month, the National Partnership filed an amicus brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down Texas=E2=80=99 onerous abortion restrictions in <em>Whole Woman=E2=80=99s Health v.

The brief makes a powerful case that the abortion restrictions Texas adopted contrast starkly with broad-based, bipartisan national efforts to increase patient access to care, improve health outcomes and reduce health care costs.<br />
