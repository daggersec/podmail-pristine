Dear Friend,

The House's plan to sue the President is only the latest example of what's =
wrong with Washington. Rather than doing the hard work of legislating, =
extremists in the House have decided to waste taxpayer time and money on a =
lawsuit that's destined to go nowhere.=20

If you agree that the House's proposed lawsuit is a needless distraction =
and a waste of taxpayer resources, we hope you'll join us and sign this =
petition.

http://go.bennetforcolorado.com/e140819

In the Senate, we've taken some tough votes to move our country forward. =
More than a year ago, we passed a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration =
reform bill -- yet the House never even brought it up for a vote.

Instead, the House chose to spend its time doing next-to-nothing and then =
suing the President. Thanks to extremists, this Congress is on pace to be =
among the least productive in American history -- they can't pass bills =
that matter, but they have no problem choosing to sue the President.

This political gamesmanship needs to stop. This lawsuit is nothing more =
than an election-year stunt, and we're speaking out -- add your name to =
ours.

http://go.bennetforcolorado.com/e140819

Thank you for joining us and telling the House to get back to work.

Sincerely,

Michael
