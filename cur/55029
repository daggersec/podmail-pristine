Elias =E2=80=93 we would like to do a call with you to discuss the letter p=
asted
below that we are considering sending to the Daily Mail.

Varun =E2=80=93 can you set up a call with Marc sometime tomorrow or Wednes=
day?

Thanks, Jen



I am writing to make you aware of some concerning incidents we have
experienced with your reporter David Maratosko.

On two separate occasions during trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, David
attempted to trail the motorcade between event stops, getting dangerously
close to the point where the state police escorting the motorcade had to
pull him over on more than one occasion.

He also made a false report about the speed of the motorcade, claiming that
it was traveling at speeds higher than it was, and posted video that
indicated he was speeding in pursuit of the vehicles, which the Iowa
Department of Transportation and others refuted and cited concerns about.

We strive to run an open campaign that facilitates journalists=E2=80=99 abi=
lity to
cover us in a safe and professional environment.  At times David has
conducted himself perfectly professionally at our events.  At times he has
been disruptive =E2=80=93 shouting over and disrupting other reporters to t=
he point
that other journalists have complained to the campaign.  We expect that
kind of exchange during the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign.
But we find the motorcade incidents disturbing and wanted to bring them to
your attention.

Sincerely,



Jennifer Palmieri

Communications Director, Hillary for America
