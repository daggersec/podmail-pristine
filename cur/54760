Subject: Idea For Hillary And Women's Health
To: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>, jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com

Noticed you guys pivoting off of Trump on women to hit Rubio/Walker on
abortion and also leaning into the Planned Parenthood stuff a bit.

My idea is for Hillary to do an interview with ThinkProgress, just on
women's health issues. Could do over the phone and just would take a few
minutes. We could then run it as a Q+A. I think I'd have Tara Culp-Ressler,
an amazingly talented young writer who has been covering these issues
exclusively, ask the questions. She could really get into how extreme these
candidates are and also her extensive history working on these issues.

I really think that something like this could take off online. The one
thing Bernie has going right now is a lot of online excitement. But this is
one of the issues that people online are into more than anything else and
Hillary I think has a much more compelling story to tell.

Let me know what you guys think. Obviously, I know any request like this is
a long shot but I think there is some strategic sense for you guys at the
moment so I thought I'd ask.
