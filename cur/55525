Dear John,

This isn't just another deadline. We're less than 15 hours away from our filing period.

You know what is at stake. This campaign is only successful if we hit our goals each quarter, and your contribution today will ensure that we hit our number again.

I just talked to Ross and we have just over $6,700 left to raise. You can give online at www.kirstengillibrand.com/deadline [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/1097/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=11699 ] or call the office at 212-481-2010.

Any amount helps from $50 to the $5,000 individual max.

Thank you for all that you do.

Warmly,

Kirsten
