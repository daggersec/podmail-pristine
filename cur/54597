Subject: Murphy raiser is on Wednesday!

Amb. Murphy accidentally wrote "tomorrow" in his email to you, so Sara and
I wanted to flag it for you that it's definitely Wednesday evening, not
tomorrow!

Tammy corrected him in her next email, but just flagging so you don't
worry.

Your flight Thursday morning is at 8:00 am, so it might be better to get
back to NYC that night, instead of staying in Red Bank.

You can take a train out there, I can drive you, or the finance staff going
out there from Lisa's team can drive you.
