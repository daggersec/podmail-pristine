Exactly.  This is a pick out of the Clarence Thomas, Harriet Miers mold -
putting PR above substance, seriousness, and ability.  That's not putting
country first, that's putting political public relations first.

doesn't this raise concerns about who he'd pick for the Supreme Court? Who
would lead FEMA? etc

This is a branding moment that shows how McCain's judgment is like Bush's:
terrible. Time to pile on.

	From NBC's Mark Murray and NBC/NJ's Adam Aigner-Treworgy
	The McCain camp has just released a tick-tock of how the Palin pick
came to be. And according to it, McCain had met her just one time prior to
yesterday.

	The tick-tock from McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker:
	"John McCain first met Governor Sarah Palin at the National
Governors Association meeting in Washington in February of 2008 and came
away extraordinarily impressed. John McCain followed her career and admired
her tenacity and her many accomplishments. She was scheduled for a high
profile speaking role at our convention and included in the VP selection
process because of his admiration for her strong reform credentials. Last
Sunday, Governor Palin and John McCain had a conversation over the phone.
Governor Palin was at the Alaska State Fair, and John McCain was at his home
at Phoenix. Previously, Rick Davis, John McCain's campaign manager, had also
been in regular contact with the Governor as part of the on-going selection
process. This past week, Governor Palin arrived with Kris Perry in
Flagstaff, Arizona, on Wednesday evening. Upon arrival, Governor Palin and
her longtime aide Kris Perry met with Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter of the
McCain campaign at Mr. Bob Delgado's home in Flagstaff. Mr. Delgado is the
CEO of the Hensley corporation, which is Mrs. Cindy McCain's family
business. On Thursday morning, Governor Palin and staff were joined by Mrs.
Cindy McCain and later joined by John McCain at the McCain family home in
Sedona, Arizona. At approximately 11:00 a.m. Thursday August 28, 2008, John
McCain formally invited Governor Sarah Palin to join the Republican ticket
as the vice presidential nominee on the deck of the McCain family home." 

	"Later that morning, John McCain departed for Phoenix and Governor
Palin departed with staff to Flagstaff, Arizona.  Governor Palin, Kris
Perry, Steve Schmidt and Mark Salter proceeded to the Manchester Inn and
Conference Center in Middleton, Ohio. They were checked into the hotel as
the Upton Family. While there, Governor Palin's children, who had been told
they were going to Ohio to celebrate their parents' wedding anniversary,
were told for the first time that their mother would be a nominee for Vice
President of the United States of America."     

	"Today, John McCain was proud to announce that Alaska Governor Sarah
Palin, a proven-reformer, will share a partnership with him to shake things
up in Washington and to make government more effective for American
families."
