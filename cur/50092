Natural Security: Oklahoma is Not OK
In 2008, there were two earthquakes in Oklahoma registering 3.0 or greater =
magnitude on the Richter scale. So far, in 2015, there have been about 700,=
 and the U.S. Geological Survey is projecting a total of 941<http://earthqu=
ake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/oklahoma/images/OklahomaEQsBarGraph.png> fo=
r the year. According to state agencies<http://earthquakes.ok.gov/what-we-k=
now/>, that's around 600 times the historical average.
Oklahomans tend to make the case, however, that what shakes in Oklahoma, st=
ays in Oklahoma. These are relatively minor quakes, after all, and even nei=
ghboring states are unlikely to feel any effects.
But there's one place in Oklahoma where a serious earthquake could make the=
 rest of the country tremble, too: the city of Cushing. In an October 8th m=
eeting with a group of visiting journalists<http://www.sej.org/initiatives/=
sej-annual-conferences/AC2015-agenda-thursday>, Oklahoma's Secretary for En=
ergy and Environment, Michael Teague, mentioned that there had been a "stor=
m of earthquakes in Cushing" in recent weeks. Just two days later, a 4.5 ma=
gnitude<http://www.koco.com/news/45magnitude-earthquake-recorded-near-cushi=
ng/35770656> earthquake hit the town.
Cushing, Oklahoma, bills itself as "the pipeline crossroads of the world," =
and it is, indeed, one of the global industry's important crude oil hubs<ht=
tp://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/05/cushing-oklahoma-small-town-is-holding-illions=
-in-black-gold.html>. The network of underground pipes and above ground sto=
rage tanks in Cushing is a point of convergence for much North American oil=
 on its journey from wellhead to refinery to consumer. The benchmark price =
for U.S. crude, called West Texas Intermediate, is even set there.
In September, Cushing briefly lost power<http://www.tulsaworld.com/earthqua=
kes/another-quake-near-cushing-knocks-out-power-state-regulators-add/articl=
e_c0bcbb84-c903-5073-8673-bafc10afead7.html> after a 4.0 temblor and a hist=
oric building<http://kfor.com/2015/09/30/building-partially-collapses-in-cu=
shing/> later collapsed. Any serious damage to the oil infrastructure in th=
e area, which has not been reported at this time, could have a significant =
effect on U.S. oil prices and supplies, as the New York Times just reported=
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/us/new-concern-over-quakes-in-oklahoma-n=
ear-a-hub-of-us-oil.html?_r=3D0>. This is somewhat ironic, of course, given=
 that the oil and gas industry is causing the quakes in the first place, un=
like the tornadoes and terrorists the local community has prepared<http://w=
ww.eenews.net/stories/1059981838> for.
The majority of Oklahoma's earthquakes are called "triggered seismic activi=
ty," or in other words, they are manmade. The meteoric rise of hydraulic fr=
acturing, or fracking, is the proximate cause. Fracking, of course, has als=
o radically changed the U.S. energy security picture in recent years, sendi=
ng the nation's oil import dependence tumbling from a high of 60 percent in=
 2005 to 27 percent today. This has lessened U.S. dependence on unfriendly =
regimes, alleviated the trade imbalance, and helped bring down high prices =
globally, which has had the secondary benefit of making some hostile countr=
ies (i.e., Iran) more amenable to negotiations.
Fracking has its drawbacks, however. In the case of earthquakes, the culpri=
t is specifically the disposal of water<http://earthquakes.ok.gov/wp-conten=
t/uploads/2015/04/OGS_Summary_Statement_2015_04_20.pdf> associated with the=
se oil and gas drilling operations. Although fracking uses significant amou=
nts of water and that can be a problem<http://www.ceres.org/issues/water/sh=
ale-energy/shale-and-water-maps/hydraulic-fracturing-water-stress-water-dem=
and-by-the-numbers> in its own right, it's the water found in the well alon=
gside the oil and gas that's the big disposal challenge. Generally, this as=
sociated or "produced" brackish water is reinjected<http://earthquakes.ok.g=
ov/what-we-know/seismicity-an-overview/> deep underground. According to Okl=
ahoma's Teague, there are some 4,200 such wells around the state, and not a=
ll of them are causing earthquakes.
Nonetheless, the growing earthquake risk has raised calls to shut down the =
injection wells, but the state has a serious dilemma on its hands in consid=
ering a moratorium. An estimated 2/3 of all the jobs in Oklahoma depend on =
the oil and gas sector, so a halt in drilling would be devastating for most=
 people living in the state.
Cushing, however, is a special case, which the state's regulators acknowled=
ged by moving quickly in September to shut down or curtail five wells<http:=
//occeweb.com/News/09-18-15CUSHING.pdf> in the Cushing area. Even with that=
 action, the latest quake on October 9th was the biggest yet.
There is still uncertainty as to how or why the disposal wells are causing =
the quakes (and it's not just Oklahoma; the USGS is tracking increased seis=
micity<http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2015/1070/> in eight states with fracking op=
erations), but in the near term, it may well be a matter of national energy=
 security that the state do more to stop the shaking in Cushing. Because ev=
en though Americans have gotten used to the idea that we're awash in oil, t=
he truth is that the United States remains part of a global market. And the=
 global oil market in turn remains one disaster away from its next price sp=
ike, whether it's political instability in Saudi Arabia or a natural disast=
er in Cushing.
In the long term, the earthquakes send a compelling warning signal that the=
 industry may have to find another way to deal with water if hydraulic frac=
turing technology is going to remain viable.
Sharon E. Burke, a senior advisor at New America, served as the assistant s=
ecretary of defense for operational energy from 2010 to 2014.

important crude oil hubs</a>. The network of underground pipes and above gr=

oklahoma-near-a-hub-of-us-oil.html?_r=3D0">
just reported</a>. This is somewhat ironic, of course, given that the oil a=
nd gas industry is causing the quakes in the first place, unlike the tornad=
oes and terrorists the local community has
<a href=3D"http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059981838">prepared</a> for.<o:p>=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-a=
lt:auto">The majority of Oklahoma&#8217;s earthquakes are called &#8220;tri=
ggered seismic activity,&#8221; or in other words, they are manmade. The me=
teoric rise of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is the
 proximate cause. Fracking, of course, has also radically changed the U.S. =
energy security picture in recent years, sending the nation&#8217;s oil imp=
ort dependence tumbling from a high of 60 percent in 2005 to 27 percent tod=
ay. This has lessened U.S. dependence
 on unfriendly regimes, alleviated the trade imbalance, and helped bring do=
wn high prices globally, which has had the secondary benefit of making some=
 hostile countries (i.e., Iran) more amenable to negotiations.<o:p></o:p></=
p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-a=
lt:auto">Fracking has its drawbacks, however. In the case of earthquakes, t=
he culprit is specifically the
<a href=3D"http://earthquakes.ok.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/OGS_Summary=
_Statement_2015_04_20.pdf">
disposal of water</a> associated with these oil and gas drilling operations=
. Although fracking uses significant amounts of water and
<a href=3D"http://www.ceres.org/issues/water/shale-energy/shale-and-water-m=
aps/hydraulic-fracturing-water-stress-water-demand-by-the-numbers">
that can be a problem</a> in its own right, it&#8217;s the water found in t=
he well alongside the oil and gas that&#8217;s the big disposal challenge. =
Generally, this associated or &#8220;produced&#8221; brackish water is
<a href=3D"http://earthquakes.ok.gov/what-we-know/seismicity-an-overview/">=
reinjected</a> deep underground. According to Oklahoma&#8217;s Teague, ther=
e are some 4,200 such wells around the state, and not all of them are causi=
ng earthquakes.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-a=
lt:auto">Nonetheless, the growing earthquake risk has raised calls to shut =
down the injection wells, but the state has a serious dilemma on its hands =
in considering a moratorium. An estimated
 2/3 of all the jobs in Oklahoma depend on the oil and gas sector, so a hal=
t in drilling would be devastating for most people living in the state.<o:p=
></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-a=
lt:auto">Cushing, however, is a special case, which the state&#8217;s regul=
ators acknowledged by moving quickly in September to
<a href=3D"http://occeweb.com/News/09-18-15CUSHING.pdf">shut down or curtai=
l five wells</a> in the Cushing area. Even with that action, the latest qua=
ke on October 9th was the biggest yet.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-a=
lt:auto">There is still uncertainty as to how or why the disposal wells are=
 causing the quakes (and it&#8217;s not just Oklahoma; the USGS is
<a href=3D"http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2015/1070/">tracking increased seismicit=
y</a> in eight states with fracking operations), but in the near term, it m=
ay well be a matter of national energy security that the state do more to s=
top the shaking in Cushing. Because
 even though Americans have gotten used to the idea that we&#8217;re awash =
in oil, the truth is that the United States remains part of a global market=
. And the global oil market in turn remains one disaster away from its next=
 price spike, whether it&#8217;s political instability
 in Saudi Arabia or a natural disaster in Cushing.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-a=
lt:auto">In the long term, the earthquakes send a compelling warning signal=
 that the industry may have to find another way to deal with water if hydra=
ulic fracturing technology is going
 to remain viable. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>
