Nick, Sara:

I spoke to Gov Rendell.  He is of course happy to host and help pull everyt=
hing together.  We're checking the constitution center for a venue although=
 the Gov wasnt positive they have a room of the right size -- they have sma=
ll and very big but in-between may be tough.  he's mulling over other possi=
ble locations and will call me in the morning if he has an inspiration.

He is going to call Gov. Douglas (who is the NGA's Republican co-chair this=
 year) to enlist his support and help in getting Rs to come.  He thought th=
e notional schedule -- mon nite with the Ds, tues AM with everyone, done in=
 time to get folks back to DC for DGA -- sounded right.  He also said not t=
o worry about the money -- we will figure that out.

I will reach out to Ray Sheppach this weekend to get his wheels turning.  I=
'm not going to be in town on monday but can join by phone.

Roy
