Dear Members of the Georgetown Community:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It is with great pleasure that I announce Chris Murphy (L&rsquo;98) as Georgetown&rsquo;s new Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement. &nbsp;An accomplished leader with extensive experience in national and local government and in the private sector, he will bring exceptional perspective to Georgetown as we work to strengthen our engagements across the Washington community. &nbsp;<a href="http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=2&ms=MjMyMTk0ODcS1&r=NzI1MzAzODY0NzES1&b=0&j=NjIwNjY2MDgxS0&mt=1&rt=0" name="Hyperlink_20150806_152815338" target="_blank" >I invite you to read more about him here</a>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Mr. Murphy returns to our community following a distinguished career of public service.&nbsp; Most recently, he served for four years as Chief of Staff to Washington, DC&rsquo;s Mayor Vincent C. Gray, where he managed the Mayor&rsquo;s Executive Office and furthered his major education, economic, and community initiatives.&nbsp; Prior to that, Mr. Murphy served in the Administration of President Barack Obama as Deputy Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and at Atlantic Media Company as General Counsel and Executive Director of Human Resources.&nbsp; For eight years, he served as Executive Director of City Year Washington DC, a local chapter of the Americorps national service program, after serving as a Founding Corps Member of the original City Year in Boston.&nbsp; He received his BA from Harvard University and his JD from Georgetown University Law Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We are in a period of intensive engagement both nationally and locally on a complex set of issues, including access and affordability, regulation of higher education, and master planning. &nbsp;In these areas and more, Mr. Murphy will help to strengthen our relationships with governmental and community leaders, enhance our civic engagement throughout the Washington area, and more actively support policy and partnerships that advance our University&rsquo;s mission and vision.&nbsp; We are deeply grateful to the members of our Offices of Federal Relations and Community Engagement for their committed work in building the strong foundation that makes this expanded engagement possible.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We look forward to welcoming Mr. Murphy back to Georgetown on&nbsp;August 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;We encourage you to be in touch with him at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Christopher.Murphy@georgetown.edu" name="Hyperlink_20150806_152600968" target="_blank" >Christopher.Murphy@georgetown.edu</a>&nbsp;to engage him in your work.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please join me in warmly congratulating Mr. Murphy on his new role.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sincerely,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
John J. DeGioia<br />
