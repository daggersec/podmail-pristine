John:

You now enter the hallowed ranks of the John Quincy Adams Club, which only
admits to membership those individuals who return to federal service in a
less exalted office than they held before, because of their desire to serve
the country.  Actually I just made up that club, because your agreement to
come back as counselor reminded me of the following story:

"In 1829 Adams retired to private life in the town of Quincy; but only for
a brief period, for in 1830, largely by Anti-Masonic votes, he was elected
a member of the national House of Representatives. On its being suggested
to him that his acceptance of this position would degrade an ex-president,
Adams replied that no person could be degraded by serving the people as a
representative in congress or, he added, as a selectman of his town. His
service in congress from 1831 until his death is, in some respects, the
most noteworthy part of his career."

So congratulations on your new appointment, and thank you for agreeing to
serve.  This is great news for the President and the country.  As the
President said last week, 2014 will be a year of action, and with your
understanding of both energy and Washington I think we can get a great deal
done to put important elements of the President's Climate Action Plan into
effect.  You know you can count on Ernie and me to do whatever we can to
 advance the ball.

All best,

Dan
