>>> Hi John. Hope all is well. I'm sorry to bother you BC I know how busy yo=
u are. I wanted to ask if you would be willing to be a reference for a UN jo=
b I'm applying for, head of the UN Global Compact. The deadline for the app i=
s tomorrow and it took me awhile to track down current contact info for you s=
o apologize for weekend bother and short turnaround time. I have decided to l=
eave the foundation to explore other opportunities preferably in development=
 on a wider scope. I have BC full support and he's offered his help so I'm l=
ooking at the UN, this job in particular, as well as others. Given my work w=
ith you at the White House and at cf I was hoping you would be willing to he=
lp and be a reference. Again sorry for the bother. Thanks for your considera=
tion. Best Laura=20
