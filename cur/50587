Had a good meeting with him. Compared notes on the 1968 McCarthy campaign.
He and  Amy will host a high $ fundraiser at their place if we want. Pushed
him on HVF as our top ask, but also made the case for Priorities. They are
doing a lot for the Senate and planned parenthood. They have also made a
pledge to Brock, but I think Media Matters, not CTR.
