I just talked with Stephanie.  I told here there was a small group doing
some initial planning and we would like to be briefed on the research to
inform what we're doing.
She (very understandably) asked if this was a legitimate group--in contrast
to the other 17 people who have called her recently and said they were "the
real" HRC messenger.  I said I was glad she asked and she is more than
welcome to confirm with John or Cheryl that this is a legit need.
I also requested that only she and Garin be involved in any interaction
with us.
She is going to follow up with me about a time for a briefing.
