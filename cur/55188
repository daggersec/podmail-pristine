Dear VoteVets.org Supporter,

On the 11th Day of the 11th Month each year, we honor all those
veterans who came before us. This year, as in recent years, we
also honor the newest generation of war veterans. Today is not a
day for partisan politics, it's a day for the nation to come
together as one to honor those who sacrificed for our nation, in
uniform.

This year, however, we also have a tremendous opportunity to
honor two of the greatest veterans this nation has ever seen.
With the incoming administration, comes the opportunity to send
incredible veterans back into government to serve this nation,
as they have time and time again.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN OUR PETITION FOR MAX CLELAND AND TAMMY
DUCKWORTH TO HAVE A ROLE IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

http://ga3.org/campaign/petition_cleland_duckworth

Max Cleland served our nation with honor in Vietnam, losing
three limbs on the battlefield. Max could have used that as an
excuse to live out the rest of his life quietly, but he did not.
Upon his return, he served Veterans in his home state of
Georgia, and then became the head of the Veterans Administration
(now the Department of Veterans Affairs). He served his home
state again, as a member of the U.S. Senate. Every step of the
way, Max never forgot the veterans who came before him, and
those who would be coming after him.

Tammy Duckworth served America in Iraq. Duckworth lost both of
her legs in 2004, when the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter she was
co-piloting was hit by a rocket propelled grenade fired by Iraqi
insurgents. Duckworth received a Purple Heart and was promoted
to Major at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where she was
presented with an Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal. Upon
her return home, she ran for Congress in 2006, and now serves as
the head of the veterans department in Illinois. Tammy has even
remained in the National Guard, showing that nothing will keep
her from serving her country!

Now is the time for President-Elect Obama to show the nation
that he recognizes it is important to bring America's great
veterans into his administration. One way he can do that is to
name Max Cleland and Tammy Duckworth to roles in his
administration.

CLICK HERE TO ASK THAT MAX CLELAND AND TAMMY DUCKWORTH BE GIVEN
A ROLE IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION

Please use today to honor the veterans in your area ? volunteer
your services to the local veterans center, connect with
veterans in the area and listen to them about the challenges
veterans face, and above all, thank them for their service. But,
also take a moment to show support for two particular veterans,
Max Cleland and Tammy Duckworth, and tell your friends and
family to join us in asking that they be asked back into
government at this crucial time for veterans in America.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Jon Soltz
