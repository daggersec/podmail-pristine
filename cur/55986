I just wanted to make sure that you all are in the loop about the staffing
situation and also our general push to make as much of our work available to
partners.  Here is a brief personnel update.

 

Update on Staff Transitions

Senior Staff

Friday the 13th was Christina Reynolds and Tom Mattzie's last day.  The
announcement of their departure went smoother than expected.  Malea Stenzel
- Operations Manager will be moving to part time consultant status.   She
will work on the PMUSA transition and stay on PMUSA payroll for the ongoing
close out which will take until next year.  We are working to determine the
extent of her role on in-house coordination of the respective organizations
HR functions.

Other Staff Transitions

Ryan Duncan (Tom's former assistant) interviewed for and was selected for a
media monitoring position (we had one media monitor staff departure last
week).  Ryan is now a full time tracker/monitor and his salary will be
brought to parity with the rest of the media monitors.  Greg Rosalsky a
tracker, has been offered a job with the Obama campaign as a tracker - he
will complete his last day with PMUSA will be June 25th.   To keep up the 3
cycle, 7 day a week media monitoring and McCain tracking across the country
requires 7 people.  ***I think we will need to look to replace Greg and I
would like to instruct the tracking director to start the search, this
doesn't change any budgets that you have seen - all budgets reflect this
number of staff.

 

Making our Work Available

 

In addition to our daily coordination, research and messaging work we are
pro-actively trying to expedite research documents and videos to the website
and youtube.  Following our last meeting together we are trying to be
pro-active about updating this research on the web.  While we wait to reach
a decision about box.net (our high resolution video storage).  We are
preparing to make the tracking footage stored on youtube (with transcripts)
public.  I vetted this with Skadden and they had no concerns about making
more of this tracking footage public (right  now we make youtube clips of
town halls public as necessary.)  I would like to start to systematically
put the bulk of our clips up at the end of the week.
