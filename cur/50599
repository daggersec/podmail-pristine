John - this isn't very complicated.

Illinois' 17th district is one of the most competitive House races in the =
ENTIRE country.

Don't believe us? Just see the email below from DCCC Chairman Steve Israel =
-- the man in charge of electing Democrats to the House.

If Cheri doesn't hit her grassroots goal in the next 48 hours, our =
opponents will pounce at the opportunity put this seat back in Tea Party =
hands. We can't let that happen.

As of 6PM, we're still 172 donations short of our goal. Please, step up =
now before it's too late:

48 HOURS TO GO: Please help Cheri have a strong grassroots showing by =
giving $5 or more before Monday's critical fundraising deadline >>
http://action.cheribustos.com/13sep28-1

------------ Original Email ------------

From: Steve Israel
Subject Line: Cheri is in a top race

As Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, it's my =
job to find the best candidates to run for Congress.

One of our top races is Cheri Bustos in Illinois' 17th district -- this =
seat is CRITICAL to winning a Democratic majority.

National Republicans know it too. That's why shady special interest groups =
will be targeting Cheri, ready to spend HUGE amounts of cash to buy this =
seat.

If we are going to win a Democratic majority against the right-wing =
establishment and all the cash that goes with it, Cheri needs to have a =
huge showing for Monday's big FEC fundraising deadline. Will you help her =
do it?

Please help Cheri have a strong grassroots showing by giving $5 or more =
before Monday's critical fundraising deadline >>
http://action.cheribustos.com/13sep28-1

Every dollar counts, so we need every one of you to step up and give =
whatever you can.

Please dig deep for Cheri:
