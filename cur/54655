Dear John:

Thanks for speaking with me today.

I am in the process of drafting a "2 pager" on my background,
qualifications, HHS agency knowledge, unique skills that I feel that I
posess, and other information.

I leave for Erie tomorrow morning a 7 am, and won't be back until Thursday
night, so I will plan to have something to you asap.

Like you, I would prefer to communicate with you via this private gmail
address or through the telephone numbers below.

Ted
