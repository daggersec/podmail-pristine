IF CONGRESSMAN CAN INTERCEDE REGARDING federal stimulus funds or other  
federal pressure to stop Governor Schwartnegger's disastrous, short sided,  
COSTLY proposed ruination of California's In Home Supportive Services,  
Congressman Waxman would stop the unraveling of a public policy that baby  boomers, 
seniors and people with disabilities would be enormously blessed  by.  By 
so doing  we could also save hundreds of thousands of jobs of  caregivers who 
would likely require public assistance while  saving  taxpayers OVER 4 
times the cost of nursing home  virtual incarceration in violation of IHSS 
consumer's rights under the Olmstead  Supreme Court decision, he would truly be 
doing Hashem's Work!
 
with warmth, prayer and  anticipation
