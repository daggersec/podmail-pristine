Why Lame Duck Budget Battle is Really a Struggle Between the 1% and Ordinar=
y Americans
=20
     To hear some pundits tell it, the Lame Duck budget battle is about the=
 =93unsustainable federal deficit,=94 or =93entitlement reform,=94 or even =
=93tax rates.=94  These characterizations make it sound like a contest betw=
een two competing sets of policies and programs.
=20
      But underlying all of the policy-speak, the Lame Duck budget battle i=
s really about one question.  Will the 1% of Americans who had the party th=
at caused the deficit be asked to pay the bill?
=20
       The pain of =93fixing=94 the deficit should not be distributed widel=
y.  It should be distributed fairly =96 to the people who caused the proble=
m and reaped the benefit =96 the wealthiest people in America.
=20
      The Lame Duck battle goes right to the most important question facing=
 our political and economic decision-makers at this moment in American hist=
ory: will we continue to allow the wealthiest 1% of Americans to siphon off=
 all of our economic growth for themselves, or will the benefits of that gr=
owth be widely spread to ordinary Americans?   What portion of the goods an=
d services produced by our society will go to the wealthiest 1% of American=
s =96 and how much goes to everyone else?
=20
     From what some right wing pundits and =93wise men=94 from the business=
 community say, you=92d think that America is poorer today than it was fift=
y years ago, when Medicare and Medicaid became part of our social contract =
=96 or 70 years ago when we created Social Security.  Some of the =93entitl=
ement programs=94 we=92ve had for decades are now =93unsustainable=94 they =
say. =20
=20
      We no longer can afford to guarantee seniors a decent retirement?  We=
 can=92t afford to guarantee every American the right to decent health care=
?  We can=92t afford to provide guaranteed pensions =96 or to provide a liv=
ing wage to our workers so they can look forward to providing a better stan=
dard of living for their kids? We just can=92t do big things anymore like b=
uild the Interstate Highway system, or send someone to the moon, or create =
the Internet? They claim that =93we=94 =96 meaning most of us but certainly=
 not the 1% -- have to get used to the new =93normal=94 of austerity and lo=
wered expectations.
=20
      To put it bluntly, that is simply ridiculous.
=20
      To understand what is really going on all you have to know is three c=
ritical facts:
=20
      1). First, for the last three decades our per-person gross domestic p=
roduct =96 the amount that the average person in America produces in goods =
and services -- has consistently increased.  That increase has been slowed =
by several economic downturns and by the Great Recession, but over time, we=
 have more to go around today than we did thirty years ago.
=20
      In fact, real (adjusted for inflation) per capita gross domestic prod=
uct (GDP) increased more than 80% over the period between 1975 and 2005.  I=
n the last ten years, before the Great Recession, it increased at an averag=
e rate of 1.8% per year.  That means that if the benefits of economic growt=
h were equally spread throughout our society, everyone should have been alm=
ost 20% better off (with compounding) in 2008 than they were in 1998.=20
=20
     2). But ordinary people weren=92t better off.  In fact, median family =
income actually dropped in the years before the recession.  It fell from $5=
2,301 (in 2009 dollars) in 2000 to $50,112 in 2008. And, of course it conti=
nued to drop as the recession set in. In fact, as a group, ordinary America=
ns haven=92t had a raise in about 30 years.=20
=20
     How is that possible?=20
=20
     Was it =96 as the Right likes to argue =96 because of the growth of th=
e Federal Government?  Nope. In fact, the percentage of GDP going to federa=
l spending actually dropped during the last four years of the Clinton Admin=
istration. When Bush took office it began to increase again as the Republic=
ans increased spending on wars.  Over the last 28 years, federal spending h=
as averaged about 20.9% of the GDP and varied within a range of only about =
5%, with the high being in 1983 (in the middle of the Reagan years) and the=
 low in 2000 before Bush took office.  It has never even come close to the =
43.6% of GDP that it consumed during World War II in 1943 and 1944, or the =
41.9% it consumed in 1945.   The percent of GDP that goes to Federal spendi=
ng went up in 2009 and 2010 =96 but that was mainly because the economy shr=
unk on the one hand, and a major, temporary stimulus bill was need on the o=
ther to prevent another Great Depression.
=20
    Was it because taxes have skyrocketed?  No again.  In fact, Bureau of E=
conomic Analysis data indicates that Americans now pay 23.6% of income for =
state, local and federal taxes compared to 27% from the 1970=92s through th=
e 1990=92s.  In fact, the overall tax burden is the lower today than it has=
 been since 1958.
=20
     Was it that labor became less productive?  No.  In fact, there has bee=
n a major gap between the increase in the productivity of our workforce and=
 the increase in their wages.  Even when wages were improving at the end of=
 the Clinton years, productivity went up 2.5% per year and median hourly wa=
ges went up only 1.5%.=20
=20
      From 2000 to 2004, worker productivity exploded by an annual rate of =
3.8% but hourly wages went up only 1% and median family income actually dro=
pped .9%.
=20
     The bottom line is that people who work for a living (most of us) are =
getting a smaller and smaller slice of the nation=92s economic pie.=20
=20
     In fact, wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of the nation=
=92s gross domestic product since the government started keeping records in=
 1947.  And corporate profits have climbed to their highest levels since th=
e 1960=92s.
=20
      Which brings us to fact number three.
=20
      3). Virtually all of the increase in our gross domestic product over =
the ten years before the Great Recession went to the wealthiest 2% of the p=
opulation.=20
=20
     These changes in income distribution are not the result of =93natural =
laws.=94  They were the result of systems set up by human beings that diffe=
rentially benefit different groups in the society.
=20
      And that is what the Lame Duck budget battle is all about.  The wealt=
hiest people in America want to continue to siphon off all of the growth in=
 productivity and economic production =96 it=92s that simple.
=20
      When George Bush took office from Bill Clinton we had a massive budge=
t surplus.  The reason was that Clinton had passed a tax bill that mainly i=
ncreased the tax rates paid by the wealthiest Americans.  Republicans made =
dire predictions that these new taxes on the wealthy would cause a recessio=
n.  Instead, the economy expanded like gangbusters.  Under Clinton the econ=
omy created 22 million new jobs.  The tech boom contributed mightily to inc=
reased productivity of the American work force.   And, notwithstanding the =
increase in taxes, the rich weren=92t hurting.  Many fortunes were made dur=
ing the 1990=92s.
=20
     But the wealthiest Americans and their representatives in the Republic=
an Party wanted more.  After the Supreme Court handed George Bush and the R=
epublicans the election victory in 2000, they insisted that tax rates for t=
he wealthy be slashed. And when the Republicans launched two wars they refu=
sed to increases taxes on the rich =96 or anyone else =96 to pay the bill.
=20
      Now they insist that cost of fixing the deficit they created, should =
fall upon the poor and the middle class and they should be asked to pay not=
hing.  Instead, they want Social Security recipients who make $15,000 per y=
ear to have their Medicare benefits cut.  Instead, they want to cut our spe=
nding on education and new roads and transit systems.  Instead they want to=
 cut food stamps and unemployment benefits that help prevent ordinary peopl=
e from falling into poverty when they are laid off by a company like Sensat=
a, that is making money manufacturing its products in the U.S. but wants to=
 make even more by shipping its jobs to China.
=20
      The increasing costs of the country=92s health care programs are not =
driven by greedy seniors, or by =93unsustainable entitlement programs.=94  =
They are driven by rising health care costs =96 that result in large measur=
e from the fact that our insurance company-driven health care system led us=
 to pay twice as much per capita for health care than any other society on =
earth =96 even though we are 37th in health care outcomes.
      You bet we have to control health care costs, but we don=92t do that =
by transferring those costs to ordinary people whose share of the economic =
pie has been stagnating for years.  We need to do that by creating a more r=
ational system for financing and delivering health care =96 a project that =
has finally begun with the passage of ObamaCare.
=20
      Changes to Medicare or Medicaid that actually control health care cos=
ts are a great idea.  We might start by allowing Medicare to negotiate with=
 drug companies to get lower rates on prescriptions =96 which was explicitl=
y prohibited under the law that created Republican-crafted Medicare Part D =
drug benefit.
=20
      But Democrats should not agree to any change in Medicare or Medicaid =
that cuts benefits for ordinary Americans.  Ordinary Americans didn=92t ben=
efit from the party that caused the deficit, and they shouldn=92t be asked =
to pay the bill.
=20
     Maybe the most outrageous proposal coming out of the =93big thinkers=
=94 who flack for Wall Street and the CEO class, is the proposal to raise t=
he Social Security retirement age.
=20
       Remember that Social Security has absolutely nothing to do with the =
deficit.  In fact the Social Security Trust Fund has been in surplus since =
it was reformed in 1980.  Regardless, the one percent crowd insists that So=
cial Security is  =93unsustainable=94 in its current form and the way to fi=
x it is to require that everyone retire later.
=20
     That may make sense to editorial writers or business executives who lo=
ve their jobs, make big salaries and have no intention of retiring at 65.  =
It makes no sense at all to people who do manual labor or clean hotel rooms=
 and are paid a minimum wage.
=20
      The people making these proposals will never be affected by increasin=
g the retirement age.  The people who are being asked to sacrifice are gene=
rally the people who work the hardest for the lowest pay and have not benef=
ited at all from the economy growth that their labor helped to fuel over th=
e last 30 years.
=20
      This proposal is particularly outrageous when you realize that the pa=
yroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare don=92t apply to inco=
me over $110,000 per year.  If everyone paid the same percentage of their i=
ncome in payroll taxes as a the average American that earns $50,000 per yea=
r, the Social Security Trust Fund would be solvent for the next 75 years.=
=20
=20
       When wealthy executives who make millions say that America can=92t =
=93afford=94 the current Social Security and Medicare programs, what they r=
eally mean is that they don=92t want to pay their fair share to support the=
se critical programs.   What they are really saying is that they have a rig=
ht to take all of the increased economic growth that our society generates =
over the next three decades the same way they have for the last 30 years.
=20
      It is up to Democrats =96 to all everyday middle class Americans -- t=
o just say no to the greed and arrogance that underlies their proposals tha=
t everyday Americans should have to sacrifice more, so that the 1% doesn=92=
t have to pay its fair share.=20
=20
     It=92s time we refuse to give any credibility whatsoever to their absu=
rd assertions that increasing taxes on the rich will slow the economy by pu=
nishing =93job creators.=94  In fact, economic history =96 and most recentl=
y the Clinton years =96 demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt -- that e=
conomies grow from the middle out, not the top down.  Economic history demo=
nstrates that the best way to grow an economy is to make sure that ordinary=
 American consumers have growing incomes that will allow them to buy the go=
ods and services that their increased productivity can produce.   Middle cl=
ass consumers with money in their pockets are the true =93job creators.=94=
=20
=20
     Republican policies that allow the wealthy to continue siphoning off a=
ll of our growth in national income are the true enemy of long-term economi=
c growth.  They are a formula for economic stagnation because they are a re=
cipe for the destruction of America=92s middle class.
=20
      It=92s up to us to demand that Wall Street gamblers who don=92t make =
anything of value should no longer be allowed to pay a smaller share of the=
ir income in taxes than teachers or firefighters or the millions of America=
ns who go to work every day and actually create the goods and services that=
 people need to live more fulfilling lives.
=20
      And it=92s up to the media to understand that in the final analysis, =
the Lame Duck budget battle is not about policies and programs at all =96 i=
t=92s about right and wrong.
