Yep, the NEA alternatives I outlined below are what the NEA would like us
to commit to (all of them) in place of our absence at the RA.  I think
Robby when we meet with Carrie on Friday next week we should be ready to
commit to what we're willing to do then.  She will expect that at the
meeting I believe.  I'll be there with you too.

I got pushed on NEA today by NH local as well.
It's going to be an issue.  Wonder if we can do the alternatives as
replacement.

Thanks for the update.  On the NEA piece, I don't know if this is the right
thing to say, but the no-conference position is really a go to all the
Labor conferences in the hopes of earning a endorsement.  We're not trying
to earn NALEO's endorsement.  Not sure how to finagle that in conversation
but that is ultimately what it is

I'm good with the Alliance for Retired Americans surrogate, think it makes
sense

Was the UAW date on our radar before?  that could be difficult....
