John --


Since we asked you to take a stand last week, over 900 of you signed our =
petition telling Congress that we won't accept irresponsible sequester =
cuts. That's great! And it proves this issue seriously hits home for you.

Take the Rock Island Arsenal right here in Illinois' 17th district: the =
sequester budget cuts are having a seriously detrimental effect on =
civilian workers. How? Let's break it down:

A minimum of 11 unpaid days off
A 500,000 hour cut for the entire Arsenal workforce
An average of $3,000 in wage losses for each of six thousand employees =
(that's $18 million total!)
Middle-class families simply cannot afford these cuts -- and Congress =
needs to fix this NOW. Cheri's working hard to find a solution, but she =
needs your help.

Stand with Cheri: Will you sign your name to help us reach 1,000 strong to =
STOP the sequester and support Illinois workers?

We all know these cuts are wrong, now we need to do something about it.

Thanks for stepping up,

Team Bustos
