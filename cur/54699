also for schedule - Laura Meckler wants to do an online/video interview
with you and print piece.

lets discuss timing, could do in line with one of our upcoming policy roll
outs -
middle class tax cuts / you could talk about contrast with republicans; or
healthcare ?

Happy to have john do that video. Adding Brian and Sara for awareness.

with the secretary and as I suspected, he said he wouldn't.

Also, a while back we talked about doing a video interview with Podesta for
wsj.com (and obviously a print story too). We sort of put that on hold
while hoping for an HRC interview but given that this does not seem to be
in the immediate future (!) reminding you we'd be interested in the Podesta
on-record, video sit-down. I didn't talk to him about it today but when I
first mentioned it, he said it was up to you anyway. :)

I got home just in time tonight to start reading Hillary emails, which I'm
taking a break from to write this email. I am still hopeful I will get to
sleep tonight.
