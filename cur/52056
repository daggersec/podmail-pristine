Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign will center on boosting econ=
omic security for the middle class and expanding opportunities for working =
families, while casting the former senator and secretary of state as a "ten=
acious fighter" able to get results, two senior advisers said Saturday.

They provided the first preview of the message that Clinton planned to conv=
ey when she launches her long-anticipated campaign on Sunday with an online=
 video. Until now, the former first lady has offered only hints of what wou=
ld drive her if she were to run a second time for theWhite House<http://abc=
news.go.com/topics/news/us/white-house.htm>.

The strategy described by Clinton's advisers has echoes of President Barack=
 Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. He framed the choice for voters as betw=
een Democrats focused on the middle class and Republicans wanting to protec=
t the wealthy and return to policies that led to the 2008 economic collapse=
.

The advisers said Clinton will argue that voters have a similar choice in 2=
016. Clinton also intends to sell herself as being able to work with Congre=
ss, businesses and world leaders.

That approach could be perceived as a critique of Obama, Clinton's rival fo=
r the nomination in 2008. He has largely been unable to fulfill his pledge =
to end Washington's intense partisanship and found much of his presidency s=
tymied by gridlock with Congress.

The Clinton advisers spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss he=
r plans ahead of Sunday's announcement. People familiar with the plans say =
Clinton will travel to Iowa<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/iowa.htm> and=
 other early-voting states to hold small events with residents in the days =
after the video's release.

Clinton is not expected to roll out detailed policy positions in the first =
weeks of her campaign. Advisers said she planned to talk about ways familie=
s can increase take-home pay, the importance of expanding early childhood e=
ducation and making higher education more affordable.

It's not yet clear whether that will include a noticeable break with Obama =
on economic policy. The GOP has hammered Obama's approach as anti-business =
and insufficient in the wake of the recession. The White House says the eco=
nomy has improved significantly in recent years.

The unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in March, but manufacturing and n=
ew home construction slowed, cheaper gas has yet to ignite consumer spendin=
g and participation in the labor force remains sluggish.

Clinton will enter the race as the overwhelming favorite for her party's no=
mination. Still, her team has said her early strategy is designed to avoid =
appearing to take that nomination for granted.

The early events will include discussions at colleges, day care centers and=
 private homes, and stops at coffee shops and diners. After about a month o=
f such events, Clinton will give a broader speech outlining more specifics =
about her rationale for running.

In 2008, Clinton followed a video announcement with a large rally in Des Mo=
ines, Iowa.

Clinton's husband, Bill, and daughter, Chelsea, are unlikely to appear at h=
er early events. Bill Clinton<http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/bill-cli=
nton.htm>, the former two-term president, said recently that he wanted to p=
lay a role as a "backstage adviser" in his wife's campaign.

Advisers said Bill Clinton has been engaged with his wife in some of the po=
licy discussions leading up to this weekend's rollout.

To prepare for the campaign, Clinton has spent months meeting with economic=
 policy experts, including Heather Boushey, whose research focuses on inequ=
ality, and Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and retirement policy expe=
rt. The policy development process has been overseen by aides Jake Sullivan=
 and Dan Schwerin.

In the days before her announcement, Clinton has been holding lengthy meeti=
ngs with her staff, sometimes joining them at her crowded personal offices =
in midtown Manhattan and other times participating by phone.

Clinton's growing team of staffers began working out of a new campaign head=
quarters in Brooklyn on Friday.

She is expected to reach out to donors in the coming weeks, but does not pl=
an to headline many fundraising events over the next month.
