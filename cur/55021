Hi --

Many thanks,

*A full transcript of the video is below:*



Hello.  I=E2=80=99m Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federa=
tion of
America.



Planned Parenthood provides a full range of health care services to
millions of women, men, and young people every year, including cancer
screenings, birth control, STD testing and treatment, and abortion. And we
provide much more than health services =E2=80=93 we support millions of peo=
ple as
they build their futures and pursue their goals.



Recently, an organization that opposes safe and legal abortion used
secretly recorded, heavily edited videos to make outrageous claims about
programs that help women donate fetal tissue for medical research.



I want to be really clear: The allegation that Planned Parenthood profits
in any way from tissue donation is not true. Our donation programs =E2=80=
=93 like
any other high-quality health care providers =E2=80=93 follow all laws and =
ethical
guidelines. Over our 100-year history, we have continually engaged leading
medical experts to shape our practices, policies, and high standards =E2=80=
=93 and
always will.



Our top priority is the compassionate care that we provide. In the video,
one of our staff members speaks in a way that does not reflect that
compassion. This is unacceptable, and I personally apologize for the staff
member's tone and statements.



As always, if there is any aspect of our work that can be strengthened, we
want to know about it, and we take swift action to address it.



Planned Parenthood stands behind our work to help women and families donate
tissue for medical research when they wish to. It is always their decision.




I thank those women and families who have chosen tissue donation at some
point in their lives.  Your commitment to lifesaving research, developing
treatments for diseases like Parkinson=E2=80=99s and Alzheimer=E2=80=99s, i=
s important and
compassionate, and it should be respected =E2=80=93 not attacked.



We know the real agenda of organizations behind videos like this, and they
have never been concerned with protecting the health and safety of women.
Their mission is to ban abortion completely and cut women off from care at
Planned Parenthood and other health centers.



We will never let that happen.
