Questions Remain About McCain=B9s Role In Airbus Deal
GAO Ruling Puts Spotlight On Flawed Process

Washington, DC =AD Campaign Money Watch, a campaign finance watchdog group,
said that the Government Accountability Office=B9s report finding errors in
the awarding of an Air Force contract sheds new light on Sen. John McCain=B9=
s
intervention in the deal. The GAO ruled today in support of Boeing=B9s
complaint that the Air Force erred in awarding a French firm, Airbus, and
its partners a contract worth up to $100 billion to manufacture refueling
tankers.=20

=B3We now know that the Air Force=B9s bidding process was flawed when it awa=
rded
the contract to Airbus and its partners over Boeing,=B2 said David Donnelly,
director of Campaign Money Watch. =B3What we do not yet know is whether John
McCain's well-documented intervention to help Airbus, or the role that
lobbyists for Airbus now helping McCain's campaign, will be identified as
reasons for the flaws in this process. We look forward to the full release
of the GAO report.=B2

A June 6th Campaign Money Watch analysis described that U.S. employees of
Airbus=B9 parent, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, had donated more
money to McCain than any other politician. Two of the seven Airbus lobbyists
who went on to help with McCain=B9s presidential bid =AD Tom Loeffler and Ki=
rk
Blalock =AD have both raised at least $250,000 for the McCain campaign.

The watchdog group also recently ran a TV ad in the Washington, D.C.,
market, detailing McCain=B9s involvement in the Airbus deal. The ad and its
supporting documentation are available at
http://www.campaignmoney.org/mccainairbus.

Campaign Money Watch is a project of the nonpartisan Public Campaign Action
Fund. The organization works to hold candidates who are against reform
accountable for where they get their political donations.
