Hey folks,

*"They" say voters don't care about the ads and who's behind them, but we
have a brand new poll that shows the exact opposite. *

We did a poll last night in Colorado, Illinois, and nationally that shows
without a doubt, voters want right to know who is funding outside ads, that
it influecnes their election decisions, and here's the zinger:

*Voters are less likely to trust that candidates backed by anonymous ads ar=
e
going to improve economic conditions for them and their families. *

Here's *Greg's Plum Line pos*t on it (and again he's leading the charge on
this relentlessly):
http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/10/yes_voters_do_care_about=
.html

Here's a link to the *full polling memo*:
http://s3.moveon.org/pdfs/disclosure_polling_memo.pdf

*Here's top line findings from the national poll:*




   - An overwhelming 84% of voters polled, including 80% of Republicans and
   81% of Independents, believe v*oters have a right to know who is paying
   for ads* for a particular candidate.
   - Fifty-six percent of voters overall (including 53% of Independents) ar=
e
   l*ess likely to vote for a candidate if they know the ads supporting tha=
t
   candidate are paid for by anonymous corporations and wealthy donors.*
   - Forty-seven percent of all voters are *more likely to support a
   candidate who insists that voters have a right to know who is paying for=
 ads
   *, with only 9% of total voters saying they are less likely to support a
   candidate who holds that position.
   - Almost two out of three voters (63%) *do not believe that the anonymou=
s
   groups running ads hold the voters=92 best interest in mind*. This belie=
f
   is held by 65% of Independent and 70% of Democratic voters.
   - A straight majority of total voters (53%) are *less likely to trust a
   candidate to improve economic conditions* if that candidate is supported
   by anonymous groups.
