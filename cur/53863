><br></span>PRESCOTT, Ariz. -- Sen. John McCain &lt;<a onclick=3D"return to=

.com/congress/members/m000303/" target=3D"_blank">http://projects.washingto=

at will let an Arizona rancher trade remote grassland and ponderosa pine fo=
rest here for acres of valuable federally owned property that is ready for =
development, a land swap that now stands to directly benefit one of his top=
 presidential campaign fundraisers.<span class=3D"q"><br>
<br>Initially reluctant to support the swap, the Arizona Republican became =
a key figure in pushing the deal through Congress after the rancher and his=
 partners hired lobbyists that included McCain&#39;s 1992 Senate campaign m=
anager, two of his former Senate staff members (one of whom has returned as=
 his chief of staff), and an Arizona insider who was a major McCain donor a=
nd is now bundling campaign checks.<br>
<br>When McCain&#39;s legislation passed in November 2005, the ranch owner =
gave the job of building as many as 12,000 homes to SunCor Development, a f=
irm in Tempe, Ariz., run by Steven A. Betts, a longtime McCain supporter wh=
o has raised more than $100,000 for the presumptive Republican nominee. Bet=
ts said he and McCain never discussed the deal.<br>

e</a>&gt;&nbsp; described the exchange as the largest in Arizona history. T=
he swap involved more than 55,000 acres of land in all, including rare expa=
nses of desert woodland and pronghorn antelope habitat. The deal had suppor=
t from many local officials and the Arizona Republic newspaper for its expa=
nsion of the Prescott National Forest. But it brought an outcry from some A=
rizona environmentalists when it was proposed in 2002, partly because it we=
nt through Congress rather than a process that allowed more citizen input.<=
span class=3D"q"><br>
<br>Although the bill called for the two parcels to be of equal value, a fe=
deral forestry official told a congressional committee that he was concerne=
d that &quot;the public would not receive fair value&quot; for its land. A =
formal appraisal has not yet begun. A town official opposed to the swap sai=
d other Yavapai Ranch land sold nine years ago for about $2,000 per acre, w=
hile some of the prime commercial land near a parcel that the developers wi=
ll get has brought as much as $120,000 per acre.<br>
<br>In an interview, Betts said there is &quot;absolutely no&quot; connecti=
on between his contributions to McCain&#39;s presidential bids and the deal=
 involving rancher Fred Ruskin and the Yavapai Ranch Limited Partnership. W=
hile his company&#39;s possible involvement was discussed casually before t=
he bill&#39;s passage, Betts said SunCor did not sign on to the project unt=
il afterward. &quot;At no time during the consideration of this legislation=
 was there any involvement by officials of SunCor,&quot; McCain spokesman B=
rian Rogers said in a written response to questions.<br>
<br>Betts is among a string of donors who have benefited from McCain-engine=
ered land swaps. In 1994, the senator helped a lobbyist for land developer =
Del Webb Corp. pursue an exchange in the Las Vegas area, according to the C=
enter for Public Integrity. McCain sponsored two bills, in 1991 and 1994, s=
ought by donor Donald R. Diamond that yielded the developer thousands of ac=
res in trade for national parkland.<br>
<br>In the late 1990s, McCain promoted a deal in Arizona&#39;s Tonto Nation=
al Forest involving property part-owned by Great American Life Insurance, a=
 company run by billionaire Carl H. Lindner Jr., a prolific contributor to =
national political parties and presidential candidates.<br>
<br>With the federal government owning vast stretches of Arizona land, and =
with pressure to meet increasing housing demands, McCain now views land swa=
ps as beneficial, Rogers said. &quot;He certainly recognizes that there hav=
e been well-documented abuses of legislative land exchanges, but every land=
 exchange bill introduced by Senator McCain has been written with the highe=
st regard for the public interest.&quot;<br>
<br>As McCain positions himself as a champion of environmental causes, obse=
rvers of the Yavapai Ranch swap say it shows a paradox in the senator&#39;s=
 positions. At times, he has fought to protect the delicate desert ecosyste=
m. But when wildlife concerns have thwarted development, his loyalties have=
 shifted.<br>
<br></span>&quot;When the public trust intersects with private interests, b=
asically, he has favored land development . . . in every case,&quot; said R=
ob Smith, director of the Sierra Club &lt;<a onclick=3D"return top.js.OpenE=

d/topic/Sierra+Club?tid=3Dinformline" target=3D"_blank">http://www.washingt=
onpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Sierra+Club?tid=3Dinformline</a>&gt; &#39;s Ar=
izona affiliate.<span class=3D"q"><br>
<br>McCain also has been critical of government&#39;s &quot;revolving door,=
&quot; which allows former government officials to position themselves as i=
nfluential lobbyists. Rogers said that McCain does not recall being lobbied=
 by his former staff members on the land swap and that &quot;no lobbyist in=
fluenced Senator McCain on this issue.&quot;<br>
<br>The Yavapai exchange idea surfaced a decade ago as area land values soa=
red. Ruskin and his siblings for years have used the inherited property as =
a cattle operation.<br><br>Development was complicated, because the land wa=
s intertwined with federally owned forest, creating what land management of=
ficials call &quot;the checkerboard.&quot; Ruskin&#39;s ranch and the feder=
al property comprise alternating square-mile plots across swaths of norther=
n Arizona.<br>
<br></span>For the U.S. Forest Service &lt;<a onclick=3D"return top.js.Open=
ExtLink(window,event,this)" href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/relat=

/a>&gt; , the tangle of public and private property posed a management head=
ache. For Ruskin and his family, it became an opportunity.<span class=3D"q"=
><br>
<br>Ruskin said he spent months researching federal land exchanges, and dec=
ided the regular process used by the Forest Service would be too complicate=
d to ever get done. The trade he wanted would involve three cities, three n=
ational forests, two counties and 15 land parcels. He persuaded then-Rep. J=
.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.) to draft a bill proposing the exchange of 35,000 acr=
es of ranch property for 21,000 acres of federally owned Arizona land.<br>
<br>Ruskin set his sights on prime development property astride a major int=
erstate, land adjacent to the Flagstaff airport and a contiguous stretch of=
 the ranch that would allow housing development. He estimated that the ranc=
h land, if subdivided and developed, would easily sell for more than $250 m=
illion -- and that had to be calculated into any swap.<br>
<br>At first, the trade appeared to have broad support, but opposition soon=
 developed. Clarkdale Mayor Doug Von Gausig, whose house overlooks the Verd=
e River, said he feared that development would overtax an already fragile w=
ater source.<br>
<br>Other critics included a national taxpayer group that questioned the la=
nd values. &quot;It was just a bad deal -- a rip-off to the public,&quot; s=
aid Janine Blaeloch, who heads the Western Lands Project, another opponent =
of the legislation.<br>
<br>McCain initially withheld support for Hayworth&#39;s bill, which failed=
 in 2002. Ruskin saw McCain&#39;s restraint as an obstacle. He said Senate =
staff members warned him that the senator was wary of a swap because &quot;=
he spent some political capital and got some bricks thrown at him&quot; ove=
r the Tonto National Forest deal.<br>
<br>Ruskin, who is a pediatrician by training, said he realized he needed t=
o hire lobbyists &quot;to open communications with McCain&#39;s office.&quo=
t;<br><br>He turned to some of McCain&#39;s closest former advisers. In 200=
2, he sought out Mark Buse, McCain&#39;s former staff director at the Senat=
e commerce committee, which the senator chaired.<br>
<br>&quot;I had gone to him to see if he had any advice as to how to deal w=
ith McCain,&quot; Ruskin said. &quot;We had a couple of meetings and I paid=
 him a little bit.&quot; Buse&#39;s federal lobbying records do not list th=
e ranch as a client.<br>
<br></span>That year, lobbying records show, Ruskin also paid $60,000 to Mi=
chael Jimenez, another former McCain aide. Wes Gullett, who had worked in M=
cCain&#39;s Senate office, managed his 1992 reelection bid, and served as d=
eputy campaign manager for his 2000 presidential run, also lobbied on the b=
ill, documents show. The watchdog group Public Citizen &lt;<a onclick=3D"re=

Foundation?tid=3Dinformline</a>&gt;&nbsp; lists Gullett and his wife, Debor=

lett&#39;s partner, Kurt R. Davis, another McCain bundler and member of the=
 senator&#39;s Arizona leadership team, to work with local officials and &q=
uot;to help with McCain if we needed help.&quot; Buse, Jimenez and Gullett =
did not return calls seeking comment.<span class=3D"q"><br>
<br>Davis said that he and Gullett were not hired just to win over McCain. =
&quot;Each member has issues that are more important to them. You have to b=
e able to address their individual concerns. We had familiarity with the is=
sues important to McCain.&quot; In this case, Davis said, &quot;Senator McC=
ain was very, very engaged and concerned about water issues.&quot;<br>
<br>In April 2003, McCain introduced his version of a land-swap bill. But h=
e remained reluctant about the exchange, speaking to opponents and organizi=
ng meetings in towns that would be most affected.<br><br>Flagstaff Mayor Jo=
seph C. Donaldson, a supporter of the swap, said McCain&#39;s hesitation st=
emmed from his &quot;insistence that the environment be protected.&quot; Bu=
t opponents were baffled by the senator&#39;s seemingly contradictory posit=
ions. Said Blaeloch: &quot;The bizarre thing to me regarding McCain is, we =
spent a lot of time with his staff, and we all seemed to be on the same pag=
e about the problems with this swap. But somehow, John McCain kept pushing =
it forward.&quot;<br>
<br>Ruskin said a &quot;crucial meeting&quot; occurred on Aug. 4, 2004, whe=
n McCain added a provision aimed at appeasing many opponents. It created a =
management group that would monitor water reserves and document any danger =
to the Verde River.<br>
<br>The legislation also was revised to mandate that the parcels in the exc=
hange be of &quot;equal value.&quot; Forest Service officials say they can =
adjust the amount of property given to Ruskin to ensure that each side gets=
 an equal share of land. Blaeloch and some other opponents remained concern=
ed that appraisals could still be manipulated. The language helped win Sena=
te passage on July 16, 2005.<br>
<br>Ruskin said he first engaged in confidential discussions with SunCor in=
 2003. Betts said the company was not &quot;really interested in spending a=
 lot of time on it until we knew if the legislation would pass.&quot;<br>
<br></span>Ruskin said SunCor officials formally expressed interest in Octo=
ber 2005, a month before President Bush &lt;<a onclick=3D"return top.js.Ope=

hingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/George+W.+Bush?tid=3Dinformline</a>&gt;&n=
bsp; signed the bill into law.<span class=3D"q"><br>
<br>In Arizona, SunCor is a subsidiary of Pinnacle West, the state&#39;s la=
rgest power company. Betts, as Ruskin described him, &quot;politically is a=
 very powerful guy in the state.&quot;<br><br>Officials from the company an=
d its subsidiaries have accounted for $100,000 in contributions to McCain&#=
39;s political campaigns over the years, records show.<br>
<br>SunCor is now working directly with the Forest Service to complete the =
swap, which has been delayed by administrative glitches.<br><br></span>As f=
or McCain, some in the Verde Valley say they counted on him to broker a dea=
l that would protect their precious river. Von Gausig now heads the water m=
anagement commission that McCain added to the bill to gain community suppor=
t. The Congressional Budget Office &lt;<a onclick=3D"return top.js.OpenExtL=
