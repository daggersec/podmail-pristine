John --

Last year, you elected me because I promised to fight the gridlock in =
Washington.

So when I heard ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling is on the verge of getting =
back in this race, I couldn't help but remember some of his greatest hits. =
Here's a reminder:

He voted in favor Paul Ryan's Medicare-destroying budget
He supported Todd Akin's bill to redefine rape
He walked out of a town hall meeting with local workers who were losing =
their jobs to Chinese outsourcing

Bobby Schilling did not beat the gridlock -- he was the gridlock! And we =
can't let him return to Washington.

But John -- make no mistake, this will not be easy. Schilling's backers =
will bring millions of dollars of outside money into this race. Last cycle =
our race was one of the most expensive in the entire country -- Super PAC =
cash poured into the district to attack me and cover for Schilling. We =
have to be ready for whatever is coming.

Will you chip in $10 or whatever you can right now to help me take on =
Bobby Schilling and his Super PAC backers?
http://action.cheribustos.com/june14-1

Since my election, I've worked day and night to get things done for the =
17th district: I'm currently fighting to stop the student loan rate hike; =
I'm working with Senator Durbin on combating crime in Rockford; and I met =
with Amtrak officials to help bring rail to the Quad Cities.

We can't let someone like Schilling -- who cares more about his own deep =
pockets than the needs of his constituents -- make a comeback.

Please give whatever you can to make sure we lay a strong foundation =
against Bobby Schilling.

Thanks,

Cheri
