This is a must watch. George pressed him on supporting nationalization of
industries. And he only is "open to looking at" closing the Charleston
loophole

Rough Transcript

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *we just heard from secretary clinton. we're joined
now by senator Bernie Sanders. thank you for joining us again this morning.
senator Sanders, covered a lot of ground with secretary clinton. let's go
over some of the issues yesterday with you. the back and forth yesterday
whether that super pac was going to demand the release of your health
records. secretary clinton has released all of her records, will you?

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *absolutely, of course, i mean, i think she released
a two-page statement on her health records. we'll do the same.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *she welcomes your support of the gun liability.
called it a flip flop. time now for you to closing this charleston
loophole, will you?

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *well, first of all, george, as you know, i have a
d-minus voting record from the nra, in 1988 i probably lost an election
because i was the only candidate who said we should ban assault weapons.
what i said months and months ago was, there were things in the liability
bill that i liked and didn't like, wanted to take a look at this bill, now
that's going to be introduced to review it and make changes to it. i think
the bill makes a lot of sense. what we will do is supportive of this
legislation, there's an amendment, though, that i want to seeis
incorporated that's noncontroversial that immonitors the impact of small
gun shops in rural america. bottom line is, when a gun shop sells a gun
legally to someone and then something bad happens i don't think it --

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *the three-day waiting, the person gets the gun
after three days of waiting no matter.

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *we'll take a look at that as well. the issue is, my
view has always been and most important is that we have a strong instant
background check, i have supported that from day one. i want to see that
expanded and improved. look at the end of the day, what every american
understands we need to keep the guns out of hands of people shouldn't have
guns.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *on health care, you shouldn't tear apart obama
care. people should be defending the affordable care act. so, how high will
the top tax rate go to pay for it, when will those details be out.

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *very shortly. here 's the point, Bernie is going to
dismember health care in the united states of the america, he's going to do
-- millions of people will no longer have the insurance they have, that's
nonsense. what everybody understands, a medicare for all program is
guaranteeing health care to all people. we still have 29 billion americans
who still don't have health care. we spend far, far more per capita on
health care than other countries. i want to fulfill the vision of people
like harry truman and say health care is the right of allep people. i hope
secretary clinton would join me on that saying that and tell the
pharmaceutical industry they can't continue to rip off the american people
and charge us the highest prices in the world.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *isn't it fair for voters in iowa to know now
you're going to pay for it?

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *you know what, george, i mean, sometimes, the
discussion becomes really absurd is that, we'll increase medicare premiums
that is true, but we are doing away with all private health insurance
premiums and sometimes, it disappoints me that the clinton campaign is
sounding like republicans. the truth of the matter is, we spend far more
per person on health care than other countries. i want to fulfill the
vision of people like harry truman and say health care is the right of
allep people. i hope secretary clinton would join me on that saying that
and tell the pharmaceutical industry they can't continue to rip off the
american people and charge us the highest prices in the world.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *isn't it fair for voters in iowa to know now
you're going to pay for it?

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *you know what, george, i mean, sometimes, the
discussion becomes really absurd is that, we'll increase medicare premiums
that is true, but we are doing away with all private health insurance
premiums and sometimes, it disappoints me that the clinton campaign is
sounding like republicans. the truth of the matter is, we spend far more
per person on health care and second of all, medicare for all, single-payer
system, it would lower the cost of health insurance for the middle class of
this country. so, to say yes there will be medicare premiums, yeah, of
course there will be, it's not free.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *don't voters have a right to those details before
they vote? shouldn't this come out before the iowa caucuses?

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *the answer is yes and they will. the answer is
bottom line is, yes, and they will.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *secretary clinton's campaign has been making the
point of leblgtability. karl rove's campaign is now running an ad against
her. in a campaign past positions are going to get scrutiny hp how do you
respond about ads circulating about your past positions? you urged
congressmen to give serious thought the nationalization of the oil industry=
.
 Sanders said, all yutties must be under public ownership.

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *that was a long, long time ago, before i ever was
elected to anything. i was mayor of burlington. people can go back and look
at the fact that hillary clinton was i understand it was a supporter of
barry goldwater. who cares that's a long time ago.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *i was going to ask, what was your thinking then
and what changed your mind?

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *what i said 40 years ago is less important. you talk
about electability. if you look at all of the polls -- almost all of the
polls out there today, today, what you find is Bernie Sanders defeats
donald trump by a much larger margin than does hillary clinton in the last
national poll, we beat trump by 13 points. if you look at the battle ground
states in new hampshire and iowa, we beat them. our appeal is not only to
democrats, young people, working-class people but to independents as well.
if you're concerned or if the american people are concerned about which
candidate has the best opportunity to defeat right-wing republicans i think
you're looking at him, Bernie Sanders.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *those positions you completely disavow them?

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *you know, george, i have been unelected official for
25 years.  yes, those positions are what were before i assumed any office.
i have a record of eight years as major of the city of burlington. and in
the senate. i'm very proud of that record. going back 40, 50 years, that's
fine. i don't think people give much kreecredence to that.

*GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: *thank you.

*SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: *thank you.
