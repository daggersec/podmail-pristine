Spoke to Dick and Carol re Ruy.  Dick says they can't afford to pay him.  B=
ut want to keep a small role with him because like him and good to be colla=
borating with us on the path to the merger, which we all want however circu=
itous the route.

We'd told Ruy we'd go up to 40% of 100k plus share of benefits.  If they dr=
op him, we pay all of benefits.  And he'd be down 10% rather than up 15%.  =
(of course recognizing I am sure he has sold 150% or more.  Our base for hi=
m is only 100k.  I promised a base raise of a COLA level -- to 105 or 110 -=
- nothing dramatic).   I told Dick I would look at Ruy's workplan and see i=
f we could carve out a part of it that would continue to be joint -- for a =
token or in kind or something -- but we'd take primary and help them retain=
 a relationship with him.  I also said we'd look for ways for new econ coll=
aboration again.

But I spoke to Carol after I spoke to Dick.  She was blunter.

What they really want is for us to pay him (maybe the full 50%) but let him=
 continue to be a joint cap and TCF fellow and publish for them too.  Argum=
ent is that, while we're paying all and they nothing, the collaboration is =
good for the two on route to the merger.  Wouldn't ask but for that prospec=
t and their tough times.

Hard to say no if we think merger is still an option.   I said i needed to =
think.  would be back this week.  Its tricky but we'll get same amount of w=
ork from him either way -- and so letting them free ride on that seems okay=
 to me in this unusual circumstance.  You okay with that?

On a related matter, Dick has now twice sounded downright depressed about h=
is lack of engagement with transition, not being brought in to advise in an=
y way.  He doesn't seem to be angry at you -- just frustrated that he's so =
far out of the loop on things.  I hated to mention it to you -- last thing =
you need is more to worry about or to feel bad about others' unrealistic ex=
pectations.  But given the friendship and long-term prospects for merger, t=
hought you would want to know.  He claims his primary focus is his own daug=
hter's job prospects.  Gather she wants to go in but has been told by Reid'=
s people she can't leave for 18 months.  Not sure where that all stands.
