Why Americans Need Unions Now More Than Ever=20

     How often do you hear someone say, =93Oh, at one time unions were a go=
od thing, but not anymore=94?=20

     The premise of this argument is that once upon a time there were robbe=
r barons stalking the land, and it was a fine thing that workers organized =
into unions to prevent them from hiring children and paying employees a pit=
tance as they labored in sweatshops working fifteen-hour days.

     Now, goes the narrative, in the age of high-tech industrial campuses a=
nd =93information=94 workers, unions are =93obsolete.=94

     Next time you hear that argument from an otherwise rational person, gi=
ve them a good shake and insist that they wake up from their dream world.

     The central problem facing the American economy =96 and our society =
=96 is the collapse of the American middle class. The incomes of the middle=
 class Americans, and those who aspire to be middle class  =96 90% of Ameri=
cans -- have been stagnant for almost three decades.   This trend, which wa=
s briefly interrupted during the Clinton Administration, is the chief defin=
ing characteristic of our recent economic history.=20

     This stagnation of middle class incomes has not happened because our e=
conomy has failed to grow over this period.  In fact, real (adjusted for in=
flation) per capita gross domestic product (GDP) increased more than 80% ov=
er the period between 1975 and 2005.  In the last ten years, before the Gre=
at Recession, it increased at an average rate of 1.8% per year.  That means=
 that if the benefits of economic growth were equally spread throughout our=
 society, everyone should have been almost 20% better off (with compounding=
) in 2008 than they were in 1998. =20

     But they weren=92t better off.  In fact, median family income actually=
 dropped in the years before the recession.  It went from $52,301 (in 2009 =
dollars) in 2000 to $50,112 in 2008.  And, of course it continued to drop a=
s the recession set in.

     How is that possible? =20

     Was it =96 as the Right likes to believe =96 because of the growth of =
the Federal Government?  Nope. In fact, the percentage of GDP going to fede=
ral spending actually dropped during the last four years of the Clinton Adm=
inistration. When Bush took office it began to increase again as the Republ=
icans increased spending on wars.  Over the last 28 years, federal spending=
 has averaged about 20.9% of the GDP and varied within a range of only abou=
t 5%, with the high being in 1983 (in the middle of the Reagan years) and t=
he low in 2000 before Bush took office.  It has never even come close to th=
e 43.6% of GDP that it consumed during World War II in 1943 and 1944, or th=
e 41.9% it consumed in 1945.    The percent of GDP that goes to Federal spe=
nding went up in 2009 and 2010 =96 but that was mainly because the economy =
shrunk on the one hand, and a major, temporary stimulus bill was need on th=
e other to prevent another Great Depression.

     Was it because taxes have skyrocketed?  No again.  In fact, according =
to the Census Bureau, the median household tax burden actually dropped from=
 24.9% in 2000 to 22.4% in 2009.=20

     Was it that labor became less productive?  No.  In fact, there has bee=
n a major gap between the increase in the productivity of our workforce and=
 the increase in their wages.  Even when wages were improving at the end of=
 the Clinton years, productivity went up 2.5% per year and median hourly wa=
ges went up only 1.5%.=20

      From 2000 to 2004 worker productivity exploded by an annual rate of 3=
.8% but hourly wages went up only 1% and median family income actually drop=
ped .9%.=20

     The bottom line is that people who work for a living (most of us) are =
getting a smaller and smaller share of the nation=92s economic pie. =20

     In August of 2006, the New York Times reported that Federal Reserve st=
udy showed that, =93Wages and salaries now make up the lowest share of the =
nation=92s gross national product since the government began recording data=
 in 1947; while corporate profits have climbed to their highest shares sinc=
e the 1960.=94=20

     So the answer to the question is simple. Virtually all of the increase=
 in our gross domestic product over the ten years before the Great Recessio=
n went to the wealthiest 2% of the population.

     These changes in income distribution are not the result of =93natural =
laws.=94  They are the result of systems set up by human beings that differ=
entially benefit different groups in the society.=20

     Economist Paul Krugman has summarized the history of income distributi=
on in America.

     At the beginning of the Great Depression, income inequality, and inequ=
ality in the control of wealth, was very high.  Then came the great compres=
sion between 1929 and 1947.  Real wages for workers in manufacturing rose 6=
7% while real income for the richest 1% of Americans fell 17%.  This period=
 marked the birth of the American middle class.  Two major forces drove the=
se trends =96 unionization of major manufacturing sectors, and the public p=
olicies of the New Deal.=20

     Then came the postwar boom, 1947 to 1973.  Real wages rose 81% and the=
 income of the richest 1% rose 38%.  Growth was widely shared, but income i=
nequality continued to drop.

     From 1973 to 1980, everyone lost ground.  Real wages fell 3% and incom=
e for the richest 1% fell 4%.  The oil shocks, and the dramatic slowdown in=
 economic growth in developing nations, took their toll on America and the =
world economy.=20

    Then came what Krugman calls =93the New Gilded Age.=94 Beginning in 198=
0, there were big gains at the very top.  The tax policies of the Reagan ad=
ministration magnified income redistribution.  Between 1980 and 2004, real =
wages in manufacturing fell 1%, while real income of the richest one percen=
t rose 135%.

     The single largest contributor to this stagnation of middle class inco=
mes has been the corporate attack on organized labor.  The percentage of pr=
ivate sector workers in unions has shrunk from 35 percent to 7%.  The excep=
tion has been the public sector, where 35% of teachers, firemen and public =
service workers now have access to collective bargaining.=20

     The last thirty years shows conclusively that the =93competitive marke=
t=94 =96 absent collective bargaining -- simply does not assure that everyd=
ay employees share in the fruits of increased productivity or economic grow=
th.  Left to their own devices, CEO=92s will pad their own massive incomes =
and seek higher returns for the stockholders that hire them. That is especi=
ally true in an economic world that is globalized =96 where CEO=92s can oft=
en hire labor at pennies on the dollar of what they would have to pay in th=
e U.S. =96 if it were not for union contracts.

     Collective bargaining is the only way to level the playing field =96 t=
o assure that increases in American productivity are widely shared througho=
ut the economy.=20

     And when they are not shared, that is not only bad for the everyday fa=
mily.  It is horrible for the economy.  Economies are in balance if product=
ivity gains result in commensurately higher salaries for employees that all=
ow them to buy the larger number of products and services that the producti=
vity increases allow corporations to manufacture and sell.  If they don=92t=
 have increased buying power =96 if all of the income growth goes to the to=
p 2% -- then a demand deficit will inevitably develop that will lead to a r=
ecession =96 or depression.  That gap in buying power can be filled for a w=
hile =96 as it was in the early 2000=92s =96 with greater consumer debt.  B=
ut after while the bubble bursts and the house of cards comes tumbling down=
.=20

     We saw that movie =96 we know the ending.  And it was mainly a result =
of the disparity between increased worker productivity and increased worker=
 income.  It was the direct consequence of the corporate attack on the righ=
t to join a union.

     American workers =96 and the American economy =96 need unions now more=
 than ever.   They are the only means by which we can guarantee widely-shar=
ed economic growth.  And as it turns out, sustained, long-term economic gro=
wth requires widely-shared economic growth.   Unions are the only way to pr=
event the collapse of the American middle class.

     That=92s why the fight in Wisconsin is so fundamental.  Governor Scott=
 Walker and his corporate supporters want to destroy labor unions =96 to el=
iminate the right to choose a union.   They want a low wage economy.  They =
want the freedom to pay people as little as possible at their companies =96=
 and in the government.

     They believe if they can break public employee unions, that they can u=
ltimately eliminate organized labor as a meaningful force in the American e=
conomy =96 and in American politics.

     Walker=92s action are a case study in right wing philosophy.  He cut s=
tate taxes on corporations and then demanded that middle class state worker=
s take cuts in wages and benefits in order to pay for the corporate tax cut=
s=20

     Luckily regular voters have begun to smell the coffee.  Nationally a n=
ew poll shows that 61% of voters reject the kind of proposals that Walker i=
s trying to cram down the throats of the people of Wisconsin.=20

     In Wisconsin itself a new poll by Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research =
found that a majority of Wisconsin voters disapprove of Walker=92s job perf=
ormance and give him a negative favorability of 39 percent favorable and 49=
 percent unfavorable.  In contrast 62 percent of voters offer a favorable v=
iew of public employees and only 11 percent unfavorable.  And 53 percent ra=
te labor unions favorably with only 31 percent unfavorable.

     Over half of the voters oppose the agenda offered by Walker and Republ=
icans in the legislature.  Only 43 percent favor it.  There is a major inte=
nsity gap as well, with 39 percent strongly opposing their proposals and on=
ly 28 percent strongly supporting them.

      In the end, the Republican attack on the right to choose a union comp=
letely ignores what is good for everyday Americans =96 and for the American=
 economy.  It is only concerned with what is good for the narrow economic a=
nd political interests of a tiny fraction of our population.  That=92s why =
they must be defeated.  That=92s why the battle of Wisconsin is really a ba=
ttle for the survival of the American middle class=20
