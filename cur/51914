Dear Wyss Foundation Board,

As we approach the end of the year, I want to share a few highlights of our=
 work in 2015 and updates since the Board meeting in October.

2015 Year in Review

In 2015, the Foundation had a major impact on economic opportunity and wome=
n's equality.  Our grantees secured minimum wage increases for nearly 1 mil=
lion workers, paid sick days for 500,000 people, overtime and wage protecti=
ons for 2 million domestic workers (90% of whom are women) and increased ac=
cess to healthcare through expansion of the Medicaid program for nearly 500=
,000 people.  And, as part of the recent omnibus budget deal, our grantees =
secured a permanent expansion of low income tax credits that lift 16 millio=
n people out of poverty-single mothers are the largest group of recipients =
of this tax credit.  These are victories that significantly impact the live=
s of Americans, particularly women who are more likely to be in low income =
jobs and in poverty.

Despite vitriolic attacks on reproductive rights in the U.S. which reached =
new levels with a high profile smear of Planned Parenthood and a violent at=
tack on a clinic killing 3 people, our grantees in the reproductive rights =
arena have continued to fend off threats to women's health and related righ=
ts. In 2015, grantees secured victories in 21 cases, beat back six bad laws=
 at the state level, and are headed into 2016 anticipating a major decision=
 in the US Supreme Court. In Latin America, our grantees have made progress=
 towards legal access to abortion in Peru, Colombia, Chile and El Salvador.

In 2015 we also saw how investments in the judiciary contribute to progress=
ive victories.  The Department of Labor ruling securing overtime and wage p=
rotections for domestic workers was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for=
 the D.C. Circuit in an opinion written by Judge Sri Srinivasan, who was co=
nfirmed by the Senate in May 2013. His appointment, along with several othe=
r Obama nominees to the same court created a progressive majority.  Progres=
sive judges also played pivotal roles in decisions in reproductive rights c=
ases in 2015, including a  5th Circuit decision keeping Mississippi's only =
abortion clinic open in which the deciding vote was cast by an Obama appoin=
tee, and a 10th Circuit decision rejecting challenges to the Affordable Car=
e Act's contraceptive coverage requirement in which another Obama appointee=
 cast a critical vote.

The new campaign and communications center- approved by the Board earlier t=
his year and tentatively called "the Hub"-is now up and running and will pl=
ay a major role in accelerating our victories in 2016 and beyond.  Arkadi G=
erney became the Hub's Director earlier this month and has already hired a =
staff of three and met with many of our grantees.  He is currently developi=
ng campaign and communications plans on payday loans and voting issues in e=
arly 2016.

Below is a more detailed summary of accomplishments since we were together =
in October.

I hope that each of you has a happy holiday season!  As always, we are grat=
eful for your support and guidance.

Warm Regards,

Molly

Updates since the Board meeting in October:

Economic Opportunity

Expansions to the Earned Income Tax Credit are made permanent. A Foundation=
-supported campaign to make temporary expansions to the Earned Income Tax C=
redit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC) permanent has won an important vict=
ory as part of the end-of-the-year tax and budget deal. 16 million people-h=
alf of whom are children-are lifted out of poverty by the provisions. Over =
the last year and half, Foundation grantees-led by the Center on Budget and=
 Policy Priorities- carried out an impressive campaign to ensure that any l=
arge-scale budget deal included the refundable tax credits.  Ultimately, th=
e White House, Senator Harry Reid (D-NV), and other congressional leaders m=
ade clear that no business tax breaks would move without the low-income cre=
dits. Congress originally made these critical expansions to the program in =
the 2009 stimulus bill, and some of the Foundation's earliest Social Justic=
e grants supported previous victories to extend the program. However, these=
 provisions were set to expire at the end of 2017. The permanent expansion =
of the program gives millions of families much needed and immediate economi=
c security. The National Council of La Raza and United Way Worldwide provid=
ed advocacy muscle for the effort, securing media coverage and sponsoring o=
utreach events in the states. The campaign was supported by analysis from t=
he Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

ACLU files suit to end modern day debtors' prisons in Washington State. The=
 American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in October against Benton C=
ounty in central Washington over its unconstitutional system of collecting =
court-imposed debts. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 3 plaintiffs who su=
ffered serious hardships-incarceration or forced labor- as a result of cour=
t-imposed debts made without a determination of their ability to pay.  This=
 is the third major lawsuit under a new ACLU program - launched with new Fo=
undation support - to protect the poor in the criminal justice system.

Democracy

ACLU challenges Indiana's attempts to exclude Syrian refugees. In November,=
 Governor Mike Pence directed Indiana social services agencies to stop rese=
ttlement of Syrian refugees. As a result, a Syrian family about to make its=
 new home in Indiana was turned away. In response, the American Civil Liber=
ties Union filed suit in federal district court challenging the constitutio=
nality of Pence's actions; the first suit in the country to challenge a gov=
ernor's attempt to shut the door on Syrian refugees.

Oklahoma registers thousands to vote. Foundation grantees Demos and Project=
 Vote reached a settlement with the Oklahoma State Election Board to improv=
e voter registration services at public assistance agencies in July 2015. O=
ne month after the settlement, Oklahoma election officials reported receivi=
ng 1,574 voter registration applications, an increase of almost 520 percent=
.

Lawsuit filed alleging National Voter Registration Act violations. Foundati=
on grantee Demos filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle =
District of North Carolina against several North Carolina officials for fai=
ling to provide federally mandated voter registration opportunities. The le=
gal action comes in the wake of an investigation by Demos showing that Nort=
h Carolina is failing to register eligible voters when they sign up for dri=
vers' licenses.
Reproductive Rights in the U.S.:

Litigation: Court decisions blocking laws designed to limit women's access =
to abortion were secured in six cases this fall.  However, the U.S. Supreme=
 Court also agreed to review a Texas law designed to shut down abortion cli=
nics. The outcome of this case next summer is critical to the future of abo=
rtion care in the U.S.  The Center for Reproductive Rights is bringing the =
case before the Court and grantee Whole Woman's Health is the lead plaintif=
f.  Oral arguments are expected to be scheduled for March 2016.

The Supreme Court also agreed to review another challenge to the birth cont=
rol benefit of the Affordable Care Act. Seven of eight U.S. Courts of Appea=
l have already ruled that requiring health insurance to cover birth control=
 does not violate religious rights. The National Women's Law Center has bee=
n leading coalition efforts to organize around the case and NARAL, UltraVio=
let, and Planned Parenthood are actively involved.

Precedent-setting legislation passed in California: A new law in California=
 requires that information about financial assistance for reproductive heal=
th services be posted in all reproductive health clinics in the state, and =
that any unlicensed anti-choice crisis pregnancy centers must disclose that=
 they are not qualified medical professionals. It is the first statewide bi=
ll of its kind and is a groundbreaking proactive, pro-choice success. The l=
egislation comes after an undercover investigation and subsequent report la=
st year by NARAL exposing the deceptive tactics used by Crisis Pregnancy Ce=
nters to dissuade women from getting abortions, and subsequent advocacy wor=
k and extensive coalition building and organizing done by NARAL and its all=
ies. Advocates plan to push for similar legislation in other states.

Responses to the attacks on Planned Parenthood: At the state level, attempt=
s to "defund" Planned Parenthood and the court cases challenging those effo=
rts are continuing. The governors of Oklahoma and Texas are the latest to a=
ttempt defunding Planned Parenthood health centers. So far federal courts h=
ave blocked the defunding efforts in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Utah on the g=
rounds that the decisions violate patients' freedom of choice of providers.=
 Texas Planned Parenthood affiliates have filed a lawsuit in federal court =
on the same grounds. In Alabama, the state settled its lawsuit and agreed t=
o pay legal fees after a federal judge blocked the state from defunding the=
 health centers.

Reproductive Rights in Latin America:

Colombia: The Constitutional Court of Colombia ruled that healthcare provid=
ers are obligated to provide immediate, comprehensive, confidential and fre=
e medical services, including abortion, to victims of sexual violence. In 2=
014, the Colombian government enacted optional guidelines that were suppose=
d to help victims of sexual violence get comprehensive healthcare services.=
 The result: of the more than 48,000 women who reported sexual violence, 40=
% did not receive the needed medical services. Women's Link Worldwide broug=
ht the case to the Constitutional Court and generated public support for th=
e ruling.

Peru: The Peruvian government has agreed to pay reparations as part of the =
first United Nations ruling on human rights violations in an abortion case.=
 Almost a decade after the U.N. Human Rights Committee declared that Peru's=
 denial of access to legal abortion services is a human rights violation, t=
he government will provide reparations to K.L. - a woman who was forced to =
continue with a pregnancy that put her physical and mental health at risk, =
even though abortion was legal in these circumstances under Peruvian law. T=
he case was brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights and marked the fi=
rst time in history that an international human rights body held a governme=
nt accountable for failing to ensure access to legal abortion services.

El Salvador: The Center for Reproductive Rights has brought international a=
ttention to cases of women wrongfully imprisoned for having miscarriages, m=
ost recently through an historic public hearing at the Inter-American Commi=
ssion on Human Rights about the situation of women incarcerated under the E=
l Savadoran ban on abortion. The hearing received some positive publicity a=
nd was followed by a meeting with eight U.S. State Department officials and=
 a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people and 55 members of Congress urgin=
g Secretary of State John Kerry to press the matter with El Salvadoran offi=
cials. The Center also filed its second case against El Salvador at the Com=
mission on behalf of nine women who, as a result of the country's total abo=
rtion ban, have been imprisoned for attempting abortions.
