You may have heard from Marc already but I saw Logothetis tonight and he sa=
id he's all in for HRC.=20
He'll help financially and wants to make his 2000 properties in the US avai=
lable for the campaign for events etc at no cost and spread the message thr=
ough his company. He said he woke up 3 days ago disgusted with Trump and ma=
de the decision. John, he's preparing a paper summarizing the options for h=
ow he'd like to help, which he'll send to you in a couple weeks. Thanks and=
 hope you both are well! Sincerely, Ami=
