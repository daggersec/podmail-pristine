John --

Don't forget: David Plouffe and I are holding a live, Vote 2010 Strategy =
Session online today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to outline OFA's plan to =
win in 2010.

One of the people in the room for the Strategy Session will be Aswani, a =
student at the University of Maryland and a first-time voter in 2008. =
Early in 2007, he was inspired and driven to volunteer by then-Senator =
Obama's vision. Aswani has already committed to vote again in 2010. But =
there are millions of voters just like him -- and we need to make sure =
they're just as motivated.

Today's session will be a special insider briefing you won't want to miss =
-- you'll get details on what OFA's planning for the midterm elections and =
how you can help candidates fighting for change.

RSVP now -- or tune in here today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time:

http://my.barackobama.com/2010StrategySession6

Talk to you soon,
