Let me offer the following suggestions with respect to how the =
president-elect should interact with Governors.

First step:

Senator Obama should put on his call list the Governors who have just =
been elected or reelected in 2008.  The governorships up in 2008, west =
to east are:

	1.	Washington
	2.	Utah
	3.	Montana
	4.	North Dakota
	5.	Missouri
	6.	Indiana
	7.	North Carolina
	8.	West Virginia
	9.	Delaware
	10.	Vermont
	11.	New Hampshire

	PLUS:

	12.	Puerto Rico
	13.	American Samoa

Second step:

Senator Obama should immediately schedule (as opposed to hold) a meeting =
with Democratic Governors, possibly in Chicago.  Doing it as soon as =
November 10 is problematic.  Because of security details, other =
commitments, etc., governors generally need more notice before =
travelling to a meeting.  I suggest that Obama's team contact Democratic =
Governors as soon as possible after the election for a Chicago meeting =
scheduled for the end of the week of the 10th or the beginning of the =
following week.  I can work with Nathan Daschle on the agenda for that =
meeting.

Third step:

After Obama meets with the Democratic Governors, he should meet with a =
bi-partisan group of Governors.  The easiest way to do this is to meet =
with the executive committee of the National Governors Association, =
perhaps adding in the chair of the DGA and the chair of the RGA.  He =
could request that the bi-partisan Governors form a group to advise him =
on how best to work with states through their budget shortfalls.  Given =
his unique status and the size of his state, a separate call with =
Governor Schwarzenegger of California also makes sense.  Alternatively, =
Obama could simply select a few Republican Governors and a few =
Democratic Governors and form a state budget advisory team.  This would =
enable him to include Governors like Schwarzenegger at the outset.

Let me know what you think.
