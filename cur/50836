Keith,
I can't explain this other than sheer exhaustion.  I know it was deeply
hurtful and we are trying to make it right. I also know as First Lady,
Senator and Secretary she has always tried to do everything she could to
eradicate the disease for good. So I ask you to consider that and balance
that in judging what was a terrible mistake.
John
