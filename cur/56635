Friend,

If there's one thing I've learned in my years representing
the people of Virginia, it's that the best path forward for
our Commonwealth is for all of our elected representatives --
regardless of their political party -- to work together to
pass reforms that will benefit Virginians.

And that's why I'm so proud to support Terry McAuliffe for
Governor. I know he'll continue our important Virginia
tradition of doing whatever is necessary -- including
crossing party lines -- to create meaningful change.

On the other hand, Terry's opponent takes pride in attacking
compromise at every opportunity.

Will you donate $5 or more now to give Terry the resources
he needs to spread his message of economic opportunity
across the Commonwealth and win in November?

http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/stand-with-senator-kaine

Terry has an important fundraising deadline on Sunday, and
what he raises before the deadline will lay the foundation
of his campaign.

Terry is up against the same people -- like the Koch brothers
-- who made my campaign for US Senate last year the home of
more outside spending from Super PACs and secret-money
groups than any other in the country. Last year, we took
them on and won.

It's up to all of us to make sure we do the same thing for
Terry's campaign this year so that he has the resources
necessary to continue the tradition of bipartisan compromise
in Virginia.

Donate $5 or more now before Sunday's critical fundraising
deadline:

Thank you for everything you do,

Tim Kaine
