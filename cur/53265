Breitbart says arrest not related to BigGovernment, but he's paying alleged
wiretap plotter O'Keefe "a fair salary"

January 26, 2010 9:54 pm ET by Media Matters staff

Yesterday, ACORN videographer James O'Keefe was
arrested<http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nola.com%2Fpolitics%2Findex.ssf%2F2010%2F01%2Facorn_gotcha_man_arrested_for.html>
for
an alleged plot to wiretap Sen. Mary Landrieu's phone. Andrew Breitbart,
whose website BigGovernment.com published O'Keefe's ACORN videos, stated
that he pays O'Keefe a "fair salary" so that "when he puts a story out
there, it's on the Breitbart sites, the Big sites, that he can tell people
what transpired." Breitbart also said that O'Keefe "was not involved in
anything that was related to Big Government, or Breitbart.com" when he was
arrested.

From an interview<http://mediamatters.org/rd?to=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hughhewitt.com%2Fblog%2Fg%2F3c0f68ec-ee51-42ae-b9ce-a170d352c202>

HH: I love that, by the way. That is exactly what public figures should do
when they are implicated, even by a complete falsehood in something like
this. They should do what you're doing, which is get out there and say nope,
not me, not now, not ever, never. Last question, in terms of his
relationship with you not connected to this event, are you still, is he in
your employ in any way?

AB: When the story came to us, what I wanted to do was to make sure that the
ACORN story got as much widespread dissemination as humanly possible. The
videos that he independently produced went on YouTube. And so Huffington
Post, every single site put it out there, including my sites. What he does
for the site exclusively is he tells his life rights, basically. So when he
puts a story out there, it's on the Brietbart sites, the Big sites, that he
can tell people what transpired. So...

HH: Do you pay him for that?

AB: Yes.

HH: And are you free to tell me how much you pay him?

AB: I'll...perhaps at another date, but he's paid a fair salary.

HH: Is he...so he is an employee?

AB: I'm not sure that's technically the thing, but yes, he's paid for his
life rights. And he's, you know, he's still...we reserve the right to say
yes or no to any of the stories that he puts up on our site as we do to any
other contributor who comes to the site.

HH: Will it be a mischaracterization to say he was working for you when he
went about this?

AB: Well, I mean, no. He was not involved in anything that was related to
Big Government, or Breitbart.com.
