What a nice lead in Adam for me to also send around the statement we
just put out on the return of slick mitt!  I think he was getting
jealous of all the recent interviews Palin was getting...

(this went out a couple hours ago, I'm late in posting here due to
technical difficulties that Lori helpfully fixed)

AFL-CIO Political Director Karen Ackerman issued the following
statement
in response to Mitt Romney's tired and stale attack on hard working
Americans:

"Mitt Romney lost for a reason -- because Americans rejected the
failed
economic policies of the past that sent jobs overseas, gave CEO's
millions in bonuses, and caused our current economic crisis.

"The AFL-CIO looks forward to working with the Obama Administration
and
Congress to restore workers freedom to bargain and re-build an economy
that works for everyone."

> WASHINGTON, D.C-As the LA Times reported today, conservative support in C=
ongress for President-elect Barack Obama's proposed economic stimulus plan =
is "peeling off<http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-na-=
obama-stim...>" in favor of "alternative ideas that rely even more heavily =
on tax reductions<http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-n=
a-obama-stim...>." Leading this charge, the Republican Study Committee, or =
RSC, released its preferred stimulus outline<http://rsc.price.house.gov/New=
s/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=3D108590> yesterday<http://wonkroom.thinkp=
rogress.org/2009/01/14/rsc-stimulus/>, which Matthew Yglesias noted is a "b=
arrel full<http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/01/stimulus_vs_p=
erman...>" of permanent tax cuts.
>
> Today, Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) convened a hearing<http://www.starexponent=
.com/cse/news/local/article/cantor_announces_m...> to further discuss the i=
deas that the RSC laid out, with testimony provided by former Gov. Mitt Rom=
ney (R-MA), former Ebay CEO Meg Whitman, and Grover Norquist, president of =
Americans for Tax Reform. During the hearing, all the witnesses continued t=
o beat the drum for permanent tax cuts, especially for corporations:
>
> ROMNEY: The best medicine for a sick economy is permanent tax relief... [=
corporate tax cuts] would remove fear and replace it with confidence and pr=
osperity.
>
> WHITMAN: The number one thing that I would look at for this group is: can=
 we lower business taxes?...I would argue that permanency and clarity are w=
hat to look for.
>
> NORQUIST: I would argue for permanent tax cuts...That would create real a=
nd permanent stimulus.
>
> Cutting corporate taxes is a tired conservative solution to just<http://w=
onkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/09/29/irish-tax/> about<http://wonkroom.thin=
kprogress.org/2008/10/28/boehner-tax/> everything<http://wonkroom.thinkprog=
ress.org/2009/01/07/chamber-stimulus/>. Remember, it was a centerpiece<http=
://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/09/05/mccain-jobs/> of Sen. John McCain'=
s (R-AZ) presidential campaign, even before the economic crisis hit. But as=
 the Center for American Progress' Will Straw wrote, permanent corporate ta=
x cuts simply fail<http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/01/case_econ=
_stimulus.html> to provide stimulus:
>
> The track record for such steps is poor in general, but they are particul=
arly ill-suited for a recessionary period. After all, the reason that busin=
esses and individuals are not investing at the moment has little to do with=
 the taxes they may pay in the future and everything to do with a fear of l=
osing money because there is no demand in the economy, asset prices are hig=
hly volatile, and credit is hard to come by.
>
> Citizens for Tax Justice noted that "every dollar lost from cutting the c=
orporate income tax would increase real GDP by just 30 cents<http://www.ctj=
.org/pdf/recession.pdf>." That's hardly the sort of stimulative effect that=
 would justify slashing the corporate rate.
