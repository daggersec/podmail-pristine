Hi John and Eryn,

How was the S&ED?

We have Kerry coming to speak on India next week. invitations should have
just gone out.

It's been interesting working to get some focus on India, and I hope this
sets a good foundation for the Strat Dialogue, Hagel visit and the
President's meeting with Modi in Sept.

We're using the Kerry speech to launch India 2020 with Rich taking the helm
of a full program. I'm also testifying tomorrow. The Climate and energy
work we've already done should get a good boost out of this.

Progress will require the President and PM to drive the bureaucracies --
look forward to discussing ideas on that front.

Hope all is well.

Vikram
