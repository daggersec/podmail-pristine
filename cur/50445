Obama approaches lawmaker about White House post

By David Espo and Ben Feller, Associated Press, October 30, 2008 7:20 PM

http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jld3VILFDbEY6uciu_lp_YgBnGqwD94543T80

WASHINGTON (AP) - Barack Obama's campaign has approached Illinois Rep.
Rahm Emanuel about possibly serving as White House chief of staff,
officials said Thursday as the marathon presidential race entered its
final, frenzied stretch with a Democratic tilt.

=20

The disclosure came as Republican John McCain, in need of a comeback,
focused on pocketbook issues amid fresh signs of a recession. "Ohio is
hurting now, people in Ohio are having trouble staying in their homes,
keeping their jobs," he said as he set out on a two-day bus tour of the
state.

=20

"We have got to get this economy out of the ditch."

=20

Obama, bidding to become the first black president, also pointed to the
government's report that the economy had declined in the third quarter.
He told a large crowd in Florida that McCain has been perched "right
next to George Bush" for eight years, and consumers are paying a steep
price for their partnership."

=20

The Democrats who described the Obama campaign's approach to Emanuel
spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they were not authorized to be
quoted by name. An aide to the congressman, Sarah Feinberg, said in an
e-mail that he "has not been contacted to take a job in an
administration that does not yet exist. Everyone is focused on Election
Day, as they should be. "

=20

Emanuel is a veteran of President Clinton's White House, and has made a
rapid ascent of the House leadership ladder since his election to
Congress. He was chairman of the Democratic campaign committee two years
ago when the party won a majority for the first time in more than a
decade, and he cemented his reputation as a prodigious fundraiser and
strong-willed political strategist.
