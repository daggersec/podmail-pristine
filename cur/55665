Subject: small idea for you, re: MI water crisis

I know that HRC already addressed the MI water crisis, but there is a
potential new angle that could get a lot of attention in MI since the issue
is so hot.  I believe that all of the GOP candidates oppose the clean water
rule (Waters of the US) promulgated by EPA last year.  Cruz and Paul voted
to block it.  Rubio missed the vote -- shocker.  Jeb and Trump publicly
spoke against it.  (Your research shop can tell you for sure about the
others.)   What about having your MI operation/MI Dem party issue a press
release or some other communication in advance of visits by the GOPers
highlighting their opposition to protection for Flint and MI's drinking
water?  The two aren't that related but the rule is designed to protect
drinking water for 117 million Americans, Great Lakes protection is huge
there etc.  This issue can be used in the fall, too, but now is the time
when it is likely to get the most attention because Flint has been declared
a disaster area, etc.

Any way, just an idea.  Dan W
