Jeb Bush targets Hillary Clinton=E2=80=99s comments on women=E2=80=99s righ=
ts and religious
freedom

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush delivers a speech during the annual
meeting of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce in Columbus, on April 14. (Jonathan
Quilter/Columbus Dispatch via AP)

Religious freedom was a big topic of discussion Saturday night at an Iowa
church
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/26/lots-of-pr=
ayer-but-not-many-specifics-at-gop-summit-in-iowa/?hpid=3Dz4>.
Several Republicans running for president attended the Iowa Faith and
Freedom Coalition -- but Jeb Bush wasn't among them.

He's in Miami Beach this weekend meeting with top donors to his super PAC.
But before the meetings began on Sunday, the former Florida governor sent
messages to his supporter network attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton for
comments she made recently about women's rights.

In remarks Thursday focused on the challenges facing women abroad and in
the United States, Clinton had said that too many women in Africa and
elsewhere still face sexual and domestic violence, too few legal
protections and too little access to health care.

=E2=80=9CYes, we have cut the maternal mortality rate in half, but far too =
women
are still denied critical access to reproductive health care and safe
childbirth,=E2=80=9D Clinton told the Women in the World conference in New =
York.

=E2=80=9CAll the laws we passed don=E2=80=99t count for much if they are no=
t enforced,=E2=80=9D
Clinton continued. =E2=80=9CRights have to exist in practice, not just on p=
aper.
Laws have to be backed up with resources and political will, and
deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to
be changed.=E2=80=9D

Bush seized on those comments in his Sunday e-mail to supporters.

"This week Hillary Clinton said that people's deep-seated religious beliefs
need to be changed in order to advance her own personal political agenda.
Wow," he wrote. "America was founded on religious freedom, and that freedom
is woven into the Bill of Rights as the first guarantee. And strengthening
families is an important element to helping people rise up. This shouldn't
be a partisan political issue, but unfortunately for Hillary Clinton it
sounds like it is."

He amplified his concerns via Twitter
<https://twitter.com/jebbush/status/592359347780513793>:

Although other portions of Clinton=E2=80=99s speech were partisan and aimed
squarely at Republicans, the remark about religious beliefs appeared to be
primarily directed at political and social leaders abroad.

Women=E2=80=99s access to contraception and abortion are limited by many fa=
ctors in
traditional, conservative societies for many reasons, including patriarchal
traditions, poverty and lack of education and medical services.

=E2=80=9CI believe the advancement and the full participation of women and =
girls in
every aspect of their societies is the great unfinished business of the
21st century,=E2=80=9D Clinton added in her Thursday remarks. =E2=80=9CAnd =
not just in
far-away countries but right here in the United States.=E2=80=9D

Bush is hosting meetings with top donors to his Right to Rise PAC on Sunday
evening and Monday at a swanky Miami Beach hotel that opened last month.
Approximately 350 donors will be attending the meeting, which kept Bush
from attending the Faith and Freedom Coalition gathering and the Republican
Jewish Coalition meetings in Las Vegas.

Bush sent surrogates to both meetings. His son, Jeb Bush Jr., spoke on his
behalf in Las Vegas. His brother also addressed the Vegas crowd and said
he'd be lying low

if his brother runs for president in 2016.
