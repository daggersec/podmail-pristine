*Paul Begala*
Sorry to bother you. Had a quick social thing to pass on!
Today at 3:30
(703) 606-4636

*Barbara Boxer*
Things are good! I am going to give you an idea and we can talk if you want
to discuss further. Infrastructure in the terms that people can understand
it. Hillary stands in front of bridges in a swing state. States have
structurally deficient bridges. Senate and House are negotiating a
compromise. Whatever we do will be inadequate but good. If I'm someone who
is getting ready to vote for president would like to say... we're going to
build every structurally deficient bridge. trump is out there in front on
this issue-- but he's so vague. If you want to discuss further. I just want
you to know that you got this message and I'm a happy girl. **Saved in your
voicemails*

*Tanya in Russel Goldsmith's office *
Following up on his email from Oct 22 with policy ideas. Looking to confirm
recept. **Milia will call to confirm receipt and print email for you.*

*Tina Flournoy*
Give me a call.
Thursday at 2:15 pm
(212) 348-2507

*Steve Bachar*
Want to talk about the Lt. Gov slot in CO. Know you talked to John Stocks
last night. Think there's a good play here. Would be important for
Secretary Clinton to have this happen right. Delicate in terms of who the
Gov will listen to you. Will try you back.
Thursday at 11 am

*John Stocks (OBE)*
Give me a call when you get a chance.
