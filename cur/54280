Hi,

Here is my ballot statement.  Please let me know what you think.  I'm
limited to 200 words, where "Dublin Unified School District" counts as one
word. I am currently at 195. Also, I used paragraphs but it will appear as
one large paragraph in the voter guide.  (for the web address I own the
domain but haven't launched it yet so you won't find me yet if you look for
it.

"As trustee of Dublin Unified School District, appointed in January 2013, I
have worked alongside my fellow trustees to provide leadership and
strategic direction to support our excellent public schools.


My top priorities are to make sure our schools remain fiscally sound,
approach learning in a way that values every student, and strengthen
communications and partnerships with families, teachers, staff and
community.


I value stakeholder input and continually seek ways to listen to all voices
and viewpoints.  Dublin is growing and our district is thriving.  We must
keep our focus on student learning while addressing the challenges and
opportunities of growth.


I am a parent of two children in Dublin schools. My husband and I have
lived in Dublin for 17 years.  I am a financial professional with my own
financial planning business in Dublin. I have a BA in math and physics from
Smith College and an MBA from UC Berkeley.


I will use my strong financial background to ensure each year we build a
responsible, thoughtful, and sustainable budget.


It is a privilege to serve our students, families and community as a
Trustee of Dublin Unified School District. I would be honored to have your
vote.  Thank you.
