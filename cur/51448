Dear Professor Podesta,

Sorry to bother you with a clerical question, but after I turned my paper
in yesterday, I noticed that the syllabus said "twenty pages
*excluding*footnotes."  All along I hadn't even considered the
possibility that the
length would be counted as something other than text + footnotes.

My paper was 21 pages with footnotes, and now I've gone back to remove all
of the footnotes, and it's about 16 pages of text.  I think it's a strong
paper, but if the length is a problem, I will spend the day adding to it
(assuming that I can even resubmit).  What would you prefer?

Thanks, and sorry about the confusion,
Brian
