Dear Trustees,

                Teresa's timely note regarding this issue is very much
appreciated.  We discussed at the last Executive Committe spending time at
our February Meeting on the topic of Diversity on Campus as the College
moves toward implementing its Strategic Plan.  We have an Executive Meeting
next Thursday at 2:00PM CST and I recommend that we start the meeting with
an update on this issue and a question and answer session.  We will invite
all Trustees to participate in this discussion.  In the meantime if you
have specific questions that you would like addressed please send them to
Teresa only.


                                            Duke
