- as you probably know there is a federal election campaign ongoing in Cana=
da. The election is October 19. It would be prudent, I believe wearing my f=
ormer ambassador hat, to avoid being seen to take a position on a high prof=
ile issue that could be argued to be intervention in that election. Clearly=
 that would not be her intent but it could be the result. That doesn&#39;t =
mean don&#39;t take a position but it may mean wait until the election is p=

- there is little doubt that our economy will continue to rely on fossil fu=
els for some time into the future. If that is correct then the question is =
how is the most responsible way for the US to do so. Pipelines are unquesti=
onably safer and less damaging to the environment modes of transport for oi=
l than rail. Sourcing oil from Canada is unquestionably better for the US f=
rom an environmental, security and economic point of view (much of the mate=
rial and contractors in the Alberta oil patch are US companies) than gettin=
g it from Venezuela or Africa or the Middle East (we still import a substan=
tial percentage of our oil daily).<br>
- the newly elected government of Alberta is a left of center party that ca=
mpaigned on sensitivity to climate change. They have already acted to raise=
 the levy on carbon (they don&#39;t call it a tax) and are looking to accel=
erate the closer of coal fired electric generating plants (which are on a s=
chedule to close over the next 8-10 years due to federal policy).<br>
- there are so many geo-political and economic positives for North America =
to have the incremental pipeline capacity, if the reason to be skeptical is=
 climate change (although Canadian policy is pretty good via-a-vis the alte=
rnatives) rather than declaring categorical opposition at this stage why no=
t consider indicating conditions (realistic) under which a pipeline would b=

nd local approvals and potentially some additional policies in Alberta (or =
actual performance) that demonstrates incremental gig improvement-say an ad=
ditional 10% reduction in intensity around production.<br>
- bottom line, as you know from years of discussion I believe this is impor=
tant to how we work together in North America. I also believe there is a re=
asoned way to approach this that addresses the legitimate interests of most=
 stakeholders. The kind of approach I am outlining should show concern for =
the environment while also demonstrating appreciation for the economic and =
security considerations. This way Labor and Environmental groups achieve so=
mething. I am more than willing to help think this through further if it is=
