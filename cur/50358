Dear John,

Ten years ago, Yvette Cade's estranged-husband walked in to her place o=
f work, poured gasoline over her head and body, broke her foot so she c=
ouldn't escape and then set her on fire=2E=C2=A0

She survived, but with third degree burns covering most of her body=2E =
She spent 3 months in the hospital in recovery, many more months in phy=
sical therapy and has had nearly three dozen surgeries=2E

In court, we were able to obtain a life sentence for the criminal so he=
 cannot harm any one else every again=2E But that wasn't going to put Y=
vette's life back together again=2E

For survivors and their families, the bruises and scars may heal, but t=
hey carry that burden for life=2E With Yvette's scars, she chose to do =
something very positive and speak out and share her story to bring awar=
eness to the epidemic of domestic violence in this country=2E She has t=
ransformed countless lives by traveling across the country to share her=
 story, which is why I'm sharing it with you today=2E

Her ex-husband exhibited some of the forms domestic violence can take: =
physical and verbal abuse, isolating her from family and friends, stalk=
ing and constantly checking up on her, he engaged in heavy substance ab=
use and was overly jealous=2E

For those who are in abusive relationships like this or at risk, don't =
wait until it's too late=2E Tell your family=2E Tell law enforcement, p=
ut together a safety plan and get out of that relationship=2E There are=
 people who can help you, who care about you and love you=2E In case of=
 an emergency, call 911=2E The domestic violence hotline in Anne Arunde=
l County is 410-222-6800 or 301-731-1203 in Prince George's County=2E O=
therwise, you can call the Maryland Network Against Domestic Violence a=
t (301) 429-3601, or use their state-wide helpline at 800-634-3577=2E=C2=
=A0

I encourage you to share Yvette's story with others and to raise awaren=
ess about domestic violence in our communities=2E Help us educate young=
 men that they can be part of the solution=2E Help us educate young wom=
en that they have options and are not alone=2E

To read Yvette's story in her own words, follow the link here at www=2E=
iveyforcongress=2Ecom/yvettesstory=2E

Let's work to together in the fight against domestic violence,

Glenn
