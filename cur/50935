Subject: You can have them call me. the due process is harder to=20
explain but applying the wrong standard is easy to explain

I am happy to talk to them. I can talk to them any time. better to call=20
late in the day. =C2=A0There are two lawsuits and I want to do =C2=A0both i=
n one=20
law suit. I have to convince others that this is the right thing to do=20
because it was so much more=C2=A0 work. =C2=A0The due process claims are=20
egregious but they have already screwed all the recipients.=C2=A0=C2=A0 If =
there=20
are 100 horses in the barn, 98 or 99 are out of the barn and they have=20
been shot in the meadow. For the second and most important law suit=20
there is a smoking gun. I want to do both of together. But it is=20
killing me. =C2=A0The state is intentionally using the wrong standard in=20
screening the exemption cases. They state is using a standard that is=20
stringent and which has not been in =C2=A0effect since 2000. Unfortunately=
=20
they have special judges hearing =C2=A0these cases and DHCS ha convinced=20
them to review these cases with the wrong standard. =C2=A0This is not=20
incompetence but a purposeful and illegal plan that has hurt a lot of=20
people but the second lawsuit will put them all back on fee for service=20
Medi-cal just as the court did in Lopez v. Heckler in the early 1980=E2=80=
=99s.=20
Javier Portela, courtney Nakayama and Jane Ogle know what they are=20
doing is wrong and they did not care. Jane Ogle like Javier claim they=20
do not have to obey the new law regarding aid paid pending. This is=20
intentional wrongdoing.=C2=A0You asked me what you could do to protect=20
yourself. One is to get the provision repealed that DHCS can make=20
changes without going through the regulatory process. It says they just=20
have to go to the legislative budget committees and the stakeholders=20
but this is not enough protection. Of course they have not=C2=A0 done that=
=20
her because everyone just wrote letters and did nothing. That time is=20
over. These people=C2=A0 all have to be fired because they knew what they=
=20
were doing was illegal. They also purposely underfunded the HCO and=C2=A0=
=20
ombudsman office and changed their duties to be hatchet men for DHCS=20
rather than a source of help for the victims=C2=A0Nancy this is totally=20
wearing me out. But it is the worst thing I have seen in my 40 years as=20
an attorney. These people in DHCS are very bad people. =C2=A0Something=20
should have been done on the front end and not leave it to the old=20
folks like me to clean this up at the back end. Also the DHCS are so=20
full of themselves and think they are above observing the law and have=20
tried to crush the clients I have represented. =C2=A0=C2=A0I came late to t=
he=20
party because we did not start to get people with good facts until=20
April of this year and that was the total end of things. We have told=20
them once,=C2=A0 twice and three times and their solution is a work group=
=20
which is totally ridiculous..
So now that I have figured out the nature of the widespread abuse,=20
=C2=A0they have screwed all the disabled people seeking exemptions.=C2=A0Wh=
ile I=20
will talk=C2=A0 to the press, this is not a one or two day story. They will=
=20
have to read a lot of information to figure out the extent of the=20
wrongdoing. But it is easy to explain that DHCS has purposely applied a=20
far more stringent standard than allowed by law or regulations so they=20
could deny more claims. Also I am too jaded at this point to believe=20
that than any of their figures or data are valid.=C2=A0I do not know when=
=20
the lawsuit will be filed. It will be filed next month. It will be=20
filed later if the =E2=80=9Cwrong standard=E2=80=99 issue is added to the s=
uit but I=20
think this is essential. WE can give you a heads up several days to a=20
week before we file. =C2=A0I am extremely disappointed in LA care because=
=20
they just subcontracted with other plan and are not a public option.=20
People shoved into these plans have their medicines discontinued=20
without warning or notice even when all the other alternatives have=20
been tried. A patient who had 70% of the cancer removed from her brain=20
had her pain medications denied without no notice. The cancer patients=20
and those that have been disabled since children are having the hardest=20
time. Also the folks cannot get timely appoints with the primary=20
physician even if the enrollment has disrupted one=E2=80=99s=C2=A0 cancer t=
herapy.=20
Another stage 4 cancer patient =C2=A0was defaulted into a plan without any=
=20
written notice her exemption was denied right before she was scheduled=20
to have her breast removed. So we are not talking about moral people. I=20
am for capital punishment=C2=A0 or at least putting people in stocks=C2=A0 =
for=C2=A0=20
transgressions like this.=C2=A0Carol Liu, Holly Mitchell and Rod Wright are=
=C2=A0=20
interested. Carol Liu is the most interested. Her chief of staff in=20
