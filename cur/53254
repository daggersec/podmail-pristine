John,<br>
<br>
The Washington Center for Equitable Growth is committed to advancing the st=
ate of knowledge on whether and how economic inequality affects economic gr=
owth and stability. High-quality research and data are core to our mission =
and to the academic research community with whom we work closely. Currently=
, three separate pieces of legislation moving through Congress pose a major=
 threat to the continued integrity of research on economic inequality. Thes=
e bills all have the potential to have a serious impact on your future work=
, and we hope you will weigh in on the policy conversation. <br>
<br>
The three research and data funding issues are as follows:<br>
<br>
<strong>Funding cuts to the U. S. Census Bureau</strong><br>
<br>
The House of Representatives has passed and the Senate is considering an ap=
propriations bill (<a href=3D"http://app.mx3.americanprogressaction.org/e/e=

 that proposes funding significantly below President Obama=E2=80=99s FY 201=
6 budget request. The proposed funding levels in the House and Senate bills=
 would limit the Census Bureau=E2=80=99s support of the release of the 2012=
 Economic Census, hamper planning for the 2017 Economic Census, and elimina=
te the creation of an Administrative Records Clearinghouse. In addition, th=
e House bill would prohibit funding to make responses to the American Commu=
nity Survey mandatory and directs the Census Bureau to submit a plan for th=
e removal of additional questions from the American Community Survey. These=
 changes could limit the quantity, quality, and timeliness of data coming f=
rom the Census Bureau. The Senate now holds the power, and can either make =
amendments to the House-passed bill or block the legislation entirely. Once=
 the Senate acts, the two chambers will then work together create a final v=
ersion to send=20
to the President to be signed into law. <br>=20
<br>
<strong>Funding cuts to the National Science Foundation=E2=80=99s Directora=
te for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences</strong><br>
<br>
The same Commerce, Science, and Justice Appropriation bill (<a href=3D"http=

 also proposes funding well below President Obama=E2=80=99s requested level=
 for the National Science Foundation. The House bill requires that NSF allo=
cate 70 percent of its budget to non-social science, non-geoscience researc=
h, prioritizing funding away from NSF=E2=80=99s Directorate for Social, Beh=
avioral, and Economic Sciences. NSF has, in the past, provided the majority=
 of the federal funds for academic research in the Social, Behavioral, and =
Economic Sciences. By eroding support for researchers, the current effort t=
o cut NSF, and in particular the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Ec=
onomic Sciences, threatens to substantially weaken our nation=E2=80=99s abi=
lity to make evidence-based policy decisions.<br>
<br>
<strong>Restrictions on the Availability of Student-Level Data</strong><br>
<br>
The Student Privacy Protection Act (<a href=3D"http://app.mx3.americanprogr=
essaction.org/e/er?s=3D785&amp;lid=3D174259&amp;elq=3Da32b3d9dcfbc4d999af00=

David Vitter (R-LA) would amend the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act=
 to require educational agencies or institutions to require active parental=
 consent for any research using individual student-level data, among other =
things. Crafting sound, evidence-based education policy rests on the import=
ance of using student-level data in research, and the restrictions in the b=
ill as written could prevent access to quality data.<br>
<br>
Equitable Growth is committed to supporting research that informs the econo=
