Hi everyone -

As you probably recall, the next Board meeting will take place in San Franc=
isco, and will follow up on the Funders Table meetings that will also take =
place there that week.   I have a few requests of all of you ahead of the m=
eeting.  The first is relatively urgent; the others less so.

First, another board member:  What would you think of inviting Christiana F=
igueres to join the Board?  It's a little unorthodox that I would make such=
 a suggestion by email, but here's the backstory:  Charlotte was in Europe =
this past week, where among other things she participated in a discussion w=
ith Christiana and others about her (CF's) next steps, after she leaves her=
 position in July.  That conversation got Charlotte thinking about moving r=
elatively quickly to discuss amongst ourselves (within our CWF Board) the p=
ossibility of approaching Christiana about a spot on the CWF board.  Charlo=
tte and I talked about it today.  I personally think that Christiana would =
be a fabulous addition, and we'd be lucky to have her.   You may have other=
 perspectives, so I'm inviting you to weigh in.  The reason I'm bringing th=
is up by email rather than in Executive Session at the Board meeting itself=
 is timing:  Christiana will be in San Francisco during the week of the Fun=
ders Table, and will likely be leaving town by Friday.  (She has a scheduli=
ng conflict and had to decline our invitation to join our dinner on Thursda=
y.)   If we thought that it were a good idea to raise the topic with CF, Ch=
arlotte would be able to do so during sidebar discussions prior to our meet=
ing.  That would only happen, though, if we all think it's a good idea in g=
eneral and if we think it's a good idea to jump so quickly.  If you think i=
t might be a good idea but you'd like time to discuss it, then of course we=
 will take whatever time is needed to have that discussion.  And some of yo=
u may have reasons to think it's not a good idea at all, so please speak up=
.  In any event, this is a

Second, please get your toasts ready!  This will be Bill Reilly's last boar=
d meeting as 'Emeritus Chair' (after which he'll transition to being invite=
d to special events but will not attend regular board meetings).  At the di=
nner on Thursday evening ahead of the Friday Board meeting, we'll have a ch=
ance to celebrate his service to ClimateWorks from its Day One.  I'm hoping=
 that each of you might be willing to say a very brief word of two to honor=
 him.  Carol, if you think it's appropriate to mention something about his =
prior service at the Packard Foundation, feel free.  And John, if you think=
 there's something special to say about his government service, feel free t=
o add that too.  The Board dinner will also include representatives from th=
e Funders Table foundations, so I think we'll want to make these relatively=
 brief but still memorable comments.

Third, at our Board meeting, we're anticipating two possible topics to disc=
uss informally during lunch.  John: would you be willing, once again, to sh=
are your thoughts about the current state of affairs on the various stumps?=
  And John and Larry:  would you comment on the implications of the Supreme=
 Court's stay of the Clean Power Plan?  I'll chime in with my own two cents=
 after you, but I think it would be really interesting to hear your legal p=
erspective, Larry, and then your policy/political view, John.  I'll be happ=
y to share what I know/hear about from the perspective of states' actions.

Ok, that's it.   Sorry for the long message.
