You going to Truckee on July 4? If yes, mind sharing the condo with my
friend Lauren? She graduated Berkeley Law a few years after you and just
moved back after a stint at the WH.

Thanks, John!  Very kind of you.

Do you know if Gabe plans to use the condo on or around July 4 weekend?  It
might be nice to go up for that weekend and tack a few days on to study
before or after, if it is available?  I've been told that is when the
stress starts to peak, so nature might be helpful.

Hope all is well -

Lauren
