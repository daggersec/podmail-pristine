Dear Partners and Friends,

Our foundation went through a strategic planning process earlier this year =
to assess where we could have the greatest impact on our nation=92s public =
school system in the future.  When we began our work in K-12 education refo=
rm in 1999, we believed that urgent, bold reforms were necessary to transfo=
rm the status quo into a system that produced dramatically higher student a=
chievement.

For more than a decade, the majority of our investments in education philan=
thropy has been in the areas of school district governance, management, lab=
or relations and competition.  We have been proud to invest in organization=
s and leaders that have pursued new ways of tackling the challenges facing =
America=92s public schools.  Our grantees have succeeded in their efforts t=
o redesign school districts, draw top talent into the field, and scale up s=
uccessful alternative delivery models like high-quality public charter scho=
ols.

Although progress has been made, we still have a long way to go before our =
students are internationally competitive in this global economy.  As with a=
ny challenge, we are most interested in looking for the next set of promisi=
ng ideas, institutions and talent.  For the next three years, our foundatio=
n will direct most of our resources toward creating the policies, innovatio=
ns, leadership and institutions under which teachers and students can=96and=
 do=96succeed.  We will be purposeful, yet opportunistic in the following f=
our areas:

Transformative federal and state policy.  We will be expanding our policy w=
ork at the federal and state levels.  President Barack Obama and Secretary =
Arne Duncan have created powerful incentives for states and districts to dr=
amatically improve American public education.  The success of that work dep=
ends on the ability of states to implement courageous, aligned reforms =96 =
with deliberate speed and at scale =96 that enable students to perform at s=
ignificantly higher levels.  We hope to support federal and state policies =
that remove the barriers to effective K-12 education and create the human c=
apital, school choice, resource and governance conditions under which distr=
icts and schools can succeed.  We also plan to help state education agencie=
s themselves become dynamic, performance-oriented organizations that are re=
ady to adopt and implement bold policies.=20

Groundbreaking innovation in teaching and learning.  We are also excited to=
 embark on new investments in innovations that directly serve students and =
teachers.  Technology is a tremendous untapped resource to dramatically inc=
rease student learning.  By redefining =93classrooms=94 as we know them, te=
chnology can serve to individualize the pace, style and model of instructio=
n to meet each and every student=92s needs.  We also look forward to suppor=
ting labor organizations with the courage and vision to radically innovate =
collective bargaining in ways that benefit teachers and students.

Strong leadership.  We are proud that The Broad Center for the Management o=
f School Systems has trained more than 300 executives, the majority of whom=
 are now working in school districts around the country.  Broad Superintend=
ents Academy graduates are raising student achievement faster than their pe=
ers after three years in their positions.  And Broad Residents are freeing =
up millions of dollars for the classroom by introducing central office effi=
ciencies. =20

Redesigned, high-performing institutions.  Finally, redesigned school distr=
icts, high-quality public charter schools, Broad Prize districts and altern=
ative pathways like Teach For America have one thing in common.  They have =
all adopted or created radically different models that demonstrate it is po=
ssible to build high-performing organizations that produce gains for studen=
ts.  We look forward to continuing to support these best-in-class instituti=
ons and to sharing the tools and practices that will make it faster and eas=
ier for new leaders to grow high-performing organizations to scale, without=
 wasting a moment reinventing the wheel.

More than a decade ago, when we decided to turn to philanthropy full-time a=
nd focus our efforts on K-12 public education reform, we were fortunate to =
have the expertise and leadership of Dan Katzir, who helped build our found=
ation=92s education work.  After 11 years leading The Broad Foundation=92s =
education reform work, Dan has decided to change his role to become a part-=
time senior advisor to the foundation.  We will always be grateful to Dan f=
or his leadership, dedication and commitment.  Dan=92s last day as managing=
 director of The Broad Foundation will be Friday, July 23. =20

We are again fortunate to have the strong leadership of two of our senior s=
taff, who will jointly lead our education reform work.  I am pleased that G=
regory McGinity, who has been with our foundation since 2003, will serve as=
 managing director of policy, and Rebecca Wolf DiBiase, who has been a core=
 member of our grants team since 2006, will be managing director of program=
s.  Additionally, we are pleased to announce that Lydia Logan recently join=
ed The Broad Foundation as a senior director.  Lydia previously was vice pr=
esident and executive director of the Institute for a Competitive Workforce=
 at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

As we enter this new chapter in our foundation=92s education work, we are e=
very bit as excited and optimistic as we were when we began in 1999.  We lo=
ok forward to working with you on this next generation of challenges and op=
portunities.
