Just to keep you updated - I reached out to Derek, who was in Berlin. We
had a good email exchange on this and he suggested I talk to Katulis, who
as also at Madeleine's on Tuesday. Brian and I talked and he said that
Sandy also has some ideas in this space and had discussed them with Jake.
Brian, Derek, and I are going to get together next week when Derek is back
in town to see if we can all get on the same page. Seems as if a lot of
folks are thinking about this just now. Thanks for suggesting I reach out
to Derek and I will keep you informed on how our conversations go. Ken
