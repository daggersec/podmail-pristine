To summarize, your position would be that she would be open to reinstating
glass steagall if it came to that?   What's the answer to "what's it gonna
take"?

Look, I wasn't there in the 90s. But I don't think she will win a battle on
glass steagall's role in the crisis. And I think it is problem. Fair or
unfair it's pretty ingrained. So I'm trying to think of a third way between
support and opposition. I think O'Malley will push her to be opposed and it
could be really deadly.

But I'm happy to register my dissent from your views and move on.
