Hey John,

Howdy,

Currently working on a piece about some Tom Perez veepstakes buzz I've heard.

Nothing stupid as I know the process hasn't really begun. Still, I
know a bunch of folks who are excited about him and see him as a
potential pick that could sort of soothe the Warren wing types.

Interested in whether you have any take on him you might want to
share. I hear you're a big fan of his.

Obviously, I know you wouldn't want to go on record with this. Looking
for an anonymous "high-level Clinton staffer" type quote about whether
you like the guy.

Let me know what you think and congrats on a huge weekend. My cell is
917 363 5315.

Hunter
