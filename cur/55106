John --=20

Trying to get Congress to pass good, progressive
legislation isn't easy -- we know that pretty well by
now.=20

That's why this is so important: Right now, Congress is
closer to passing comprehensive immigration reform than
they've been in a generation.

Last Tuesday, a smart, bipartisan bill for comprehensive
immigration reform moved ahead toward a full vote in the
Senate -- and that vote could happen in just a matter of
weeks.=20

If there was ever a time to get off the sidelines, it's now.

Simply add your name and say you'll join our fight for
immigration reform today:

http://my.barackobama.com/Comprehensive-Immigration-Reform

Just as we're going to rail on Congress when they cave to
pressure from special interests and fail the people who
sent them there, we're going to rally behind them when they
start getting things done.

The organizing on the ground, the Days of Action,
the tweets, Facebook posts, and calls to Congress are
working -- but we absolutely can not let up now.

If we fail, it might be years before we get anywhere near
this close again.

Keep going.

Add your name today:

http://my.barackobama.com/Comprehensive-Immigration-Reform

Thank you,

Jon
