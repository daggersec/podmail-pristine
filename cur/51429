John,

Great to hear from you and I'm super excited to get your input for this
piece. I've included the questions in the body of this email below -- any
chance you think you'd be able to get these back to me by the end of the
day today? I can only imagine how busy you are, so if this is impossible,
when do you think I could realistically expect a response (just so I can
let my editor know -- I'm on a rather tight deadline).

Thanks so much in advance and I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,

Daniel



*Why do you think that the disclosure of UFO related documents is
important?*

*It seems like a lot of UFO documents would contain sensitive military
information =E2=80=93 how would you go about getting these released?*


*Do you think if Hillary is elected she would make good on her promise to
get to the bottom of this UFO business? Why?*


*Other than Hillary, are there any other alien-friendly candidates in the
running? If not, why do you think this is?*


*What makes you think there is information on UFO and extraterrestrials
that the government is not sharing with the people? What would the motive
be for this?*


*If it turned out that there was information being withheld, how do you
think people would react to it? Are we ready to hear this? Why/why not?*
