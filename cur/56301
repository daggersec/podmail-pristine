Nancy,

Great article!  I hadn't seen this.

Regarding Perez, we have been making the case that we would be happy if=20
the rules were sent back to DOL under Perez.  He is respected by both=20
labor and disability organizations.  He is knowledgeable about the ADA=20
and community-based services.  He has a history of bringing opposing=20
people together.  But in order for him to resolve this mess, he has to=20
be in a decision-making position, so the proposed rules would need to=20
be sent back to DOL rather than continue forward through the approval=20
process at OMB.

Bruce

Perez just got appointed to DOL We need to talk to him. He's good on
ADA.  How imminent does this make the DOL rules, I wonder? -- nancy
