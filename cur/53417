Dear James,

What do you call a father who doesn't pay child support - Congressman Joe
Walsh.

Today I read a startling news report that Congressman Joe Walsh is being
sued by the mother of his children for failing to pay court mandated child
support. Rep. Walsh claimed he couldn't pay his child support because he wa=
s
unemployed =96 but during this same time he somehow found a way to loan his
campaign $35,000.

I want Congressman Walsh to know that people in his district want a
representative who honors their financial obligations, especially when they
involve children.

*Will you join me for an impromptu protest outside of Rep. Joe Walsh's Fox
Lake congressional office this Saturday morning at 9:00 AM? Click here to
RSVP.<http://www.catholics-united.org/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.=
php?u=3D1191&qid=3D95568623>
*

We need to send Rep. Joe Walsh a message that his constituents will not
tolerate this type of irresponsible behavior. And if we can get enough
people to join us Saturday morning, there is a strong possibility the press
will join us to see what we have to say. But in order to make sure the pres=
s
shows up, we need to get at least 15 people to join us. We'll provide the
signs if you can help provide the people.

*Will you RSVP for this impromptu protest and forward this invite on to 15
of your friends and family
members?<http://www.catholics-united.org/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/u=
rl.php?u=3D1191&qid=3D95568623>
*

During his short term in office, Rep. Joe Walsh has proven himself to be an
outspoken leader of the Tea Party. We've known him to be a brash individual
with a bullying 'no-compromise' personality in Congress. But what we didn't
know was that his bullying 'no-compromise' style also extended to his
treatment of his former wife and children. Let's send Rep. Walsh a message
that voters don't approve of this behavior, *RSVP for the protest by
