AFL-CIO Mailer Touts Obama on Guns, Jobs (click link to view mailer)
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/14/afl-cio-mailer-touts-obam_n_134472=
.html=20

The AFL-CIO is blasting out a new mailer to its members, trumpeting Barack =
Obama's credentials on a key issue of the day -- job creation -- and a pote=
ntial perceived weakness, gun control.

The mailer quotes Mike Day, a union member, declaring: "I want to protect t=
wo things: my job and my gun. That's why I'm supporting Barack Obama." It a=
lso touts Obama's tax cuts for the middle class and his support for the Emp=
loyee Free Choice Act, a top legislative priority for the labor movement. J=
ohn McCain isn't mentioned.
The new communications blitz is aimed at a "microtargeted group of the hard=
est to reach union household voters -- gun owners, veterans and retirees," =
AFL-CIO spokesman Steve Smith said.
The mailer will begin arriving on Tuesday at the homes of 80,000 swing vote=
rs and gun owners in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It follows an eight-=
state mailing last week to veterans hammering McCain's record on veterans' =
health care.
