::: ProgressNow - Advancing Progressive Agendas, State by State :::=20



Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Below are a few great examples of how we are bringing our fight for
progressive values to the ballot box. From the recall election in
Colorado to the upcoming off-year election and future general
elections, we have already started working hard to support progressive
candidates and ensure that voters have the information they need to
make informed decisions. =A0These are just three of our 21 states
doing what we do every day - make progress happen, and happen
NOW.

As always, let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to
us here.

ProgressNow Colorado Fights Unnecessary Recall Election

Voters in Colorado are heading to the ballot box one month early this
year. With the help of the NRA, Americans for Prosperity, and the Koch
Brothers, a small group of extreme conservatives in Colorado have
funded a recall election on Senate President John Morse and Senator
Angela Giron. Proponents of the recalls are attempting this for one
simple reason: these state Senators voted in a way that they didn't
like. It's not a coincidence that the recall petition against
Senators Morse and Giron came shortly after their vote for background
checks and limits on high capacity magazines. As a result, extremists
are funneling money and lies into this election as an attempt to
punish good legislators.

http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DAUt7AYSJlZk33YTxKKBGcA

ProgressNow Colorado is working hard to fight the recall and keep
Senator Morse and Giron in office. They are connecting with voters in
Colorado Springs and Pueblo to encourage them to vote NO. ProgressNow
Colorado is making sure that voters are aware of the recall election
by spreading the word on Facebook and Twitter. By contributing to
ProgressNow Colorado, or the Senators campaigns directly, you can help
ensure that they have the resources they need to inform voters about
the upcoming election and help keep dedicated progressives in office.
The only way to keep these costly and unnecessary recall elections
from becoming the norm is to stop them cold right here.

Fuse Washington Highlights Key Races for the 2013 Election

Even though Washington's 2nd special session has finally come to
a close, Fuse Washington 's work is far from over. Each year
Fuse releases a Progressive Donor Guide highlighting the most
important and most competitive races in Washington state.=A0 Their
Guide provides donors with information about how to support good
progressives in close races, where their contributions will definitely
make a difference. Fuse just released a preview of their 2013 guide,
focusing on the five races they already know will be the most
important in the 2013 election. While they will be adding more races
and information after the primary, Fuse wanted to highlight the top
races for early money.=A0
http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DpIVlPMAmUniDIlqZ5rFCQA

Progressive Donor Guides
Washington's top race this fall -- a "Must Give" in
the Guide -- is the special election for state Senator Nathan
Schlicher. Senator Schlicher was appointed to fill the open seat in
the 26th District this past January, and in order to hold the seat he
needs to beat far-right conservative Representative Jan Angel. This
race is particularly important because it represents a fork in the
road for progress. By re-electing Sen. Schlicher, progressives can go
on the offense in 2014 to not just retake a Democratic majority in the
Senate, but also build a working majority. Help the progressive fight
in Washington State and consider making a contribution to Senator
Nathan Schlicher today.

Better Georgia Prepares to Fight for Progressive Change in 2014

For a decade, conservative leaders have controlled Georgia politics.
These politicians have repeatedly made decisions to side with
corporations and wealthy right-wing conservatives rather than their
constituents. Fortunately, the tide is turning and Georgia is on its
way to becoming more progressive. Better Georgia is preparing now for
the 2014 elections because they know it's imperative to elect
progressive candidates. One such candidate is Michelle Nunn who
announced her candidacy for Senate just last week. Better Georgia
knows that the attacks against Nunn will be relentless and they're
ready to keep conservatives honest. In fact, they have already begun.

http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DsHrvz_gWjojgxhNmPyYOyw

Better Georgia 2014 Decal
That is why Better Georgia is fighting for a fair, issue-focused
Senate race. Instead of relying on baseless attacks, voters should
have the information they need to make informed decisions about the
candidates. By supporting Better Georgia, you can help ensure they
have the resources they need to educate voters about progressive
candidates such as Michelle Nunn and their true stance on
issues.=A0 If you donate today, you can even get a 2014 decal to
show that you are ready for a change. It's important for all of
us to stand up for progressive values in a state that has been
dominated by conservative leaders and policies for far too long. Take
a stand.
