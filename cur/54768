Flashback (VIDEO): In 2009, Scott Brown Said The Senate Health Bill 'Mirror=
s' The Massachusetts Plan He Supports<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/02/04/b=
rown-support-senatehealth/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2010/02/04/brown-support-senatehealth/

Later this afternoon, Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) will expedite the process and =
seat Scott Brown (R-MA) as the next Senator from Massachusetts. In the last=
 three months of his campaign, Brown attacked health reform efforts by larg=
ely misrepresenting the bills in Congress. Brown, who supports the Massachu=
setts universal health system, caustically sneered at national efforts to r=
eplicate their success. "Why would we go and subsidize the failure<http://w=
onkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/01/21/brown-federal-money/> of other states?=
" Of course, Brown never mentioned that the Massachusetts system, which he =
voted for, is funded by $385 million<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010=
/01/21/brown-federal-money/> in annual payments through the federal governm=
ent.

Now, Brown is coming to the Senate promising to kill health reform. He reit=
erated this promise last Sunday, telling ABC's This Week that legislators s=
hould scrap current legislation and "go back to the drawing board<http://ww=
w.politico.com/news/stories/0210/32295.html>."

But late last summer, before it was politically advantageous to capitalize =
on health reform misinformation, Brown actually endorsed the Senate bill he=
 now wants to kill. In an interview with MSNBC's Dylan Ratigan, Brown state=
d that the Senate health bill was "really mirroring" the "really great" Mas=
sachusetts health plan:

BROWN: Well it's been interesting looking at the Senate and the US Senate i=
s doing. They're really mirroring what we did a couple of years ago through=
 Governor Romney's leadership. We had a bipartisan plan that was carefully =
crafted to make sure that everybody's interests were taken into considerati=
on: business, providers, individuals and obviously the Commonwealth. And as=
 I said we have a plan that is somewhat similar to what the Federal plan [.=
..] Without the Federal stimulus dollars and the waiver money filling our p=
lan, it would fail. And you have a really great plan, we've gone from 10% u=
ninsured to really 2.6 million people uninsured, er, 2.6% people uninsured.=
 So it's worked, but it also has its failures.

Watch it:

In the clip, Brown admits that the Massachusetts plan is buoyed by federal =
money. As the Wonk Room has reported<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010=
/01/25/brown-fed-money/>, before the campaign heated up, Brown frequently b=
ragged about relying on federal money and even floated support for the publ=
ic option for other states. The health bill passed by the Senate would not =
penalize Massachusetts' special funds. In fact, Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) has =
ensured that the Brown-backed Massachusetts system would become truly susta=
inable through "roughly $500 million<http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/hull_blog=
/?p=3D31974>" in expanded Medicaid funds for the Bay State.

The House-requested changes to the Senate bill, which can be passed at any =
point right now through reconciliation, would take out the subsidies to Neb=
raska that Brown has complained loudly about. Of course, for political reas=
ons, Brown will still probably try to vote against reform. But he is doing =
so out of loyalty to his party, and certainly not by his own convictions th=
at he spelled out so clearly last year. If the Senate bill is signed into l=
aw, Brown and his GOP allies fear that the country will act like Massachuse=
tts - where an astounding 79%<http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/20=
09/09/28/support_for_mass_health_insurance_overhaul_drops_but_is_still_stro=
ng/?page=3D2> of people support the healthcare system and millions of previ=
ously uninsured people now have health care.
