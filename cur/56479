Anti-Lobbyist Candidate Is Advised by Lobbyists

By Michael D. Shear and Jeffrey H. Birnbaum
Washington Post Staff Writers
Friday, February 22, 2008; A01

For years, Sen. John McCain
<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/m000303/>  (R-Ariz.)
has railed against lobbyists and the influence of "special interests" in
Washington, touting on his campaign Web site his fight against "the
'revolving door' by which lawmakers and other influential officials leave
their posts and become lobbyists for the special interests they have aided."

But when McCain huddled with his closest advisers at his rustic Arizona
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Arizona?tid=informline>
cabin last weekend to map out his presidential campaign, virtually every one
was part of the Washington lobbying culture he has long decried. His
campaign manager, Rick Davis
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rick+Davis?tid=informline>
, co-founded a lobbying firm whose clients have included Verizon
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Verizon+Communications+Inc.
?tid=informline>  and SBC Telecommunications. His chief political adviser,
Charles R. Black Jr., is chairman of one of Washington's lobbying
powerhouses, BKSH and Associates, which has represented AT&T, Alcoa
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Alcoa+Inc.?tid=informline>
, JP Morgan and U.S. Airways
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/US+Airways+Group+Inc.?tid=i
nformline> .

Senior advisers Steve Schmidt and Mark McKinnon
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mark+McKinnon?tid=informlin
e>  work for firms that have lobbied for Land O Lakes, the UST Public
Affairs, Dell
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Dell+Inc.?tid=informline>
and Fannie Mae
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Fannie+Mae?tid=informline>
.

McCain's relationship with lobbyists became an issue this week after it was
reported that his aides asked Vicki Iseman
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Vicki+Iseman?tid=informline
> , a telecom lobbyist, to distance herself from his 2000 presidential
campaign because it would threaten McCain's reputation for independence. An
angry and defiant McCain denounced the stories yesterday, declaring: "At no
time have I ever done anything that would betray the public trust."

Even before McCain finished his news conference, uber-lobbyist Black made
the rounds of television networks to defend McCain against charges that he
has been tainted by his relationship with a lobbyist. Black's current
clients include General Motors
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/General+Motors+Corporation?
tid=informline> , United Technologies
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/United+Technologies+Corpora
tion?tid=informline> , J.P. Morgan and AT&T.

Black said he is still being paid by his firm and does work for clients in
his "spare time," recusing himself from lobbying McCain: "I not only do not
lobby him [McCain], but if an issue comes up that I have a client on, I will
tell him that and stay out of the discussion."

A common career path for political operatives is a lucrative job at a
Washington lobbying firm that allows them to continue campaign work, and
McCain is hardly the first candidate to draw on that talent pool. The
campaign of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001041/>  (D-N.Y.) has
been aided by lobbyists Harold Ickes
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Harold+Ickes?tid=informline
>  and Mark Penn
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mark+Penn?tid=informline> ,
who heads Burson Marsteller
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Burson-Marsteller+Ltd.?tid=
informline>  Worldwide. Sen. Barack Obama
<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/o000167/>  (D-Ill.) has
been advised by former senator Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), who does not
register to lobby but advises clients about Washington.

In McCain's case, the fact that lobbyists are essentially running his
presidential campaign -- most of them as volunteers -- seems to some people
to be at odds with his anti-lobbying rhetoric. "He has a closer relationship
with lobbyists than he lets on," said Melanie Sloan
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Melanie+Sloan?tid=informlin
e>  of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Citizens+for+Responsibility
+and+Ethics+in+Washington?tid=informline> . "The problem for McCain being so
closely associated with lobbyists is that he's the candidate most closely
associated with attacking lobbyists."

Davis did not respond to requests for an interview. Black, acting as a
campaign spokesman, said that Davis is being paid neither by his firm nor by
the McCain campaign, and has not been a registered lobbyist for three years.

Schmidt and McKinnon said they remain with their firms, but are not
lobbyists and have recused themselves from the issues of their clients in
the McCain campaign. "I've never discussed a client issue with the candidate
or his staff," McKinnon wrote in an e-mail.

Campaign finance experts said employees of a company are allowed to
volunteer for a campaign as long as they do so on their own time, or
continue to perform the functions for which their employers are paying them.

McCain's reliance on lobbyists for key jobs -- both in the Senate and in his
presidential campaign -- extends beyond his inner circle.

McCain recently hired Mark Buse to be his Senate chief of staff. Buse led
the Commerce Committee staff in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and was
until last fall a lobbyist for ML Strategies, representing EBay, Goldman
Sachs Group
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Goldman+Sachs+Group+Inc.?ti
d=informline> , Cablevision
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Cablevision+Systems+Corpora
tion?tid=informline> , Tenneco and Novartis Pharmaceuticals
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Novartis+AG?tid=informline>
.

McCain's top fundraising official is former congressman Tom Loeffler
(R-Tex.), who heads a lobbying law firm called the Loeffler Group. He has
counseled the Saudis as well as Southwest Airlines
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Southwest+Airlines+Inc.?tid
=informline> , AT&T, Toyota
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Toyota+Motor+Corporation?ti
d=informline>  and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.

Public Citizen
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Public+Citizen+Foundation?t
id=informline> , a group that monitors campaign fundraising, has found that
McCain had more bundlers -- people who gather checks from networks of
friends and associates -- from the lobbying community than any other
presidential candidate from either party.

By the group's current count, McCain had at least 59 federal lobbyists
raising money for his campaign, compared with 33 working for Republican
Rudolph W. Giuliani
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rudolph+Giuliani?tid=inform
line>  and 19 working for Democrat Clinton.

"The potential harm is that should Senator McCain become elected, those
people will have a very close relationship with the McCain White House
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+White+House?tid=informl
ine> ," Sloan said. "[That] would be very helpful for their clients, and
that would give them a leg up on everybody else."

Of all the lobbyists involved in the McCain campaign, the most prominent is
Black, who has made a lucrative career of shuttling back and forth between
presidential politics and big-time Washington lobbying. He has worked for
the campaigns of former congressman Jack Kemp
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Jack+Kemp?tid=informline>
(N.Y.), former president George H.W. Bush
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/George+H.W.+Bush?tid=inform
line>  and former senators Phil Gramm
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Phil+Gramm?tid=informline>
(Tex. <http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Texas?tid=informline>
) and Robert J. Dole
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Robert+J.+Dole?tid=informli
ne>  (Kan.
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Kansas?tid=informline> ),
all Republicans.

"I've spent a fair amount of my life as a lobbyist, but I've spent a
majority of my adult life running Republican political campaigns," Black,
60, said.

His relationship with McCain, for whom he is a senior adviser, goes back 30
years, from the time McCain first came to Washington. They got to know each
other well during Gramm's 1996 presidential run; Gramm, now an investment
banker, now is a major supporter and adviser to McCain.

But even as Black provide a private voice and a public face for McCain, he
also leads his lobbying firm, which offers corporate interests and foreign
governments the promise of access to the most powerful lawmakers. Some of
those companies have interests before the Senate and, in particular,
McCain's Commerce Committee.

Black said he does a lot of his work by telephone from McCain's Straight
Talk Express bus.

He said, however, the combination now requires that he work on weekends,
which means 80- or even 90-hour weeks. If McCain were to ask him to step up
his commitment to the campaign during the general election, Black said he
would take a leave or a reduced salary from BKSH and devote himself to
electing McCain president.

McCain has long sought to defend his associations with lobbyists, stressing
that friendships with them do not influence his independent judgment when it
comes to legislative action. In comments to reporters yesterday, he
acknowledged those friendships.

"I have many friends who represent various interests, ranging from the
firemen to the police to senior citizens to various interests, particularly
before my committee," McCain said. "The question is . . . do they have
excess or unwarranted influence? And certainly no one ever has in my conduct
of my public life and conduct of my legislative agenda."

Advised by Lobbyists</span></b><o:p></o:p></p>

<p>For years, <a
href=3D"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/m000303/"
target=3D"_blank">Sen. John McCain</a> (R-Ariz.) has railed against =
lobbyists and
the influence of &quot;special interests&quot; in Washington, touting on =
his
campaign Web site his fight against &quot;the 'revolving door' by which
lawmakers and other influential officials leave their posts and become
lobbyists for the special interests they have =
aided.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>But when McCain huddled with his closest advisers at his rustic <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Arizona?tid=3Dinf=
ormline"
target=3D"_blank">Arizona</a> cabin last weekend to map out his =
presidential
campaign, virtually every one was part of the Washington lobbying =
culture he
has long decried. His campaign manager, <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rick+Davis?tid=3D=
informline"
target=3D"_blank">Rick Davis</a>, co-founded a lobbying firm whose =
clients have
included <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Verizon+Communica=
tions+Inc.?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Verizon</a> and SBC Telecommunications. His chief =
political adviser,
Charles R. Black Jr., is chairman of one of Washington's lobbying =
powerhouses,
BKSH and Associates, which has represented AT&amp;T, <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Alcoa+Inc.?tid=3D=

target=3D"_blank">Alcoa</a>, JP Morgan and <a

<p>Senior advisers Steve Schmidt and <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mark+McKinnon?tid=
=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Mark McKinnon</a> work for firms that have lobbied for =

Lakes, the UST Public Affairs, <a

informline"

<p>McCain's relationship with lobbyists became an issue this week after =
it was
reported that his aides asked <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Vicki+Iseman?tid=3D=
informline"
target=3D"_blank">Vicki Iseman</a>, a telecom lobbyist, to distance =
herself from
his 2000 presidential campaign because it would threaten McCain's =
reputation
for independence. An angry and defiant McCain denounced the stories =
yesterday,
declaring: &quot;At no time have I ever done anything that would betray =
the
public trust.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Even before McCain finished his news conference, uber-lobbyist Black =
made
the rounds of television networks to defend McCain against charges that =
he has
been tainted by his relationship with a lobbyist. Black's current =
clients
include <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/General+Motors+Co=
rporation?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">General Motors</a>, <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/United+Technologi=
es+Corporation?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">United Technologies</a>, J.P. Morgan and =
AT&amp;T.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Black said he is still being paid by his firm and does work for =
clients in
his &quot;spare time,&quot; recusing himself from lobbying McCain: =
&quot;I not
only do not lobby him [McCain], but if an issue comes up that I have a =
client
on, I will tell him that and stay out of the =
discussion.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>A common career path for political operatives is a lucrative job at a
Washington lobbying firm that allows them to continue campaign work, and =
McCain
is hardly the first candidate to draw on that talent pool. The campaign =
of <a
href=3D"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001041/"
target=3D"_blank">Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> (D-N.Y.) has been =
aided by
lobbyists <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Harold+Ickes?tid=3D=
informline"
target=3D"_blank">Harold Ickes</a> and <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mark+Penn?tid=3Di=
nformline"
target=3D"_blank">Mark Penn</a>, who heads <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Burson-Marsteller=
+Ltd.?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Burson Marsteller</a> Worldwide. <a
href=3D"http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/o000167/"
target=3D"_blank">Sen. Barack Obama</a> (D-Ill.) has been advised by =
former
senator Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), who does not register to lobby but =
advises
clients about Washington.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>In McCain's case, the fact that lobbyists are essentially running his
presidential campaign -- most of them as volunteers -- seems to some =
people to
be at odds with his anti-lobbying rhetoric. &quot;He has a closer =
relationship
with lobbyists than he lets on,&quot; said <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Melanie+Sloan?tid=
=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Melanie Sloan</a> of <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Citizens+for+Resp=
onsibility+and+Ethics+in+Washington?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in =
Washington</a>.
&quot;The problem for McCain being so closely associated with lobbyists =
is that
he's the candidate most closely associated with attacking =
lobbyists.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Davis did not respond to requests for an interview. Black, acting as =
a
campaign spokesman, said that Davis is being paid neither by his firm =
nor by
the McCain campaign, and has not been a registered lobbyist for three =
years.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Schmidt and McKinnon said they remain with their firms, but are not
lobbyists and have recused themselves from the issues of their clients =
in the
McCain campaign. &quot;I've never discussed a client issue with the =
candidate
or his staff,&quot; McKinnon wrote in an e-mail.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Campaign finance experts said employees of a company are allowed to
volunteer for a campaign as long as they do so on their own time, or =
continue
to perform the functions for which their employers are paying =
them.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>McCain's reliance on lobbyists for key jobs -- both in the Senate and =
in his
presidential campaign -- extends beyond his inner circle.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>McCain recently hired Mark Buse to be his Senate chief of staff. Buse =
led
the Commerce Committee staff in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and was =
until
last fall a lobbyist for ML Strategies, representing EBay, <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Goldman+Sachs+Gro=
up+Inc.?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Goldman Sachs Group</a>, <a

href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Novartis+AG?tid=3D=
informline"
target=3D"_blank">Novartis Pharmaceuticals</a>.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>McCain's top fundraising official is former congressman Tom Loeffler
(R-Tex.), who heads a lobbying law firm called the Loeffler Group. He =
has
counseled the Saudis as well as <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Southwest+Airline=
s+Inc.?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Southwest Airlines</a>, AT&amp;T, <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Toyota+Motor+Corp=
oration?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Toyota</a> and the Pharmaceutical Research and =
Manufacturers of
America.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p><a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Public+Citizen+Fo=
undation?tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Public Citizen</a>, a group that monitors campaign =
fundraising,
has found that McCain had more bundlers -- people who gather checks from
networks of friends and associates -- from the lobbying community than =
any
other presidential candidate from either party.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>By the group's current count, McCain had at least 59 federal =
lobbyists
raising money for his campaign, compared with 33 working for <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rudolph+Giuliani?=
tid=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">Republican Rudolph W. Giuliani</a> and 19 working for =
Democrat
Clinton.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>&quot;The potential harm is that should Senator McCain become =
elected, those
people will have a very close relationship with the McCain <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+White+House?t=
id=3Dinformline"
target=3D"_blank">White House</a>,&quot; Sloan said. &quot;[That] would =
be very
helpful for their clients, and that would give them a leg up on =
everybody
else.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Of all the lobbyists involved in the McCain campaign, the most =
prominent is
Black, who has made a lucrative career of shuttling back and forth =
between
presidential politics and big-time Washington lobbying. He has worked =
for the
campaigns of former congressman <a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Jack+Kemp?tid=3Di=
nformline"
target=3D"_blank">Jack Kemp</a> (N.Y.), former president <a

target=3D"_blank">Phil Gramm</a> (<a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Texas?tid=3Dinfor=

target=3D"_blank">Robert J. Dole</a> (<a
href=3D"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Kansas?tid=3Dinfo=
rmline"
target=3D"_blank">Kan.</a>), all Republicans.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>&quot;I've spent a fair amount of my life as a lobbyist, but I've =
spent a
majority of my adult life running Republican political campaigns,&quot; =
Black,
60, said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>His relationship with McCain, for whom he is a senior adviser, goes =
back 30
years, from the time McCain first came to Washington. They got to know =
each
other well during Gramm's 1996 presidential run; Gramm, now an =
investment
banker, now is a major supporter and adviser to McCain.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>But even as Black provide a private voice and a public face for =
McCain, he
also leads his lobbying firm, which offers corporate interests and =
foreign
governments the promise of access to the most powerful lawmakers. Some =
of those
companies have interests before the Senate and, in particular, McCain's
Commerce Committee.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>Black said he does a lot of his work by telephone from McCain's =
Straight
Talk Express bus.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>He said, however, the combination now requires that he work on =
weekends,
which means 80- or even 90-hour weeks. If McCain were to ask him to step =
up his
commitment to the campaign during the general election, Black said he =
would
take a leave or a reduced salary from BKSH and devote himself to =
electing
McCain president.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>McCain has long sought to defend his associations with lobbyists, =
stressing
that friendships with them do not influence his independent judgment =
when it
comes to legislative action. In comments to reporters yesterday, he
acknowledged those friendships.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p>&quot;I have many friends who represent various interests, ranging =
from the
firemen to the police to senior citizens to various interests, =
particularly
before my committee,&quot; McCain said. &quot;The question is . . . do =
they
have excess or unwarranted influence? And certainly no one ever has in =
my
conduct of my public life and conduct of my legislative =
agenda.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>
