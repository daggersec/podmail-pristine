John,
We hope and trust all is well. 
Just to let you know, our New Jersey political deliberations continue, quietly and intently. We have begun to hire advisers. As there is no sense as to when the election will be (impeached? Resign to run for president? Neither?), we are likely to establish a policy-oriented c4 aimed at growing the NJ economy from $500 to $600 billion in 5 years. We are hoping that a platform like this will give us visibility, credentials, etc. Not only are we consulting top thinkers in NJ but are trying to vacuum up ideas from elsewhere (Neera and team are graciously hosting me for a brainstorming in early April. All in all, I would describe us as "VERY serious but not yet committed."
Would love to talk sometime. 
Miss you. Best to Mary and team. PM
