Our summer TRIPLE MATCH offer is under way - don't miss out! Make your gift=

John,

700 people -- in just two days. Fantastic! Even I couldn't have guessed how=
 fired up our supporters would be this summer. So many folks have told us t=
hey're ready to stand up and fight for the environment -- will you be one o=
f them? http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Dkr0G097Zh2u-BDjYQU293w

We've never run a campaign like this before -- but then again, we've never =
seen stakes this high. If you haven't had a chance to join us yet, read on =
for a few reasons why your generous gift is absolutely critical.

Reason #1: Because it's freaking hot outside. Right now, the U.S. is in the=
 middle of one of the worst heat waves in recorded history. And if we don't=
 take bold, immediate action against climate change, it's only going to get=
 hotter. Give now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DRT5-UMx5x2WXl88SDCXElw =
.

Reason #2: Because we just had a huge victory yesterday when the Senate con=
firmed clean air champion Gina McCarthy as the new head of EPA. We won beca=
use our members kept the pressure on their senators for 136 days. Imagine w=
hat we can do with a stronger membership base and even more resources. Give=
 now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D3CXsTvlRjGk1WKBU-69lwQ .

Reason #3: Because the tea party is angling for a major comeback this summe=
r. If they can get a foothold in the next few weeks, they'll be a huge (and=
 dangerous) player in the 2014 elections, and stand in the way of any movem=
ent on climate change. We've got to stop them now, before they get any stro=
nger. Give now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DwrY-OL409TZYHc4s_OEkJQ .

Reason #4: Because a decision on the dirty Keystone XL pipeline is expected=
 by the end of year -- and Big Oil is doing everything they can to get the =
green light. This is our very last chance to stop a climate catastrophe bef=
ore it's too late. Give now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DqGdgxjtmtlnZ0=
jFntlL8ug .

Reason #5: Because members of Congress are about to head home to their dist=
ricts, which means our voices must be the loudest. We've got the plans, the=
 passion and the determination -- but we still need the funds to make it al=
l happen. Give now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DDWagKj5V5Gw6aeBSq9jeaA=
 .

Reason #6: Because until July 31, every single dollar you give will be TRIP=
LED. $25 becomes $75. $100 becomes $300. It's your chance to TRIPLE your im=
pact for the environment -- don't pass it up! Give now: http://action.lcv.o=
rg/site/R?i=3Do1m_muY79GwgwSzvLZ8pVA .

Everyone's got a reason to care about the environment -- and whatever yours=
 is, I hope it inspires you to support LCV today. Don't wait -- make your g=
ift right now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DD8nIAiM_uBtfUm99Jab0mg .

Thanks for your support.

Sincerely,

Gene
