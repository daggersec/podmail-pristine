Thanks. Actually, I'm the one who recruited Allan Smith to contribute. I kno=
w Tony and Kathy, so I will invite them as well as some other potential dono=
rs.

I'm leaving now for San Francisco so will be out of pocket until late tonigh=
t. Will send out the invitations over the weekend. It's rather short notice,=
 but I hope we can get a good group together for Neera.

 at private homes - then each household resident is able to spend up to $1,0=

I would like some technical advice on setting this up, e.g., is it permissib=
