Alvin Brown, Mitt Romney, and Lenny CurryHide<br>
The First Coast is on former Gov. Mitt Romney&#39;s, R-Mass., mind this wee=
k as he gets involved in the Jacksonville mayoral race and receives an hono=
rary degree from Jacksonville University (JU).<br>
<br>
On Tuesday, Romney endorsed former Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) Chair=
man Lenny Curry in the runoff next month against Jacksonville Mayor Alvin B=
rown. Curry led the RPOF in the 2012 elections when Romney was the Republic=
an candidate against President Barack Obama.<br>
=E2=80=9CI have traveled our country working to advance conservative princi=
ples, and here in Florida I=E2=80=99ve had a partner in Lenny Curry,=E2=80=
=9D Romney said on Tuesday. =E2=80=9CLenny is committed to restoring conser=
vative leadership to Jacksonville. As an accountant and business owner, his=
 professional experiences make him the right person to deal with the city=
=E2=80=99s finances. Lenny and his wife Molly have dedicated themselves to =
making Jacksonville a better place for their children and all families. I p=
roudly support Lenny Curry, and ask all of Jacksonville to vote Lenny Curry=
 for mayor.=E2=80=9D<br>
=E2=80=9CMitt Romney is a conservative leader with a passion to see America=
 succeed,=E2=80=9D Curry said. =E2=80=9CIn business and in public service, =
Gov. Romney has been a tireless advocate for freedom and prosperity. I am h=
onored to have his support and endorsement, and I thank him for taking time=
 to remind voters that conservative principles are the pathway to a better =
Jacksonville.=E2=80=9D<br>
Romney will be the headliner for a fundraiser for Curry on Friday. Leading =
Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., a possible U.S. Sena=
te candidate in 2016; former Florida House Speaker Will Weatherford; former=
 Jacksonville Mayor John Peyton and businessman Wayne Weaver, who brought t=
he National Football League (NFL) to the First Coast as the first owner of =
the Jacksonville Jaguars, are also hosting the fundraiser.<br>
The Curry team also sent out a fundraising email from Romney this week in w=
hich the former presidential candidate connected Brown to national Democrat=
s including former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the favorite fo=
r her party=E2=80=99s presidential nomination next year. Brown is the first=
 Democrat to hold the mayoral office since Ed Austin who was elected in 199=
1.<br>
Brown=E2=80=99s team struck back as Yianni Varonis, a spokesman for the Jac=
ksonville Democrat, went on the attack when he talked to the Florida Times-=
Union.&lt;<a href=3D"http://jacksonville.com/opinion/blog/403455/nate-monro=

&quot;It&#39;s little surprise that a candidate who was infamous for being =
out of touch with working families would stump for the equally out of touch=
 Lenny Curry,&quot; Varonis told the Times-Union. &quot;While Mayor Brown h=
as spent four years working across the aisle to create 36,000 new jobs and =
not raise taxes, Lenny Curry has opposed all efforts to close the gender wa=
ge gap and other measures that would create economic opportunity for all Ja=
cksonville citizens -- and not just the richest few.&quot;<br>
Romney, who announced earlier this year that he would not make another try =
at the presidency, will give the commencement address and receive an honora=
ry degree at JU&#39;s graduation ceremony on Saturday. Over the years, JU h=
