John --

Eighteen years ago, shortly after graduating from law school, I helped =
lead a voter registration campaign in Chicago that generated record =
turnout on Election Day.

That experience taught me one of the most important lessons I ever learned =
as a community organizer: When people promise that they'll do something -- =
like voting -- they are far more likely to do it.

That's why one key part of our Vote 2010 plan this year is to get folks =
like you from across the country to commit to vote, to make sure we get as =
many people as we can to cast their ballots this fall.

But getting the commitments we need starts with your own promise to make =
it to the polls and cast your ballot.

Will you please commit to vote in the 2010 elections?

http://my.barackobama.com/Commitment6

Over the next 82 days, volunteers across the country will spend countless =
hours calling voters and knocking on their doors, asking them the same =
question.

And you can bet that I am counting on you to join them in talking to =
voters in your community.

This election offers a stark choice. We Democrats are hard at work trying =
to move America forward, repairing a decade of damage and growing an =
economy based on the Main Street values of hard work and responsibility.

We've fought for and won historic reforms to our health care system, a =
victory 100 years in the making, and to Wall Street, the most sweeping =
overhaul of the financial system since the Great Depression.

But after years of policies that landed us in the worst recession since =
the 1930's, the Republicans who got us there have not come up with =
anything different from the policies of George W. Bush.

We simply cannot afford to go backwards or let them repeal our reforms. =
And making sure we can continue moving forward starts with your own =
promise to cast your ballot in these elections.

Please commit to vote this fall:

http://my.barackobama.com/Commitment6

Thank you,

President Barack Obama
