Friend,

Wow, they really did it.

Moments ago, the Republican Party of Virginia officially
nominated Ken Cuccinelli as their candidate for Governor.

We knew this was coming, but I want to make sure you know
what it means.

If Ken Cuccinelli is elected Governor, he'll spend the next
four years pushing his divisive social agenda instead of
focusing on what's critically important for Virginia right
now: creating jobs and building our economy.

Will you donate $5 right now to support my campaign?

https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/page/contribute/donate?source=3D20130518=
_email_nomination_a&amp;utm_medium=3Demail&amp;utm_source=3Dmcauliffe&amp;=
utm_campaign=3D20130518_nomination_a

Ken Cuccinelli's been clear about his vision for Virginia --
he wants to roll back gay rights, limit women's access to
health care, and spend your tax dollars trying to
delegitimize climate science.

Republicans at the convention weren't just okay with that
extreme vision -- they rallied behind it. And Cuccinelli's
deep-pocketed allies are pouring money into his campaign to
make it a reality.

I know that when people learn what living in Cuccinelli's
Virginia would really be like, they'll understand the
importance of this election. But I need your help to get
that message out.

If you can't imagine living in Cuccinelli's Virginia, donate
$5 right now to support my campaign:
