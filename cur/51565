I passed by the Parkway Theatre -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?JenniferPaeforOaklan/d1d08b9ee8/08a29c1973/ab95e1ec=
29  on my way to knock on doors in the neighborhood last week. It is
empty now, standing there as if relic from the past. The marquee no
longer shows the upcoming films being featured and the lights are no
longer shining like it used to.

It struck me with sadness. I had spent numerous nights going to the
Parkway with friends and the week leading into the last film showing,
I joined the "I Like The Parkway" community group which has since
been trying to re-open the iconic theatre. The Parkway Theatre had
been there for years serving the local community. The lights would
shine on the streets keeping it safe and the theatre would drive
customers to nearby neighborhood businesses.

As I walked up Park Blvd, I stopped by Rooz Cafe -
http://cts.vresp.com/c/?JenniferPaeforOaklan/d1d08b9ee8/08a29c1973/d372a24f=
40  to grab a drink. Steve was there, the Oaklander owner of Rooz Cafe.
He too had seen a change in the neighborhood around Rooz Cafe since
the Parkway Theatre closed.

"Nobody wants to come to that area. No one has a reason to come to
that area," said Steve. "Ever since the Parkway Theatre has been
closed, we don't see the traffic like we used to."

It is frustrating that the state of Oakland has reached a point where
a neighborhood staple was allowed to shut their doors. City Hall
should have been more supportive of a space like the Parkway Theatre.
As a community we can't let our local businesses close, nor can we
let businesses like Rooz Cafe suffer. We must invest in Oakland and
support our local economy. We need to support business owners like
Steve.

To hear what else Steve has to say, visit our YouTube account for an
interview with him and other members of the Oakland community. -
