John --

If it were easy to do the big, meaningful things we believe will make our =
country better -- if it were quick -- someone would have done those things =
long before any of us showed up.

We've chosen to do something hard.

You know that our victories so far have been hard won: taking the =
difficult steps necessary to put our economy back on track, reforming Wall =
Street excess despite an army of lobbyists against us, and making health =
care more affordable and accessible despite well-organized opposition by =
those who profit from the status quo.

You also know we have not yet done everything we set out to do -- not =
nearly.

But that's a reason to work harder, not to let up. That's why we're =
building this campaign now. And you have to take ownership of it.

So I will be direct: Can you step up and make a donation of $5 to get us =
started?

https://donate.barackobama.com/Begin-Again13

We've had the chance to make historic changes that touch every American: =
from passing a law that says women should get an equal day's pay for an =
equal day's work to removing 100,000 troops from Iraq.

Those things and every other important change we've made happened because =
people like you built an organization to win an election in 2008.

The stakes are even higher this time.

As I've spoken with supporters who are helping get this campaign started, =
I've met folks who are frustrated by the pace of change.

I understand that. But we knew this wouldn't be easy. The kind of change =
we're working for never comes easily.

Now is the time to begin again, and build the campaign that will shape our =
country's future.

Thank you,

Barack
