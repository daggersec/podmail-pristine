Time for Financial Regulators toLimit Speculation in Oil Market
=20
     The bigfluctuations in the price of crude oil over the last several we=
eks gave freshevidence of the ever increasing influence of speculators on t=
he price every dayAmericans pay for gasoline.  It is longpast time for the =
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC) to limit theinfluence of specul=
ators on the oil market =96 and the pocket books of Americanconsumers.
=20
     Big price swingsshow just how little the major fluctuations in the oil=
 market track theunderlying fundamentals of supply and demand. Those fundam=
entals did not provide any justification for a ten percentdecline in prices=
 that occurred last week =96 any more than they justified theearlier 25% pl=
us run up in prices that has resulted in $4.00 to $4.50 pergallon gasoline =
across the United States.
=20
     Only one thingchanged to cause last week=92s sell off in oil future: s=
peculators decided thatoil prices had reached their near-term peak and it w=
as time to take massive profits.
=20
     Some Wall Streetinvestment banks have been saying since mid-April that=
 the oil market was aboutto reverse.  Reuters reported on April 11that:
=20
     =93Long-term commodity bull Goldman Sachswarned clients on Monday to l=
ock-in trading profits before oil and othermarkets reverse, with the bank=
=92s estimates suggesting speculators are boostingcrude prices as much as $=
27 a barrel.=94
=20
     The speculativebubble in oil prices that has driven up gas prices this=
 Spring has costAmericans billions of dollars =96 money that goes directly =
into the pockets ofspeculators, multi-national oil companies and the bank a=
ccounts of royalfamilies in countries like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.=20
=20
     But speculativebubbles are not inevitable if commodities markets are p=
roperly regulated.  There are two distinctly different types ofinvestors in=
 commodities futures. Business that produce or use commodities =96 like air=
lines, or truckingfirms that consume large quantities of fuel =96 use futur=
es markets as hedgingstrategies to protect themselves from price volatility=
.  Their goal is to lock in a price range forcritical inputs =96 or, in the=
 case of farmers, for the products they sell.  That allows them to invest a=
nd produce with theconfidence that they can predict their costs or product =
prices.  That kind of predictability is enormouslyhelpful at encouraging th=
em to make the investments they need to plant theircrops, buy new airplanes=
 or invest in new plant and equipment.
=20
     Financialspeculators, on the other hand, don=92t produce anything.  Th=
ey are gamblers pure and simple.  They don=92t invest in commodity futures =
tolock in a price or cost.  They make moneyon the fluctuations in commodity=
 prices. They place bets that the price will go up or that it will drop.  S=
o they benefit when prices arevolatile.  They benefit from speculativebubbl=
es.  They bid up the price of oilwell above the supply and demand fundament=
als, since they are simply bettingthat someone else will keep buy more and =
more oil futures and the price willkeep going up.  As soon as the bubblebur=
sts and the price turns, the smart speculator reverses his positions =96 ta=
kesprofits and bets against the market =96 accelerating the market=92s decl=
ine.=20
=20
     Mats Olimb and Tore Malo =D8deg=E5rd  ofThe Norwegian University of Sc=
ience and Technology, published as study in 2009investigating the relations=
hip of speculative interest in commodity markets andprice volatility.  They=
 describe theeffect of speculation this way:
=20
The concern is that if thespeculators are dominant in the market, and a spe=
culative euphoria takes hold, self-reinforcingprice cycles may take place, =
where speculative flows of money drive prices andthese price movements can =
attract more speculative money. The result would behigh volatility and unce=
rtainty for physical producers and consumers.
=20
     The more purespeculators enter the market place, the greater the impac=
t of this puregambling on market prices. And over the last twenty years the=
 percentage of purefinancial speculation in commodity markets has soared.=
=20
=20
     The Olimb-Odegardstudy finds that speculative interest in crude oil ma=
rkets has doubled, from18% to 36% from 2003 to 2009.  Theyconclude that, =
=93there is a significant relationship between price movements andspeculati=
ve positions in crude oil.=94
=20
     Accordingto Reuters, Goldman Sachs hasestimated that =93 every million=
 barrels of oil held by speculators contributedto an 8-10 cent rise in the =
oil price.=94 Reuterscontinues:
=20
     TheU.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said that as of last Tues=
day (April5), hedge funds and other financial traders held total net-long p=
ositions inU.S. crude contracts equivalent to near record 267.5 million bar=
rels.=20
=20
     Using Goldman=92s estimates, that indicatesthe total speculative premi=
um in U.S. crude oil is currently between $21.40 and$26.75 a barrel, or abo=
ut a fifth of the price.=20
=20
    Traders and analysts have cautioned that speculative bets can quicklyun=
wind, dragging prices lower.
=20
     At yesterday=92s Senate hearing featuringthe CEO=92s of the five top o=
il companies, Rex Tillman, Exxon=92s CEO, confirmedthis analysis.  In answe=
r to a questionfrom Senator Cantwell (D-WA) he said that if pure competitiv=
e forces set themarket price of oil it should settle at the marginal cost o=
f producing the nextbarrel of oil =96 which he indicated was now between $6=
0 and $70 dollars abarrel.  Oil closed yesterday at justover $98 per barrel=
, so if he is correct about the marginal cost of production,speculation is =
currently adding from $30 to $40 to the price of oil.
=20
     Over the long haul, oil prices will, ofcourse, continue to rise since =
hydrocarbon fuels will be in shorter and shortersupply.  Their availability=
 is finite,and world demand continues to increase =96 even as demand for ga=
soline in theUnited States has actually experienced a decline.=20
=20
     That is precisely why the Obamaadministration=92s focus on new clean e=
nergy sources is so critical to America=92slong-term economic future.
=20
     But short-term bursts of gas prices havevery little to do with these l=
ong-term trends.  Turmoil in the Middle East has had very littleimpact on c=
urrent global oil supplies and mainly had an effect of creating morespecula=
tive fervor.
=20
     To limit the impact of pure speculation onour economy, a voices rangin=
g from the progressive Americans for FinancialReform (AFR) to the Air Trans=
port Association, have called on the CommoditiesFutures Trading Commission =
to issue rules (which it has the power to do) to capthe total value of spec=
ulative positions in any commodity market.  This would place limits on the =
percentage ofthe market composed of pure speculators, as opposed to busines=
ses (likeairlines and farmers) who buy futures to hedge their risk
=20
     Currently the CFTC has proposed a rulethat would limit any one trader=
=92s spot month position to 25% of the totalfinancial interest in a commodi=
ty.  Thatwould prevent any one trader from cornering a commodity market, bu=
t it wouldstill permit total speculative interest to drive markets and drow=
n out thelegitimate business related hedging interests.=20
=20
     The story of the recent oil price run-up isjust one more indication th=
at the growing financial sector is a cancer on theAmerican economy that mus=
t be brought under control.  Remember the gang that speculates in oil price=
sdoes not produce anything of any social value. They are professional gambl=
ers.  They are simply parasites on the economy thatsiphon off goods and ser=
vices made by people whom actually produce things for aliving.  They often =
make literallybillions for themselves in the process while the incomes of e=
veryday Americanshave stagnated.=20
=20
     The speculators and Wall Street banks hadtheir power reigned in by the=
 Obama Administration=92s Wall Street reform billthat passed Congress last =
year.  Now theyare doing everything they can to prevent it from being imple=
mented in anaggressive way by regulatory agencies. =20
=20
     Everyday Americans have to insist on anend to the speculative orgy. Th=
e priorities and values reflected in theAmerican economy must once again re=
ward hard work and innovation =96 notspeculation and greed.=20
