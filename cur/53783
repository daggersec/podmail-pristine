I would like to email my response to Politico.  I attempt to address all of=
 the quesitons the reporter has raised with me and the Transition press off=
ice.  Which are:=20

1) Is CAP still fundraising?=20

2) Has John solicited any funds on behalf of CAP?=20

3) Has John met with any donor or industry groups as head of the Transition=
 that may of do fund CAP?=20

4) Is the NY reception trading off of John's role at PTT?=20

5) Are we (does the Transition think we should) publicly disclose our donor=
s?=20

ANSWER: =20

The Center for American Progress and its c4 organization continue to operat=
e, albeit with scaled down fundraising activities.  In an abundance of caut=
ion and to avoid any confusion regarding John Podesta's current role at the=
 Presidential Transition Office, the Center has decided to not hold fundrai=
sers or conduct any online fundraising while he is on leave from the Center=
. =20

John Podesta has not solicited any funds on behalf of the Center since taki=
ng leave on November 5, nor has he met with any donor groups in his role as=
  co-chair of the Transition.   =20

In his personal capacity he fulfilled a long-standing commitment to be a pa=
nelist at a 200 person Democracy Alliance event on November 13.  He agreed =
to fulfill this commitment with the understanding that this would not be an=
 event where money was solicited (solicitations are not permitted at these =
DA annual meetings),  he would appear in his personal capacity and not as a=
 representative of the Transition, and would not share any non-public infor=
mation with the audience (it is worth noting the DA panel occurred after Po=
desta had held a 50 minute press briefing and appeared on two Sunday shows)=
.        =20

As noted, the reception in New York is not a fundrariser.  We made the spec=
ific decision not to do any fundraising in connection with "Change for Amer=
ica."=20

The Center follows all financial disclosure requirements.  A majority of ou=
r funding sources is already publicly known as all of our Foundation and la=
rgest individual donors have made their support public.  We respect the pri=
vacy of supporters who have chosen not to make their donations public.    =
=20

Subject: hey

so I may have been confused, but this doesn't seem to quite fit the model o=
f not using Podesta's name or trading on his insiderness that you were talk=
ing about yesterday. I understand that it's not a fundraiser per se, but al=
so that this went out to NY donor types:

PLEASE JOIN THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND

FOR AN INSIDER'S VIEW OF POLICY IDEAS FOR THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION FROM THE =
LEADING PROGRESSIVE THINK TANK

This reception (which is not a fundraiser) is a unique opportunity for a be=
hind-the-scenes conversation with nationally renowned experts from The Cent=
er for American Progress Action Fund, the think tank John Podesta founded 5=
 years ago. The reception is also a chance to discuss the soon to be releas=
ed book "Change for America--A Progressive Blueprint for the 44th President=
" with you, New York's leading progressives, and an opportunity to discuss =
policy prescriptions to our nation's challenges with experts who are active=
 in shaping the progressive agenda going forward.
