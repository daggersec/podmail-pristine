These are good. Let=B9s test these in the focus groups tonight for Dcorps.

Some of the rhetorical material won=B9t test well in a poll =8B and you get a
false read of their weakness.  You are playing off of McCain=B9s speech but i=
n
some cases but respondent won=B9t know that  We need to make sure we=B9re
testing the framework for each message in the poll for the key ones.

&quot;John McCain is an American hero. We honor his service to our nation. =
But his priorities don&#8217;t address the real problems of the American peo=
ple, because they are bound to the failed policies of the past.<BR>
George Bush won&#8217;t be on the ballot this November, but his war and his=
 tax cuts for the wealthy will.&quot;<BR>
=A0<BR>
&quot;When I am the nominee, I will offer a clear choice. John McCain won&#=
8217;t be able to say that I ever supported this war in Iraq, because I oppo=
sed it from the beginning. Senator McCain said the other day that we might b=
e mired for a hundred years in Iraq, which is reason enough to not give him =
four years in the White House.&quot;<BR>
=A0<BR>
&quot;If we had chosen a different path, the right path, we could have fini=
shed the job in Afghanistan, and put more resources into the fight against b=
in Laden; and instead of spending hundreds of billions of dollars in Baghdad=
, we could have put that money into our schools and hospitals, our road and =
bridges &#8211; and that&#8217;s what the American people need us to do righ=
t now.&quot;=A0 <BR>
&quot;And I admired Senator McCain when he stood up and said that it offend=
ed his &#8220;conscience&#8221; to support the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy=
 in a time of war; that he couldn&#8217;t support a tax cut where &#8220;so =
many of the benefits go to the most fortunate.&#8221;=A0 But somewhere along t=
he road to the Republican nomination, the Straight Talk Express lost its whe=
els, because now he&#8217;s all for them.&quot;=A0<BR>
=A0<BR>
&quot;Well I&#8217;m not.=A0 We can&#8217;t keep spending money that we don&#=
8217;t have in a war that we shouldn&#8217;t have fought. We can&#8217;t kee=
p mortgaging our children&#8217;s future on a mountain of debt. We can&#8217=
;t keep driving a wider and wider gap between the few who are rich and the r=
est who struggle to keep pace. It&#8217;s time to turn the page. &quot;<BR>
