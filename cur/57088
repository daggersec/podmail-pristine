*Main Topics: *Ted Kennedy's Illness, McLobbyist, Iran Spat
*
Summary of Shift:* Sen. Kennedy's seizure was found to be caused by a
malignant brain tumor. Reports on his condition and the well wishes of his
political colleagues were the content of much early broadcasting tonight.
After polls in Oregon and Kentucky closed the networks shifted gears to
primary coverage. Mentions of other topics were negligible at best.

*Highlights: *
1)    McCain: We will miss Ted Kennedy
2)    Obama and McCain continue to trade attacks
3)    McLobbyist Reporting

*Clips:*
*Highlight #1**
Sen. McCain Expresses his Wishes for the Swift Recovery of Sen. Kennedy,
Adds "We Will Miss Him"* (MSNBC 05/20/08 5:10pm)
JOHN MCCAIN: Ted Kennedy has a malignant brain tumor. Obviously our thoughts
and prayers go out to his family and to him. We hope and pray that they will
be able to treat. And that he will experience a full recovery. I have said
on numerous occasions, I have described Ted Kennedy as the last lion in the
senate . . . and I have held that view because he remains the single most
effective member of the senate. If you want to get results and he is not
reluctant to share the credit and when it fails he is willing to take the
blame. That's why he's one of the most members of the Senate and we'll miss
him for that and many other reasons.
*
Highlight #2*
*Fox Coverage of McCain-Obama Back and Forth on Iran* (FNC05/20/08 5:30pm)
BILL HEMMER: Obama and John McCain still slamming each other over diplomacy.
Obama says that we should talk to our enemies. McCain does not believe that.
Obama supporters often point to the historic meeting between John F Kennedy
and Soviet Premier Nikita Kruschev held during the height of the cold war
and Obama sees that as precedent

RICH LOWRY: I agree with the Obama people when they say that talking to
someone is not necessarily appeasement that is absolutely true but talking
to a foreign leader doesn't necessarily mean your going to be making any
progress, you may actually be going backwards. The Kennedy-Kruschev meeting
in 1961 in Vianna is a very good example of that

[...]

LOWRY: He (Kruschev) came away thinking Kennedy was weak. And that was a
very dangerous thing at such an unstable time and it may have played a role
in the subsequent cold war crisis to come, the building of the Berlin wall
and the Cuban missile crisis.

[...]

[Clip of McCain at town hall meeting]

JOHN MCCAIN: It's dangerous, it's dangerous to America's national security
if you sit down and give respect and prestige to leaders of countries that
are bent on your destruction or the destruction of other countries. I won't
do it my friends, obviously Senator Obama wants to

[---]

LOWRY: The thing is if Obama wants to meet with Iran as part of a strategy
to pressure them in some way if he thinks he has points of leverage over
them, but we don't at the moment. Obama has not made evident any strategy
deeper then talking to them. <http://www.box.net/shared/o0lmmxjoc0>

*Highlight #3
**McLobbyist Reporting Mischaracterized by Fox, McCain Fund Raising, Obama
Presumptive Target of GOP *(FNC 05/20/08 7:17pm)
CARL CAMERON: Already the McCain campaign has begun to turn its sights on
Barack Obama as the presumptive democratic nominee. Indeed the Republican
National Committee is churning out a couple of news releases every morning
and afternoon attacking Barack Obama and the GOP apparatus around the
country is sort of coalescing around the idea that it will be an Obama
McCain battle in the fall.

[...]

Over the last several days mr mccain has actually been removing some
lobbyist from his campaign staff with a tough new rule on the McCain
campaign  that folks who have been registered lobbyist can no longer be part
of his campaign and getting ready to go up against Obama and contrast his
experince to what he says is Obama's lack of it Brit.

BRIT HUME: Carl, lobbyist have a bad reputation, perticularly this political
season but it is a consitutionally protected activity afterall. A great many
of the political operatives that we all know who have worked for a multitude
of different candidates when they are not running campaigns are lobbying can
you really get through a full scale broadly gaged national election with no
lobbyist helping? I don't know that the Obama campaign will be able to do
that.

CAMERON: Uh, well no. In fact Obama has had people who have done lobbying
working around and with his campaign periodically though he says he doesn't
take any contributions from registered lobbyist and doesn't have any on his
staff right now. Senator McCain has let some people go in the last couple of
days because of this new rule.

[...]

CAMERON: It is worth noting that some of the lobbyist who have bailed out of
the McCain campaign were not dealing with folks who were necessarily
unsavory they just didn't meet McCain's stiff criteria for no lobbyist

[...]

CAMERON: tonight's the deadline for his last month fund raising report and
while we don't have a specific number it is going to be around twenty
million dollars which will be a record for John McCain as a Republican fund
raiser he has never been particularly strong in term of collecting donations
where republicans are concerned in part because he has always been concerned
as something of a maverick.
