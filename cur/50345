RFS out at 10:00. They anticipate muted reaction from ethanol gang.
Negative reaction from biodiesel. Very negative reaction from API. Hoping
for positive reaction from advanced. Not sure they'll get it. One thing to
look out for is a big new commitment to use CCC authority to put $100
million into E15 fueling infrastructure. Republicans will go crazy. We
should embrace that element when we are back in Iowa.
