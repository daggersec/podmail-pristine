Dear Eric

Great to be in touch virtually.

Are you flexible enough to be able to meet uptown in Friendship Heights?  I
can meet this afternoon but have meetings scheduled that make travel hard.
 I can meet at 3pm or 5pm if either of those work.

I am located at 5404 Wisconsin Avenue, Chevy Chase Maryland 20815 (the
Microsoft Building), Suite 410 if that will work?

best.

cdm
