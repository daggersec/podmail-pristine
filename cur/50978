----- Original Message -----

From: John Foust

John,

Earlier this month, I announced I'm running for re-election as Fairfax =
County Supervisor.

I'm so proud of the solutions we've achieved during my tenure, like =
strengthening our local economy, improving our schools, and growing our =
transportation infrastructure.

Despite our progress, local Republicans have their eye on my seat. That's =
why it's so important we lay the groundwork for a successful campaign.

John, will you chip in $5 or $10 tonight for my re-election campaign?

I hope I've made you proud over the last seven years. I'm committed to =
creating a bright future for our community, but I need your help to keep =
on working.

Thank you,

John Foust
