Let's do whatever is most convenient for you. Why don't you email or call (=
 704-619-6410) when you're finished at CAP ( you're the star and you'll end=
 up staying longer than you want ) and you can tell me where to meet you. I=
'm looking forward to it. E

Yes. Tried your cell. It's the CAP fundraiser that night. I have to go for =
a little bit, but would rather have dinner with you. It's at the Newseum. W=
e could meet there if you are so inclined and go out to the house or a rest=
aurant. Or I can meet you near your hotel at a restaurant or just meet up a=
t the house around 8:00. Preference?
