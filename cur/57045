Here is one crazy OH "earned" thought:

Next Thursday, May 15, 2008 MCCAIN in Columbus, OH: At 10 AM at the Vets
Memorial Auditorium.

Votevets just put together an ad in-house knocking McCain on the GI bill.
What about a tiny cosmetic ad buy with that
And a Vote vets presser in OH next Wednesday so McCain arrives to headlines
of "OH Veterans Push McCain to Support Troops"?

We could even mix this up with our McSame buy and team up with our local
partner Progress OH and Vote Vets to roll this out in OH.

It clearly looks that McCain understands the landscape in Ohio and will make
Southeast Ohio his battleground - see the attached chart.

He has been up for one week and will be for another two. In total he has
spent about $400k over this three week period. From what I can tell, that's
probably about 400 points in each, give or take a few.

This bothers me.
