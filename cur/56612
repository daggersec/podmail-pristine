I think our test for her public statement needs to be: could a regular
person watching the Ed Show walk away understanding if she's for or
against.  I kinda get the feeling she's against, but it's a long statement
and there are many qualifiers.  So from my narrow Iowa/progressive
lense...I think this pisses off both sides.  I'd strengthen, shorten and
make it clearer.  I know she hates that but this sounds like she's trying
to have it both ways.
