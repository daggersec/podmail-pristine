Dan -- This is completely fine.  We'll get it processed.  And yes, Ian can/=
should stay on Senate payroll.  The campaign also might give you a junior s=
taff assistant.  I'm assuming you can use him/her.  Looping in Brad Kiley w=
ho can implement this

Chris,

As you may have heard, John asked me to organize the econ transition until =
the senior Admin econ appointments are made.  I'm in the process of determi=
ning whole team, but want to get on board right away three econ policy peop=
le from campaign, one Of your former staff in the Senate office, plus one c=
ritical other person.

The three from the campaign are:

Jason Furman.  Proposed salary 100,000 annual equiv

Austan Goolsbee.  Unpaid

Brian Deese.  Proposed salary 75,000 annual equiv

The BO Senate staffer is Ian Solomon.  Ian is ubder the impression that he =
can stay on Senate payroll, so please let me know if this is incorrect

The fifth is Lee Sachs, a former asst sec of treasury who will be our key p=
oint person on the financial rescue effort. (Since Lee runs an asset manage=
ment firm, I've had him in touch with Cassandra to get the ethics stuff squ=
ared away.)  Unpaid

Thanks
Dan
