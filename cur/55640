Friend --

I learned the meaning of Memorial Day from my father, Hugh.

During World War II, my dad was a chief petty officer at the Great Lakes Na=
val Station outside of Chicago, responsible for training thousands of sailo=
rs before they went to the Pacific Theater. Sometimes, my dad accompanied h=
is trainees to the West Coast before they shipped out. He told me later tha=
t it broke his heart to know that some of them would never come home.

When my dad died twenty-two years ago, many sailors who had served under hi=
m sent me letters and photographs. My favorite photo shows my dad in his un=
iform smiling broadly. To me, he looked as handsome as any 1940s movie star=
. It meant a great deal to me that these men took time to honor my dad, the=
 same way my dad taught us to honor those who fell in the line of duty.

Today, I hope we=E2=80=99ll all take a moment to remember the many men and =
women who gave their lives to protect our country. These brave Americans kn=
ew that freedom is earned by each new generation.

My thoughts today are with those families whose sons and daughters sacrific=
ed so much so that all our children can be safe. I hope all of us will hono=
r their memories with our own service to our country, and to each other.

Thank you,

Hillary
