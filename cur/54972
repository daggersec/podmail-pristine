I think they're on to a big public health issue here. Resistance is a
major issue and is escalating.

I love talking to you and so value your guidance and our friendship.
Here is the latest news from our friends at the FDA.  We are going to
launch a major fight on this issue.  The board approved the funds to get
it started today.  And maybe some critical help will be on the way in
January!

Below is a story from today's WSJ on the FDA's decision to continue to
allow widespread use of antibiotics in food-producing animals, reversing
an earlier ban announced in July. Pew's Human Health & Industrial
Farming campaign is gauging an appropriate response and a plan to engage
the FDA directly on this critical decision.

Corporate News: FDA Calls Off Ban on Animal Antibiotics=20

By Alicia Mundy and Jared Favole=20

10 December 2008

The Wall Street Journal <javascript:void(0)>=20

B3

The Food and Drug Administration said it would continue allowing the
widespread use of a class of powerful antibiotics in food-producing
animals, making a last-minute reversal after calling the practice a
public-health risk in July.

The agency's bid this summer to ban many uses of cephalosporin drugs in
cows, swine, chickens and other animals came under fire from the
industry. Agriculture groups and animal-drug makers, including Pfizer
Inc <javascript:void(0);> ., said the antibiotics are needed to prevent
many infectious diseases in animals.

Public-health officials and the American Medical Association are worried
that excessive use of antibiotics -- including in animals -- can promote
resistance and produce strains of bacteria that threaten human life.
Cephalosporins treat respiratory diseases in cattle and swine but are
also often given "off-label" for uses not approved by the FDA to poultry
or more generally in livestock for non-approved infectious diseases.

On July 3, the FDA announced a planned crackdown on off-label uses in
animals, citing "the importance of cephalosporin drugs for treating
disease in humans."

That position was reiterated in September by the FDA's director of
veterinary drugs, Steven Vaughn. "We have [bacterial organisms] moving
around the world that we have never seen before," he told a conference,
according to Dairy Herd Management magazine. Dr. Vaughn, who couldn't be
reached for comment, told the group that antibiotic-resistant bacteria
are becoming more common in cattle.

Groups such as the Animal Population Health Institute, the Kansas Health
Department and the National Turkey Federation, objected to the proposed
ban. The American Veterinary Medical Association complained to the FDA
that the data on the human impact it used to support the ban were
flawed.

On Nov. 25, five days before the ban was to take effect, the FDA quietly
revoked it with a notice in the Federal Register. The FDA's statement
said the agency received many comments and needed more time to review
them. A spokeswoman said the agency still could impose restrictions
later.

"You have to give the FDA credit for its good-faith response to our
concerns," said Tom Burkgren, director of the Association of American
Swine Veterinarians. Dr. Burkgren said some of the new diseases striking
swine today aren't mentioned on cephalosporin labels, and there are few
alternatives.

Keep Antibiotics Working, a group that promotes agriculture-production
changes, denounced the FDA's reversal. "They were under a lot of
pressure from companies and agriculture, the producers, to end the ban,"
said the organization's chief, Steven Roach.

Pfizer <javascript:void(0);> , whose cephalosporin drug Excede is
approved for certain uses in animals, said more time is needed to
analyze the risk posed to treatment of animal diseases from
cephalosporin restrictions.

The FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine has been involved in other
recent controversies. In June, it abruptly announced it was allowing
Wyeth <javascript:void(0);> 's heartworm drug ProHeart 6 back on the
market. It was withdrawn in 2004=20
