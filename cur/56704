Dear John,

We're witnessing one of the worst environmental catastrophes in history. 11 workers killed. Four of the nation's top fishing ports crippled. Countless Gulf Coast jobs stand to be lost in the fallout.

We have the nation's attention right now. Everyone is astonished at the devastation caused by just one oil rig accident, and this is our chance to finally change votes in the Senate.

Just yesterday, Senators John Kerry and Joseph Lieberman introduced clean
energy and climate legislation. Now it's time for Senator Harry Reid and President Obama to work with them and other Senators to pass a strong bill
this year. We can prevent new drilling and transition to a clean energy economy - but we need your help.

LCV must raise $35,000 in the next 8 days to continue our push for clean energy and climate legislation in the Senate that curbs our dependence on oil.
Please contribute today!
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=GifjyFnwFX5ysuHSdyS5WQ..

Your gift now will immediately go to work to: 

*  Continue our massive lobbying efforts in the Senate to pass clean energy and climate legislation and oppose new drilling. We'll be targeting swing votes as we expose Big Oil's reckless campaign to keep us addicted to oil.
*  Tell voters exactly where their candidates stand on clean energy and the big environmental issues facing our nation - through our signature programs like Dirty Dozen and Environmental Champions.
*  Expose the truth about dirty energy - and this spill's -economic cost. Using
our decades of experience - including door-to-door canvassing, phone banks, and targeted mail, we'll show the toll this addiction to oil is taking. This spill may cripple the Gulf Coast's economy for years.
*  Urge opposition to legislation that would prevent the EPA from regulating global warming pollution under the Clean Air Act. This vote could happen next
week!

LCV knows how to out-maneuver even the dirtiest lawmakers. But we can only
be as aggressive as our resources allow.

Please, help us fight to prevent more tragedies like the BP Gulf Coast Disaster - make a gift by May 21st to fight for a comprehensive clean energy and climate bill in the Senate.
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Ffd1R8qT3Ko9UpIpSGoexg..

Thank you for your support at this pivotal moment.

Sincerely,
Gene Karpinski
League of Conservation Voters

P.S. Over the first three weeks of the oil spill, BP spent $350 million on the cleanup, but with profits averaging $93 million a day they can cover their cost
thus far with just four days of profits. Please, contribute to our fight for a clean energy future that breaks our dangerous addiction to oil.
