There's nothing like actually polling women to debunk the claim that McCain
can win women. Since Clinton's exit, Obama's lead with women has grown by 7
-- Obama now leads McCain among women by 13 points. He's made significant
gains with older and married women, groups McCain was eying.
http://www.gallup.com/poll/107806/Obama-Gains-Among-Women-After-Clinton-Exit.aspxJune
11, 2008 Obama Gains Among Women After Clinton Exit Now running as strongly
vs. McCain among women as Clinton did by Jeffrey M. Jones

PRINCETON, NJ -- Since Hillary Clinton decided to concede the Democratic
nomination to Barack Obama last week, Obama has established a lead over
Republican John
McCain<http://www.gallup.com/poll/107791/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Lead-Appears-Stabilize.aspx>in
general-election polling. Obama's gains have come more from women than
men, though he has picked up among both groups in recent days.

 Obama's lead among women has now expanded from five percentage points to
13, while his deficit among men has shrunk from six points to two.

These figures are based on aggregated Gallup Poll Daily tracking interviews
with national registered voters conducted May 27-June 2 (the week
immediately before Obama clinched the nomination on June 3), which showed
Obama and McCain tied at 46%, and June 5-9 (the five days since it was
reported that Clinton would suspend her campaign), which show Obama ahead,
48% to 42%. Obama clinched the nomination on the evening of June 3, and the
news media reported Clinton would suspend her campaign on the evening of
June 4. Thus, the data give a clear picture of voter support before and
after Clinton's exit.

While campaigning for president, Clinton demonstrated an especially strong
appeal to women. She led McCain by 52% to 40% in her final full week as a
candidate, exactly equal to the average since mid-March. By comparison,
Obama held only an average 47% to 42% lead over McCain among women during
the same time span. At least for now, he seems to be matching Clinton's
performance among women versus McCain, given his current 13-point lead among
female voters.

One of Clinton's core groups of supporters during the nomination phase of
the campaign was older women. During the last few days of her active
candidacy, Clinton led McCain by 51% to 41% among women aged 50 and older,
while Obama *trailed* McCain among this group, 46% to 43%.

Since Clinton suspended her campaign, older women's vote preferences have
shifted toward Obama, so that he now enjoys a six-point advantage over
McCain.

Obama had always run much better among younger women, in large part because
of his strong appeal to younger voters. But his support has also risen among
women aged 18 to 49 in the past few days, further expanding his already
formidable 52% to 40% lead over McCain to 56% to 35%.

Obama has made major gains in the past few days among married women, erasing
McCain's former 52% to 40% lead and pulling into a 45% to 45% tie.
Meanwhile, the vote preferences among married men (a solid McCain group) and
unmarried men and women (solid Obama groups) have changed little since
Clinton decided to end her White House bid.

Obama has also seen his support among non-Hispanic white women increase
modestly, though McCain still holds a slim 46% to 43% advantage among this
group. Prior to Clinton's departure, McCain led Obama by 50% to 41% among
white women.

Interestingly, while white women were a major part of Clinton's primary
constituency, she maintained only a slim (if any) advantage in
general-election trial heats versus McCain among this group. In the last
week of her campaign, she only tied McCain among white women, at 47%. Thus,
her strong performance against McCain among all female voters in
presidential trial heats was primarily because of strong support from
minority women.

*Implications*

Obama's recent gains in the polls have been greatly aided by increased
support from female voters. Now that Clinton is no longer campaigning and
the focus of voters' decision-making is a choice between Obama and McCain,
female voters may be taking a second look at Obama. Indeed, his current
13-point advantage over McCain is essentially the same advantage that
Clinton held over McCain throughout her active candidacy.

Obama's challenge in the general-election campaign will be to bring core
Democratic groups that did not strongly support him in the primaries --
women, voters with less formal education, and conservative Democrats -- back
into the fold. He appears to be already doing that among women. However, it
is not clear whether this is just a temporary rally in support for him upon
clinching the nomination, or whether he will be able to sustain a high level
of support from female voters for the duration of the campaign.

June 10, 2008 Gallup Daily: Obama's Lead Stabilizing Leads McCain 48% to 41%
in latest presidential trial heat

PRINCETON, NJ -- Barack Obama has a 48% to 41% lead in the latest Gallup
Poll Daily tracking
<http://www.gallup.com/tag/Gallup%2bDaily.aspx>presidential election
trial heat, based on June 7-9 polling.

Voting preferences have been fairly stable over the last three individual
days of tracking polling, all conducted since Hillary Clinton officially
suspended her candidacy and publicly endorsed Obama for president on
Saturday.

The seven percentage point advantage is Obama's largest to date since Gallup
began tracking the general election in March. In turn, McCain has led Obama
by as many as six percentage points in early May. (To view the complete
