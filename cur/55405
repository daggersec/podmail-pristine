*WITH LOBBYIST CHARLIE BLACK IN THE LEAD, MCCAIN CAN'T MAKE THE CASE FOR
CHANGE

**Why does Senator John McCain Allow Adviser Charlie Black to undo his
"reformer" image? Charlie Black is in the news yet again as McCain travels
to Mexico and Colombia, this time for lobbying on behalf of a top foreign
producer of oil and gas in Colombia with a history of human rights abuses.
This controversy is just the latest for Black, who as a lobbyist has
regularly represented brutal human rights dictators, lobbied for a company
that did business with Iran, and helped sell the Iraq war.*
*
* *McCain has no credibility to make the case for change when he is surrounded
by lobbyists like Charlie Black who have made millions fighting against the
interests of Americans*.

*McCain has had at least 134
LOBBYISTS<http://mccainsource.com/corruption?id=0006>like Black
advising, working for or raising money for his presidential
campaign.* These lobbyist advisers have made millions advocating for big
oil, insurance companies, Iraq contractors and white-washing the crimes of
dictators.

   - *Black has made more than $1.6
million<http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/us/politics/01black.html?ref=politics&pagewanted=print>lobbying
for the top foreign gas and oil company in Colombia since 1998.
   * Black's client, Occidental Petroleum, was sued in
1998<http://www.forusa.org/programs/colombia/col-update-8-25-03.html>following
the bombing of a Colombian village -- and the death of 17
   civilians. In 2007, Occidental was implicated
   <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/01/mccain-heads-to-colombia_n_110108.html>in
   the murder of three labor leaders.


   - *Black's firm has more than $4
million<http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/332544>lobbying
for defense contractors who have made billions from the war in
   Iraq.  *Black's firm, BKSH, has lobbied for 8 (or roughly 13%) of the top
   60 companies receiving DOD contracts during 2007, including the top DOD
   contractor (Lockheed Martin).


   - *Black helped lead secretive campaign for retro-active immunity to help
   Bush, AT&T. *Black was behind <http://www.newsweek.com/id/41142> a
   White-House-sanctioned lobbying campaign to push Congress to grant
   retro-active immunity to telecom companies that participated in warrantless
   surveillance programs.
