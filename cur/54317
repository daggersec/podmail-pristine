Teresa, thank you for sharing this information and the communications with
us.  Certainly you are doing the right thing to get in front of the OCR
release.  From what I understand, the OCR release will be be quite limited
in detail, but it will get press.  In your opinion, do we have a risk that
the Complainant would go public with her story and draw more scrutiny?
 -Laura
