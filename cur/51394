A couple of things to consider if you were to use WikiWisdom:

1.   It is designed to be used with a group peers in this instance the
peers would be registered Democrats or Independents who self identify as
planning to  vote in the 2016 Democratic primary in their appropriate state.

The Campaign would be doing the inviting and I assume as access already to
a data base in each state of Democratic primary  voters with emails.

By controlling who is invited helps address the troll issue.

2.  Although the "brainstorming" phase online will gather attention it is
really the dozen "thought leaders" who are chosen to prepare the report
with the moderator and then present in person to HRC the results that are
the key.   We use an algorithm to create a list of potential thought
leaders and then chose the actual group in consultation with our clients.
This gives us an ability to weed out potential embarrassing choices.   For
example in NC recently for a health system one of thought leaders we were
going to choose had been on several reality shows.  The client knew this,
we did not, so that person was in the end not chosen.

3.  I think the presentation meetings offer you a chance to show case HRC
in a setting she masters -- thoughtful, probing back forth on issues of
substance - and to do so in a format -- not unlike the Black Lives Matter
video -- where her authenticity shines through.

4.  Lastly we could work with you to chose former journalists to be the
moderates of each particular project - NH, IO, SC or Black Lives.
