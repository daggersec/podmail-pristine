John --=20

You know what's not funny? When 80 members of Congress say
they'll refuse to do their jobs just because they don't get
their way.

That's what happened last week when a gang of House
Republicans sent Speaker John Boehner a letter informing him
that they'd rather trigger a government shutdown before
voting for a budget that funds Obamacare.=20

It's an absolutely absurd demand -- and it's forcing John
Boehner to make a decision: be a leader or cave to the
extreme members of the House.

The good news is that a lot of folks across the country are=20
sick of these games.

Add your name -- tell Speaker Boehner to stand up to
anti-Obamacare bullies in Congress right now:
