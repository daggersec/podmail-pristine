LYNN SWEET <mailto:lsweet3022@aol.com>  | 'Hillary is ready to lead,' =
says Jacqueline, whose activist husband, congressman son favor Obama=20


November 30, 2007
BY LYNN SWEET <mailto:lsweet3022@aol.com>  Sun-Times Columnist

NEW YORK -- As Barack Obama stumped in Harlem on Thursday, Jacqueline =
Jackson endorsed Hillary Clinton, with the family of the Rev. Jesse =
Jackson divided over the two Democratic front-runners.=20

"Hillary is ready to lead on her first day in the White House and =
immediately begin delivering the change this country needs," Jacqueline =
Jackson told the Chicago Sun-Times.=20

Clinton and Obama are in an increasing crucial battle over female and =
African-American voters, with neither rival conceding any racial, gender =
or geographical turf.=20

On Thursday, Obama picked up the Rev. Al Sharpton at his Harlem =
headquarters -- just a few blocks from former President Bill Clinton's =
office -- and stopped for a photo op with him at a famous soul food =
restaurant, Sylvia's.=20

Obama topped off a heavy day of high-end fund-raising in Manhattan with =
a low-dollar fund-raiser at the famed Apollo Theater, where he was =
introduced by comedian Chris Rock.=20

The Rev. Jesse Jackson is supporting Obama, though the former two-time =
presidential candidate has no public role in the campaign. Last fall, =
Jackson said Obama was "acting like he was white" because he did not do =
more in the wake of the "Jena 6" case.=20

Jackson Sr. wrote in his latest column he was disappointed in all the =
Democratic candidates -- except John Edwards -- for ignoring "the plight =
of African Americans in this country." One of his sons, Rep. Jesse =
Jackson Jr.( D-Ill.), is on the Obama campaign leadership team.=20

Another son who lives in Chicago, Yusef, is a major Clinton fund-raiser =
who has bundled together at least $100,000 in contributions.=20

Now his mother is also siding with Clinton and may go on the road to =
stump for her. If she goes to South Carolina -- where Jackson Sr. was =
born and where he won the 1988 presidential primary -- she will find =
herself having to dilute the impact of radio ads her son Jesse Jr. has =
made for Obama.=20

Jacqueline Jackson is an activist in her own right; in June 2001, she =
was jailed for 10 days in Puerto Rico protesting the U.S. Navy's using =
the island of Vieques for a bombing range.

Sharpton has been wooed by Clinton and Obama all year. "I've not made a =
decision. I will very shortly," Sharpton said, noting that racial =
tensions have increased recently over the Jena 6 incident, Don Imus =
comments and other hate crimes.=20

Sharpton said he has been telling all candidates "we need to address the =
problems of hate crime ... and he [Obama] is the first candidate to say, =
'Yeah, we need to talk about it,' so he came to my headquarters and =
picked me up and said, 'Let's go to dinner and talk,' and so he and I =
went to dinner and talked."

NEW YORK (AP) _ Invoking a racially charged controversy, Democrat Barack =
Obama said at a Harlem fundraiser that he deplored the fact that hanging =
nooses and ''Jena Six'' cases are still found in America and that if =
elected president he could be counted on to enforce civil rights laws.=20

Obama's reference to the Jena Six incident, in which six black teenagers =
were arrested for beating a white teen after white students allegedly =
hung nooses at their Jena, Louisiana, high school, came at a fundraiser =
at the historic Apollo Theater in Harlem.=20

The U.S. senator, who is running to be the first black president, =
touched on several themes of racial justice before the largely black =
audience. He said he was tired of seeing young black men ''languishing'' =
on city streets and that he dreaded the thought of living through =
another administration that appeared to care little for the concerns of =
minority citizens.=20

''I don't want to wake up in four years and find out we still have more =
black men in prison than in college,'' he said to cheers.=20

Hundreds of supporters paid $50 (euro34) apiece to attend the =
fundraiser, which marked Obama's first visit to Harlem since launching =
his presidential bid. He was introduced by comedian Chris Rock, who =
cracked up the audience with the evening's only direct reference to =
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Obama's chief rival for the Democratic =
nomination.=20

He told the audience they'd be ''real embarrassed'' if Obama won and =
they had been backing Clinton instead. ''You'd say, 'I had that white =
lady! What was I thinking?'''=20

Cornel West, a longtime black history professor at universities =
including Harvard and Princeton, also appeared onstage to welcome Obama. =
He called Obama ''an eloquent brother, a good brother, a decent =
brother,'' and appeared to address concerns voiced by some black leaders =
that Obama was a relative newcomer to the civil rights movement.=20

''Barack Obama comes at an incredibly powerful moment in the year 2007, =
and we don't expect him to be Marcus Garvey ... or Martin Luther King,'' =
West said of the two famed civil rights icons.=20

Before the fundraiser Obama dined with Al Sharpton, a national civil =
rights leader and Harlem denizen who ran for the Democratic presidential =
nomination in 2004.=20

The two men ate fried chicken and cornbread at Sylvia's, a popular =
Harlem restaurant. But Sharpton said the visit should not be construed =
as an endorsement of Obama's candidacy.=20

Clinton, Democrats find religion, court evangelical voters

A wise man once said it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye =
of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven - and it used to be =
nearly as tough for a Democratic candidate to take a presidential =
campaign to a conservative evangelical church.

But Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton did just that Thursday with a visit to =
one of the country's most influential megachurches that dramatized the =
new Democratic efforts to win support from evangelical voters that the =
party once considered out of reach.=20

Clinton received a standing ovation from a full house at Saddleback =
Church in Lake Forest at the annual Global Summit on AIDS and the Church =
hosted by the Rev. Rick Warren and his wife, Kay. Warren, a youthful, =
bearded, blue-jeans-wearing pastor who hails from San Jose, is the =
author of "A Purpose Driven Life" - which has sold more than 23 million =
copies and ranks as one of the best-selling nonfiction books in history. =
The church that he and his wife lead attracts as many as 20,000 =
attendees to its diverse Sunday services - gospel, traditional, "worship =
rock," Polynesian and singles among them.=20

Last year, Warren welcomed Democratic Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois to =
the stage at Saddleback, and this year, the minister invited all the =
presidential candidates in both parties to address his congregation on =
the HIV pandemic. With just five weeks until voting begins in the =
presidential nominating contest, only Clinton came in person; =
Republicans Mike Huckabee, John McCain and Mitt Romney and Democrats =
Obama and John Edwards addressed the congregation through videos.=20

Clinton delivered an unusually personal, often emotional speech that =
quoted regularly from Scripture and explored issues including her =
religious experiences.

"I was fortunate enough to be raised to understand the power and the =
purpose of prayer ... but had I not been, probably one week in the White =
House would have turned me into one," she said to laughs.

Clinton said that in her most difficult times, there was a White House =
prayer group "whose love and support sustained me."

But Clinton told the audience of about 1,700 people that action goes =
hand in hand with faith. She won applause when she proposed $50 billion =
for AIDS treatment and prevention and promised to "set a goal of ending =
all deaths from malaria in Africa" - where 1 million die annually from =
the disease - by the end of a second term.

The Democratic candidate did not shy away from more controversial =
ground, telling congregants "it is long past time that we do everything =
we can to stand up for the proposition that women's rights are human =
rights."

"Girls denied their human rights are girls at risk for AIDS. ... Even in =
our own country today, women are now the face of AIDS," she said, =
arguing that world and church leaders must address the sexual =
trafficking of girls worldwide.=20

The visit by the Democratic front-runner to the Orange County megachurch =
highlighted a changing political strategy among Democrats. National =
Party Chairman Howard Dean, who once dismissed Republicans as a "white =
Christian party," has more recently urged Democrats to open their arms =
to young evangelicals and a new generation of religious leaders such as =
Warren.

Burns Strider, the national director of faith-based outreach for the =
Clinton campaign, said the New York senator - a United Methodist - =
relished the opportunity to "join with people of faith" to talk about =
fighting AIDS. He said Clinton believes that Democrats "have got to find =
a common ground" with millions of evangelical voters - a widely diverse, =
engaged constituency.

"Younger leaders are opening the door ... and we welcome the dialogue," =
Strider said.=20

Religious scholars said such efforts could change the parameters of a =
once-predictable political strategy: Democrats aiming for dominance in =
urban African American churches with the help of politically liberal =
leaders such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton and =
Republicans courting conservative white evangelicals with televangelists =
such as Pat Robertson and the now-deceased Jerry Falwell.

Now there is a fertile new middle ground to be plowed in churches such =
as Saddleback, whose leaders like Warren eschew divisive partisan talk =
and political wedge issues. Instead, they "emphasize much less the =
notion of a vengeful, judgmental God," said Mathew Schmalz, professor of =
religious studies at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.=20

The approach has proved successful in appealing to millions who want =
religious experiences that "emphasize the Bible and teachings of Jesus =
as a blueprint for living, a guide for living a full and healthy life," =
he said. That has forged a new evangelical profile which "is becoming =
more diverse ... interested in more socially progressive issues" such as =
poverty, illiteracy, the AIDS epidemic in Africa and the violence in =
Darfur.=20

Churches such as Saddleback now offer Christian families "a sense of =
community and Bible-based truth, but they apply it more flexibly," =
Schmalz said. "They are people who are more upwardly mobile, urban =
professional types who don't necessarily live within a traditional =
evangelical homeschooling world."

GOP consultant Patrick Dorinson said California is particularly =
important for the new political constituency of these evangelicals.=20

"This is a new movement that has come into the suburbs," Dorinson said. =
"They want spirituality in their lives, and they got kids, and they want =
an anchor. They join these churches to be uplifted ... and they don't =
want to be told who to hate.

"You'll see a fight for these voters," he said. "And for Hillary to go =
is a smart political move."

California Democratic political strategist Garry South - raised as a =
devout evangelical by churchgoing parents in rural Montana - said that =
in 2008, Clinton and his party's candidates appear to have acknowledged =
that "if we don't engage these voters, we deserve to lose."

South noted that churchgoing Americans were historically a =
Democratic-leaning, working-class demographic "whose dads remembered =
FDR" and whose main concerns were fiscal: "trying to feed a family, get =
a better job and get their kids into college."

But powerful lobbying groups such as the Christian Coalition and leaders =
such as Falwell and Robertson gained clout and took a direct role in GOP =
politics in the 1980s and 1990s, firing up religious voters on explosive =
issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage.

"They wanted to peel (evangelicals) away to the Republicans ... and the =
strategy largely worked," he said.=20

Clinton, in her talk at Saddleback, told the audience of what she said =
was one of her favorite Scriptural passages, "the line from James: =
'Faith without works is dead.' "

"Here, in what you're doing, faith and works come together - and you =
understand that," she said. "And what extraordinary, important work your =
faith supports."

A Saddleback Church congregant, Tonie Kennedy, said after the speech =
that Clinton's venture to the evangelical congregation "was a good =
decision."

"It shows me she has her own faith," Kennedy said, "and that she has an =
interest in what's going on in the churches."

Clinton is competing with fellow Democrats Obama and Edwards to expand =
their bases to include these "values voters" found in churches such as =
Saddleback.

"Sen. Clinton has the boldness to broaden her base ... it shows she's =
done her homework and she's open to new ideas," said Vivian Berryhill, =
president and founder of the National Coalition of Pastors' Spouses, one =
of the groups courted by Clinton's campaign.=20

"We're very religious in this country, and these are the people who =
helped elect (Republican President) Bush," said Berryhill, motioning =
around at the convention-center-size Saddleback worship hall. "So for =
her to come here is a gutsy move."

Obama turns up heat in Harlem with fundraiser

BY KATIE THOMAS | katie.thomas@newsday.com =
<mailto:katie.thomas@newsday.com?subject=3DNewsday.com%20Article> =20

11:19 PM EST, November 29, 2007=20

Barack Obama delivered an urgent and sometimes confrontational speech to =
a sold-out crowd at the landmark Apollo Theater Thursday night, at a =
fund- raiser that marked his first campaign visit to Harlem.

"I want to stand up for those who still hunger for opportunity, who =
still thirst for justice," Obama told the crowd of 1,500 assembled =
inside the theater, who had paid $50 each to attend. "I don't want to =
wake up four years from now to find that we missed the opportunity. We =
cannot wait."

In a historic theater made famous by black entertainers such as Billie =
Holiday and James Brown, Obama brought a little star power of his own. =
He was introduced by comedian Chris Rock and historian Cornel West.

West urged the audience to make that connection to history, saying =
entertainers like Brown and Holiday "represent a way of life that goes =
all the way back from the old spirituals on up to Barack Obama running =
for president. Let's have a sense of history."

Obama's visit to the Apollo, in the heart of what many consider the =
capital of black America, might seem a natural for the man who is =
campaigning to become the first African-American president in history.

But Obama's support among black voters hasn't been a given. A CNN poll =
in October found that, nationwide, registered voters who are black =
favored Hillary Rodham Clinton by 24 percentage points over Obama -- an =
edge that is due in part to Clinton's perceived electability but also to =
the overwhelming popularity of Bill Clinton among many =
African-Americans.

Rock acknowledged Hillary Clinton's popularity in Harlem but urged the =
crowd to choose Obama instead. "Because we'd be real embarrassed if he =
won and we wasn't down," he said, imitating a Hillary supporter saying =
ruefully, "I had that white lady. What was I thinking?"

Obama also threw jabs at Clinton, not mentioning her name but saying he =
was a candidate who wouldn't have to explain why he voted to authorize =
the war in Iraq.

He alluded to the partisan wars of the 1990s and the 2000 election, =
saying "I don't want to pit red states against blue states. I want to =
lead the United States of America."

The trip to the Apollo sends a signal to Clinton that Obama intends to =
compete with her on her home turf -- and not just in New York, but in =
Harlem, where support for the New York senator is strong. Bill Clinton =
maintains his office a few blocks from the Apollo, and Hillary Clinton =
has the support of many of Harlem's leaders, including Rep. Charles =
Rangel.

Thursday, Obama seemed to be courting a Harlem endorsement of his own -- =
that of the Rev. Al Sharpton, who shared chicken and corn bread with =
Obama at Sylvia's Restaurant before his speech.

During the meal, Sharpton said he had not yet endorsed anyone, "but a =
man that likes chicken and corn bread can't be that bad."

<P><STRONG><FONT face=3DVerdana>Clinton, Democrats find religion, court =
evangelical voters</FONT></STRONG></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>A wise man once said it was easier for =
a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get =
into heaven - and it used to be nearly as tough for a Democratic =
candidate to take a presidential campaign to a conservative evangelical =
church.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>But Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton did =
just that Thursday with a visit to one of the country's most influential =
megachurches that dramatized the new Democratic efforts to win support =
from evangelical voters that the party once considered out of reach. =
</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Clinton received a standing ovation =
from a full house at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest at the annual =
Global Summit on AIDS and the Church hosted by the Rev. Rick Warren and =
his wife, Kay. Warren, a youthful, bearded, blue-jeans-wearing pastor =
who hails from San Jose, is the author of "A Purpose Driven Life" - =
which has sold more than 23 million copies and ranks as one of the =
best-selling nonfiction books in history. The church that he and his =
wife lead attracts as many as 20,000 attendees to its diverse Sunday =
services - gospel, traditional, "worship rock," Polynesian and singles =
among them. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Last year, Warren welcomed Democratic =
Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois to the stage at Saddleback, and this year, =
the minister invited all the presidential candidates in both parties to =
address his congregation on the HIV pandemic. With just five weeks until =
voting begins in the presidential nominating contest, only Clinton came =
in person; Republicans Mike Huckabee, John McCain and Mitt Romney and =
Democrats Obama and John Edwards addressed the congregation through =
videos. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Clinton delivered an unusually =
personal, often emotional speech that quoted regularly from Scripture =
and explored issues including her religious experiences.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"I was fortunate enough to be raised to =
understand the power and the purpose of prayer ... but had I not been, =
probably one week in the White House would have turned me into one," she =
said to laughs.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Clinton said that in her most difficult =
times, there was a White House prayer group "whose love and support =
sustained me."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>But Clinton told the audience of about =
1,700 people that action goes hand in hand with faith. She won applause =
when she proposed $50 billion for AIDS treatment and prevention and =
promised to "set a goal of ending all deaths from malaria in Africa" - =
where 1 million die annually from the disease - by the end of a second =
term.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>The Democratic candidate did not shy =
away from more controversial ground, telling congregants "it is long =
past time that we do everything we can to stand up for the proposition =
that women's rights are human rights."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"Girls denied their human rights are =
girls at risk for AIDS. ... Even in our own country today, women are now =
the face of AIDS," she said, arguing that world and church leaders must =
address the sexual trafficking of girls worldwide. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>The visit by the Democratic =
front-runner to the Orange County megachurch highlighted a changing =
political strategy among Democrats. National Party Chairman Howard Dean, =
who once dismissed Republicans as a "white Christian party," has more =
recently urged Democrats to open their arms to young evangelicals and a =
new generation of religious leaders such as Warren.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Burns Strider, the national director of =
faith-based outreach for the Clinton campaign, said the New York senator =
- a United Methodist - relished the opportunity to "join with people of =
faith" to talk about fighting AIDS. He said Clinton believes that =
Democrats "have got to find a common ground" with millions of =
evangelical voters - a widely diverse, engaged constituency.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"Younger leaders are opening the door =
... and we welcome the dialogue," Strider said. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Religious scholars said such efforts =
could change the parameters of a once-predictable political strategy: =
Democrats aiming for dominance in urban African American churches with =
the help of politically liberal leaders such as the Rev. Jesse Jackson =
and the Rev. Al Sharpton and Republicans courting conservative white =
evangelicals with televangelists such as Pat Robertson and the =
now-deceased Jerry Falwell.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Now there is a fertile new middle =
ground to be plowed in churches such as Saddleback, whose leaders like =
Warren eschew divisive partisan talk and political wedge issues. =
Instead, they "emphasize much less the notion of a vengeful, judgmental =
God," said Mathew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at the College =
of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>The approach has proved successful in =
appealing to millions who want religious experiences that "emphasize the =
Bible and teachings of Jesus as a blueprint for living, a guide for =
living a full and healthy life," he said. That has forged a new =
evangelical profile which "is becoming more diverse ... interested in =
more socially progressive issues" such as poverty, illiteracy, the AIDS =
epidemic in Africa and the violence in Darfur. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Churches such as Saddleback now offer =
Christian families "a sense of community and Bible-based truth, but they =
apply it more flexibly," Schmalz said. "They are people who are more =
upwardly mobile, urban professional types who don't necessarily live =
within a traditional evangelical homeschooling world."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>GOP consultant Patrick Dorinson said =
California is particularly important for the new political constituency =
of these evangelicals. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"This is a new movement that has come =
into the suburbs," Dorinson said. "They want spirituality in their =
lives, and they got kids, and they want an anchor. They join these =
churches to be uplifted ... and they don't want to be told who to =
hate.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"You'll see a fight for these voters," =
he said. "And for Hillary to go is a smart political move."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>California Democratic political =
strategist Garry South - raised as a devout evangelical by churchgoing =
parents in rural Montana - said that in 2008, Clinton and his party's =
candidates appear to have acknowledged that "if we don't engage these =
voters, we deserve to lose."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>South noted that churchgoing Americans =
were historically a Democratic-leaning, working-class demographic "whose =
dads remembered FDR" and whose main concerns were fiscal: "trying to =
feed a family, get a better job and get their kids into =
college."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>But powerful lobbying groups such as =
the Christian Coalition and leaders such as Falwell and Robertson gained =
clout and took a direct role in GOP politics in the 1980s and 1990s, =
firing up religious voters on explosive issues such as abortion and =
same-sex marriage.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"They wanted to peel (evangelicals) =
away to the Republicans ... and the strategy largely worked," he said. =
</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Clinton, in her talk at Saddleback, =
told the audience of what she said was one of her favorite Scriptural =
passages, "the line from James: 'Faith without works is dead.' =
"</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"Here, in what you're doing, faith and =
works come together - and you understand that," she said. "And what =
extraordinary, important work your faith supports."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>A Saddleback Church congregant, Tonie =
Kennedy, said after the speech that Clinton's venture to the evangelical =
congregation "was a good decision."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"It shows me she has her own faith," =
Kennedy said, "and that she has an interest in what's going on in the =
churches."</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>Clinton is competing with fellow =
Democrats Obama and Edwards to expand their bases to include these =
"values voters" found in churches such as Saddleback.</FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"Sen. Clinton has the boldness to =
broaden her base ... it shows she's done her homework and she's open to =
new ideas," said Vivian Berryhill, president and founder of the National =
Coalition of Pastors' Spouses, one of the groups courted by Clinton's =
campaign. </FONT></P>=0A=
<P><FONT face=3DVerdana size=3D2>"We're very religious in this country, =
and these are the people who helped elect (Republican President) Bush," =
said Berryhill, motioning around at the convention-center-size =
Saddleback worship hall. "So for her to come here is a gutsy =
move."</FONT></P>=0A=

speech to a sold-out crowd at the landmark Apollo Theater Thursday =
night, at a fund- raiser that marked his first campaign visit to =
Harlem.<BR><BR>"I want to stand up for those who still hunger for =
opportunity, who still thirst for justice," Obama told the crowd of =
1,500 assembled inside the theater, who had paid $50 each to attend. "I =
don't want to wake up four years from now to find that we missed the =
opportunity. We cannot wait."<BR><BR>In a historic theater made famous =
by black entertainers such as Billie Holiday and James Brown, Obama =
brought a little star power of his own. He was introduced by comedian =
Chris Rock and historian Cornel West.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>=0A=

FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New =

saying entertainers like Brown and Holiday "represent a way of life that =
goes all the way back from the old spirituals on up to Barack Obama =
running for president. Let's have a sense of history."<BR><BR>Obama's =
visit to the Apollo, in the heart of what many consider the capital of =
black America, might seem a natural for the man who is campaigning to =
become the first African-American president in history.<BR><BR>But =
Obama's support among black voters hasn't been a given. A CNN poll in =
October found that, nationwide, registered voters who are black favored =
Hillary Rodham Clinton by 24 percentage points over Obama -- an edge =
that is due in part to Clinton's perceived electability but also to the =
overwhelming popularity of Bill Clinton among many =
African-Americans.<BR><BR>Rock acknowledged Hillary Clinton's popularity =
in Harlem but urged the crowd to choose Obama instead. "Because we'd be =
real embarrassed if he won and we wasn't down," he said, imitating a =
Hillary supporter saying ruefully, "I had that white lady. What was I =
thinking?"<BR><BR>Obama also threw jabs at Clinton, not mentioning her =
name but saying he was a candidate who wouldn't have to explain why he =
voted to authorize the war in Iraq.<BR><BR>He alluded to the partisan =
wars of the 1990s and the 2000 election, saying "I don't want to pit red =
states against blue states. I want to lead the United States of =
America."<BR><BR>The trip to the Apollo sends a signal to Clinton that =
Obama intends to compete with her on her home turf -- and not just in =
New York, but in Harlem, where support for the New York senator is =
strong. Bill Clinton maintains his office a few blocks from the Apollo, =
and Hillary Clinton has the support of many of Harlem's leaders, =
including Rep. Charles Rangel.<BR><BR>Thursday, Obama seemed to be =
courting a Harlem endorsement of his own -- that of the Rev. Al =
Sharpton, who shared chicken and corn bread with Obama at Sylvia's =
Restaurant before his speech.<BR><BR>During the meal, Sharpton said he =
had not yet endorsed anyone, "but a man that likes chicken and corn =
bread can't be that bad."<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>=0A=
