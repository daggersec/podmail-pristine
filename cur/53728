Stop the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline: Tell Secretary Clinton to do a thorough environmental review of this dangerous project: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=hUH9msnBkHig_eCz4AEvng .


John,

Tell the State Department to do a strong environmental review of this dirty project:http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=jWoEuGDWuLFnL4GNOpZ3zA .

This is it. For more than a year, we've worked together to stage protests, grab media attention, educate our legislators and communities, and send hundreds of thousands of messages to stop the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline - and the Obama Administration has listened! They rejected this dangerous project and promised us that the State Department would do a full review of the environmental impacts of this dirty pipeline should it come up again.

Now TransCanada is back with a new proposal to build this disastrous pipeline, so it's time for the State Department to make good on their promise. And we need your help to make sure they do.

Tell Secretary Clinton to stop the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline by fully accounting for the disastrous effects that this dirty project could have on our lands, water, air, climate and communities: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=bIF_hYrF80Cb-3aLtYdZUw .

The last time that the State Department did this type of review - before President Obama wisely rejected the risky pipeline - they came up way short. They claimed that this project would have "no significant impact" on the nearby environment
even though all kinds of studies have shown that there will be major environmental consequences if we allow this dirty pipeline to be built. This time around, they can change their tune, but only if we call on them to give us a totally new and thorough investigation.

Write to Secretary Clinton now to tell her that we need a fresh and strong environmental review: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=YI_VGoY33AXOM4SGNREWJA .

It's time for our government to reject this dangerous project once and for all. We know that this dirty pipeline would put the water supply of millions of Americans at risk, hasten the destruction of Canada's boreal forest, and accelerate harmful climate change since tar sands create even more global warming pollution than traditional oil production - without lowering gas prices or increasing U.S. energy security. With the effects of climate change already causing hardship to families across America, we simply can't afford to let this disastrous project through. But if we want the State Department to acknowledge these facts and say no to this destructive pipeline, we need to speak out NOW.

Will you join us in asking Secretary Clinton to stand up to Big Oil and protect our communities?

This is our best chance to win this fight. So thank you for taking action and forwarding our message on to your friends and family today.

Best,
