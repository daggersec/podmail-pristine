John -=20

I joined the U.S. Army as a Calvary Scout in August of 2001, one month =
before the attacks on September 11th.=20

I served a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo and later deployed to Iraq as a =
Brigade sniper on counter IED and counter mortar missions.  I performed =
over 160 combat missions without the use of an armored vehicle, engaged in =
countless firefights, and survived dozens of ambushes.

My transition back to civilian life was challenging. I struggled with =
intrusive thoughts, anxiety, depression, and more. But I found peace in =
the outdoors -- camping, hiking, and exploring natural wonders became a =
way of life.

That's why I support legislation granting free lifetime access to our =
national parks for veterans, and I'm asking you to join me.=20

Add your name to mine and tell Congress: Support legislation that would =
provide veterans free access to public parks.=20

http://action.votevets.org/free-access

Currently, to enjoy a lifetime pass on these lands, a veteran requires a =
disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

There are millions of veterans with a service connected disability, but =
too often some choose not to file claims or even visit the VA after =
returning home.=20

Free access to our nation's parks and federal recreational lands would =
definitely give many of them incentive to get outdoors for what would be a =
very therapeutic experience. A 2013 University of Michigan study backs =
that claim up. They found a link between outdoor activity and long-term =
psychological well-being among veterans. =20

That's why this idea is so important. Add your name to mine and tell =
Congress to pass legislation providing veterans free access to public =
parks.

http://action.votevets.org/free-access

Veterans swore an oath to make the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the =
lands we love. We shouldn't have to pay again at the front gate.=20

It's time for Congress to act.

All the best,
