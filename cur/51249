Dear John,

There is no denying: the election in Massachusetts was a disappointment.=A0=
 However, let us not focus on our disappointment but rather, redouble our c=
ommitment to fighting for the causes and values that are so important.=A0 I=
 can tell you that the voters are not looking for a year of gridlock or mon=
ths of excuses and hand-wringing between now and the election.=A0 Voters wa=
nt action.=A0 They want solutions to the challenges they face.=A0 And they =
want hardworking leaders who are prepared to deliver.

That is what I have done.=A0 I have fought tooth and nail for President Oba=
ma's health care bill, which will provide coverage for 2.7 million New York=
ers.=A0 I've worked hand-in-hand with the President to invest in job creati=
on and bring home New York's fair share of federal dollars.=A0 And I've wor=
ked with all of you, traveling to all 62 counties in the state, listening t=
o your concerns, making your voice heard in Washington, and building a camp=
aign operation that is ready to win.

This is the kind of hardworking leadership I have always provided.

From my first race against entrenched Republican Congressman John Sweeney, =
when very few people thought he could be beaten, to my reelection against m=
ulti-millionaire former New York State GOP Chairman, Sandy Treadwell, which=
 was the most expensive Congressional race in the country, I have always be=
en outspent, but I have never been outworked.

On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day this week, I thought about his words: "Histo=
ry will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social t=
ransition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling =
silence of the good people."

National, state and local Republicans are aggressively plotting to try and =
capture a Senate seat from New York.=A0 To date, we have raised over $7.1 m=
illion to ensure we have the resources to compete with the Republican attac=
ks.=A0 I am prepared for the fight and I am prepared to win.=A0 If we conti=
nue to work together, speak out, and stay focused on solving the challenges=
 we face, New Yorkers will cast their vote for hardworking leadership and w=
e will deliver the change voters are still demanding.

It is an honor to work hard for the people of this state, and I thank you f=
or your service and your support.

Sincerely,
Kirsten=20
