Grassley, in June 2009:


GRASSLEY: "But when it comes to states requiring it for automobile insuranc=
e, the principle then ought to lie the same way for health insurance. Becau=
se everybody has some health insurance costs, and if you aren't insured, th=
ere's no free lunch. Somebody else is paying for it....I believe that there=
 is a bipartisan consensus to have individual mandates."
http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/09/18/grassley-mandate/

Grassley Develops New Opposition To Individual Mandate, Proposes Re-Insuran=
ce Scheme<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/09/18/grassley-mandate/>


Sen. Max Baucus's health care mark appeases top-line Republican concerns<ht=
tp://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/09/17/republicans-oppose-sfc/>. Under =
the mark, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for coverage, federal fund=
s cannot be used for abortion and the public option is no more (the list go=
es on here<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/09/17/republicans-oppose-=
sfc/>). But many Republicans are still raising the same stale objections; s=
ome are even inventing new reasons to oppose the legislation.

Yesterday, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) reiterated his concern about undocume=
nted workers being eligible for coverage and public dollars being spent on =
abortions. Grassley has also developed a new-found opposition to the indivi=
dual mandate - a policy that even health insurers support:

HEMMER: Now as I understand it, you want stronger language preventing feder=
al funds from going to abortion. You want stronger language to make sure il=
legal immigrants are not covered. If you got those two big points, would yo=
u go for it?

GRASSLEY: No, there are other points as well, but let me mention other poin=
ts that you didn't mention. And one would be the individual mandate, which =
for the first time would have a federal penalty against people who don't ha=
ve health insurance. I could do that through re-insurance and risk pools, t=
o make sure we get more people insured in a voluntary way and I'm very relu=
ctant to go along with an individual mandate.

Watch it:

But just last month, when asked "how does this bipartisan group that you`re=
 a member of get to more health insurance coverage if you don`t mandate tha=
t employers provide coverage," Grassley replied "through an individual mand=
ate and that`s individual responsibility and even Republicans believe in in=
dividual responsibility."

During a June appearance on Fox News Sunday, Grassley said, "there isn't an=
ything wrong with it [an individual mandate], except some people look at it=
 as an infringement upon individual freedom":

But when it comes to states requiring it for automobile insurance, the prin=
ciple then ought to lie the same way for health insurance. Because everybod=
y has some health insurance costs, and if you aren't insured, there's no fr=
ee lunch. Somebody else is paying for it....I believe that there is a bipar=
tisan consensus to have individual mandates.

During yesterday's interview however, Grassley found fault in the "automobi=
le insurance" analogy, explaining to host Bill Hemmer that "owning a car an=
d driving a car are voluntary, you don't have to do it...in this particular=
 case every American would have to have insurance or you would have a penal=
ty," he said.

Hypocrisy aside, Grassley's 'reinsurance scheme,' along with his abortion a=
nd immigration objections, are simply wrong headed. Grassley would replace =
the individual mandate with reinsurance. To make-up for the cost of individ=
uals who would only buy coverage once they become sick (and remember, under=
 insurance reform, insurers would have to accept all applicants, regardless=
 of pre-existing conditions), Grassley would allow insurers to pay into a "=
reinsurance fund" that would finance very high medical expenses. This way, =
he would protect the entire insurance pool from picking up the costs of ind=
ividuals who purchase coverage after a crippling diagnosis.

This makes sense in the short term, but on the whole it's bad policy. We sp=
end about75% of our health care dollars managing chronic diseases<http://ww=
w.fightchronicdisease.org/news/pfcd/pressrelease06012007.cfm> and comparati=
vely little on preventing individuals from developing those diseases in the=
 first place. Grassley's initiative, in other words, would not do anything =
to catch folks on the front end of the illness, (like the mandate would) an=
d fail to lower costs over the long term.

The abortion piece is no less peculiar. The Baucus mark preserves current p=
olicy by preventing federal money from funding so-called 'elective abortion=
s' - abortions in cases of incest, life, or rape would still be covered. Th=
e mark forbids women from using subsidy dollars for abortion services and f=
orces them to finance the procedure with private money. But Grassley is sug=
gesting, like Tony Perkins does here<http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.=
php?n=3D17149>, that a woman who wants to buy a benefits package that inclu=
des abortion services, should not receive any federal assistance- even if s=
he's using those dollars for unrelated services. In other words, women who =
purchase comprehensive packages - that include abortion services - must pay=
 for the entire cost of the package (even if they qualify for subsidies).
