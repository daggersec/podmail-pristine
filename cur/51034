John --

I hope you're well. Today was my last day at the White House -- I'm
starting Monday as head of public affairs at APCO Worldwide's D.C. office
-- so I was very relieved to get in under the wire the launch of our
"release to one is a release to all" FOIA pilots at 7 agencies.

It's been 5 months since you facilitated the Denis meeting that kicked off
the process that led to this. And it was an extremely hard thing to push
through the EOP--much, much harder than it should have been.

Megan Smith and Beth Cobert and Alex Macgillivray and Jason Miller and
Geovette Washington all played key roles at different times that pulled it
back from the brink amid suspicion and occasional hostility from Counsel
and Comms. But we couldn't have done it without your initial crucial push,
and for that many people who care about good government are today grateful.

Here's the Post story that ran this morning:
White House to make public records more public
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2015/07/10/white-house-=
to-make-public-records-more-public/>

By Lisa Rein

The law that=E2=80=99s supposed to keep citizens in the know
<http://www.foia.gov/> about
what their government is doing is about to get more robust.

Starting this week, seven agencies =E2=80=94 including the Environmental Pr=
otection
Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence =E2=80=94  l=
aunched
a new effort to put online the records they distribute to requesters under
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

So if a journalist, nonprofit group or corporation asks for the records,
what they see, the public also will see. Documents still will be redacted
where necessary to protect what the government decides is sensitive
information, an area that=E2=80=99s often disputed but won=E2=80=99t change=
 with this
policy.

The Obama administration=E2=80=99s new Open Government initiative began qui=
etly on
the agencies=E2=80=99 Web sites days after FOIA=E2=80=99s 49th anniversary.=
 It=E2=80=99s a response
to years of pressure from open-government groups and lawmakers to boost
public access to records of government decisions, deliberations and
policies.

The =E2=80=9Crelease to one is release to all=E2=80=9D policy will start as=
 a six-month
pilot at the EPA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the
Millennium Challenge Corporation and within some offices at the Department
of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, the Justice Department and
the National Archives and Records Administration.

(The EPA has been publishing its FOIA responses online since 2013).

=E2=80=9CWe=E2=80=99re very excited about the idea behind this and the prem=
ise of moving
the ball forward on public access,=E2=80=9D said Melanie Ann Pustay
<http://www.justice.gov/oip/meet-director>, director of the Office of
Information Policy at the Justice Department, which is leading the effort.
<http://releasetoall@usdoj.gov/>

An announcement on the Defense Department Web site says the agency
=E2=80=9Cinvites the public=E2=80=99s feedback as we explore this proposed =
policy shift,
and welcome innovative ideas and suggestions for overcoming the
implementation challenges.=E2=80=9D

Federal agencies received 714,231 requests for records under FOIA in fiscal
2014, up from 514,541 in fiscal 2009. But policies on publicizing the
information have varied widely, with some agencies not posting anything
online and others waiting until at least three people or organizations
request the same records to make them public.

=E2=80=9CMost agencies have interpreted that very narrowly and they don=E2=
=80=99t put up
much,=E2=80=9D said Patrice McDermott
<http://www.openthegovernment.org/taxonomy/term/1137>, executive director
of OpenTheGovernment.org,
<http://www.openthegovernment.org/taxonomy/term/1137> a coalition of
nonprofit groups seeking wider government transparency and public-records
access that pushed for the new policy.

McDermott acknowledged that some journalists and researchers were concerned
that =E2=80=9Cthey could be scooped=E2=80=9D if their record requests go pu=
blic, but she
said they concluded that access was the priority.

=E2=80=9CThe best thing is that the administration is moving forward with w=
hat will
be a significant benefit to the public, without being required to by
Congress.=E2=80=9D

The new policy will exempt from wider public view requests individuals
make for their own records.

Federal agencies are struggling to keep up with a growing number of
requests for public information, raising questions in Congress about the
Obama administration=E2=80=99s dedication to transparency.

The backlog of unfulfilled requests for documents has doubled since
President Obama took office in 2009, according to Justice Department data.
The number of requests also has spiked.

The new policy won=E2=80=99t affect that backlog; in fact, administration o=
fficials
acknowledge that it could slow the production of records given agencies=E2=
=80=99
new responsibilities to post the information online. Of the 714,231
requests in fiscal 2014, 647,000 were filled, according to federal data.
About 60 percent of those were released in full or denied partially.

Open-government advocates and administration officials said there
was resistance to the change partly because of the administrative burden;
records must be accessible to the visually impaired, and special software
is required to code graphs and other elements of records into readable
documents.

Other unresolved questions include how much staff time it will take to scan
the documents.

=E2=80=9CSome records are thousands of pages long and need to be coded so t=
hey=E2=80=99re
accessible to the disabled,=E2=80=9D Pustay said. =E2=80=9CWe love the conc=
ept of this, but
there are lots of different challenges."

McDermott said some agency officials =E2=80=9Chad concerns about informatio=
n
getting into the hands of people who don=E2=80=99t have the context of it,=
=E2=80=9D and
using it against the White House.

Congress came one floor vote away last year from passing bipartisan
open-government legislation in the Senate and the House, but lawmakers ran
out of time as they rushed to reach agreement on spending legislation.

Sens. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) two of the
staunchest advocates for strengthening open-records laws, reintroduced
legislation early this year to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act.

But those bills do not address the effort underway now to make the records
more accessible.
