This morning, Campaign Money Watch sent a letter to McCain campaign manager,
Rick Davis, urging them to answer pending questions about transactions
between Tom Loeffler=B9s lobbying firm and a full-time employee of the McCai=
n
campaign, fundraiser Susan Nelson. The key sections of the letter is here:

=20
It is a violation of federal election law to allow a corporation to pay the
salaries of campaign workers. We hope the McCain campaign takes this matter
seriously enough to provide a response.

Later today, we=B9ll issue a web ad. I think you=B9ll like it.
