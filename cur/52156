Team,

We have a call at 1pm CT today to discuss the tick-tock for tomorrow.
There are three important things I wanted to flag in advance:

1. Because of the outstanding work of Matt, Michael, Michelle and our
INCREDIBLE organizing team in Iowa, tomorrow could be an important
opportunity to reinforce fundamental strengths of our campaign--that HRC
listened to Iowans, earned their support by proposing realistic plans to
deliver real results, and worked hard to build the biggest grassroots
organization in Iowa caucus history to turn out her supporters.
This is a valuable opportunity to reinforce our overall path to victory in
the primary.  The Iowa team has created a great tick-tock of
up-to-the-minute organizing and turnout numbers we can use to set up this
argument tomorrow.  One of our most important objectives on our 1pm call is
to all align around this plan.  Stay tuned!

2. There will be a staff room at HRC's hotel tomorrow night that IS open to
everyone on this email but NOT open to others (HRC/WJC will be there), so
PLEASE keep it's existence a well-guarded secret!  We are asking that
everyone who is not staffing the hotline or the field operations center
depart HQ tomorrow by 6pm...so plan to be at the hotel at that time.

3. We will have an official email chain set up tomorrow with this group to
provide ongoing status updates starting at 6pm.  As everyone knows, the
caucuses happen FAST...we will probably have a decent picture of turnout
between 7:15-7:30 and an idea of the outcome 7:30-8pm.  We will send live
updates on the email chain but they are NOT for public consumption unless
expressly noted in the email.  The purpose of the chain is to keep us, HRC,
and WJC updated in real time.

If you have any questions, we can discuss on the call.
