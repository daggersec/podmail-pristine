Seniors all across the country rely on Medicare to pay for life-saving =
medications and procedures.

Despite its success, Paul Ryan and his allies have been trying to destroy =
today's Medicare as we know it.

Ann won't stand for that. And neither will we. Sign the pledge to protect =
Medicare:

John --

49 years ago, Medicare was signed into law.

It was a big day for our nation, to provide health care for our seniors =
who worked hard their whole lives.

But for the last four years, conservatives in Congress have forgotten this =
fact and have done everything they can to replace Medicare with a health =
insurance coupon.

Our seniors deserve better. That's why Ann is joining her colleagues =
across the country to stand strong for seniors and preserve traditional =
Medicare. John, will you join the pledge?

Medicare >>
