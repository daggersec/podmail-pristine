Dear Jake,

I would like to suggest an idea to try to clear the deck of Sanders, by win=
ning Iowa and New Hampshire. Just after the New Year, Hillary should litera=
lly live in the two states, staying at the homes of supporters or in inexpe=
nsive hotels, as Jimmy Carter did in 1976. She could have her friends host =
small,intimate events in their homes, in addition to larger venues. The vot=
ers of those two states value and expect personal, hands-on contact. The su=
rprise element would reverberate nationally, and help remove an air of enti=
tlement.

Best wishes,

Stu=
