Dear editor of the LA  Times,

It is one thing to lose your freedom  and be incarcerated in a stinking 
nursing home, it is another thing to hear that  you are sharing your sacrifice 
with the rest of the citizens of  California.  There is no shared sacrifice 
in this budget; unless you mean  shared by the people who are least able to 
shoulder it.  What is  countrywide home loans sharing in this financial 
crisis?  How are their  corporate property taxes doing. Where is the sacrifice 
of the predatory  mortgage lenders in this California budget crisis?.
    I sat in Governor Schwarzenegger's office and got  sent a lie in 
person, that during the midterm election when the propositions  were voted down by 
the people that we all spoke and said that we didn't want to  raise 
revenues.  This was a lie.  When I voted in that election I was  voting that the 
money for the mentally ill not be taken away from them.  I  also voted the 
poor children should not have their budget taken from  them. I also didn't vote 
for a rainy day fund because I thought there was  no rainier day than now.  
And most of us voted not propositions because we  thought we shouldn't be 
asked to vote for them because we couldn't see these  propositions in 
context. That was the job of legislators.  
    Nobody asked me about a cigarette tax or a beer tax  or paying $15 more 
when I registered my car each year.  Nobody asked me  about those increases 
or any number of other modest revenues that could have  been handled 
reasonably comfortably by most of us and certainly in a state that  is home to 
more millionaires than a place in the world. I have so many working  friends 
who say they wouldn't have minded paying $15 more in vehicle license  fees so 
that they wouldn't see their brothers and sisters sleeping under a  bridge 
or young people delayed in their ability to move forward in their lives  by 
canceling school.  I would've paid $200 more, and I live on Social  Security.
 
    Every other state in the nation dealt with this  recession with a 
combination of budget cuts and revenues-- except the state of  California.  
California home to more millionaires than any other place in  the world, where wo
rking people and wealthy people were not even asked to say  the most modest 
of revenue increases.  The Governor said that our voices  were heard in that 
we didn't want any new revenues and I think that's just a  lie.  You can't 
draw that conclusion from the midterm elections.
 
      This crisis was brought on by predatory  lenders who poisoned the 
global fund of money while making hand over fist by  selling junk mortgages to 
people couldn't afford them.  And now when they  been given billions of 
dollars of tax money to restructure those mortgages I  don't hear about 
anybody's mortgage being bailed out by any bank.
 
    We have allowed a minority of legislators to hold  the state hostage 
and prevent any reasonable revenues from being raised to keep  from destroying 
the safety net that will soon have blood beneath it.  I  personally will 
follow any person to a nursing home who loses their home care  from this 
budget.  I can't stay home while a brother or sister with a  disability or a 
senior citizen has their freedom taken away from them anymore  than I could 
stand idly by in Germany when people were taken away to  camps.  And the cherry 
on top as it will cost taxpayers six times as much  money to yank that 
senior citizen out of their home and put them in a stinking  hellhole.

Make no mistake, something very evil is  going on in the state of 
California right now.  All the most vulnerable  people are going to suffer and some 
suffer greatly.  It's one thing to be  heartless it's another thing to 
whisper lies to people as you usher them from  their homes and into the 
institutions and their new homes on the  street.

Most  sincerely,

Nancy Becker  Kennedy
member and former vice chair of the Personal  Assistance Services Council 
that oversees the in-home care of 180,000 seniors  and people with 
disabilities.
