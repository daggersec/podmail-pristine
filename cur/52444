Our SuperPAC board currently consists of Harold Ickes, and Greg Speed from =
America Votes, and we have one vacancy.  I think a total of 7-10 is probabl=
y ideal.  Aside from our esteemed new co-chairs, we discussed the following=
 as possible additions:

Stephanie Schriock=20
Mayor Julian Castro
=20
I am culling the list of speakers from the convention which may also provid=
e some good, representative options.  Please think of people who would be g=
ood and send me suggestions by Monday.  I will compile suggestions and we c=
an set a call to discuss options and dole out assignments. =20
