Dear All,

With apologies for overburdening your inbox, I must clarify: the reading fo=
r the first faculty seminar on the Meaning of a Case, (wednesday, February =
4th) led by Professor Brooks, is the "Wolfman" case in Freud's book, Three =
Case Histories.  That's the last of the three essays contained in the book.

Many thanks,

Robin
