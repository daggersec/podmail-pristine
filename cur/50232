On May 21st, 2013, Progress Florida celebrated their 5th anniversary
and took the opportunity to reflect on the progress made in their
state! With the help of an online network of more than 100,000
grassroots activists, and countless allied organizations, Progress
Florida has truly been able to strengthen the progressive movement.
They have successfully defeated a number of anti-middle class
proposals, effectively mobilized voters against extremist right wing
candidates, and ensured some of Florida's worst abusers of the
public trust were held accountable.

Take a look at the interactive timeline highlighting Progress
Florida's success over the past five years.
http://progressnow.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DWfO4sUwrAn4-A5Mi5vV7KQ

Progress Florida is using their 5th anniversary as a way to assess
where progress still needs to be made. Too many Floridians have been
forced out of the middle class by misguided, heavily flawed policies
driven by Tea Party ideology and corporate special interests. Our
children deserve a real and lasting investment in their education. All
Floridians deserve a right to health care because no one should go
bankrupt simply because they get sick. Unchecked developers and the
threat of climate change are putting our precious land and water
resources at risk more than ever before. And we can't stop being
vigilant when it comes to our civil rights, particularly voting
rights. For the past five years we have been able to make progress
because of your support and we ask for your continued support moving
forward. Please donate today to help us gear up for the next five
years!
