Subject: Helms Amendment

I wanted to weigh in on a policy issue that I have heard (from the women=B9s
health advocates) that the WH is considering.  I have also heard that after
listening to the strong concerns of the advocates, this may not be going
forward, but because I am getting all my information third hand (through
Planned Parenthood=B9s reports on their conversations with Tina Tchen), I
thought worth sending you a quick email.

The groups have been advocating for changing the Helms Amendment to add
exceptions for life of the mother, rape or incest (in other words, to
clarify that despite the longstanding interpretation of Helms, while US
dollars can=B9t be spent for abortion =B3as a method of family planning=B2 =8B thes=
e
cases are not family planning.)  The groups heard recently that the WH was
prepared to go forward, but with two notable limitations.  First, that any
organization with a religious or moral objection would not be required to
provide, pay for or refer for abortion.  Second, that an organization that
does not provide abortion services could not be discriminated against in th=
e
solicitation, application or granting of foreign assistance funds.

Both of these pose problems, and in my view, leaving Helms intact is a
better alternative at the moment.  The conscience clause is at best odd and
at worst harmful.  Changing Helms would not require grantees to provide
abortions at all =8B it would simply say that US funds can legally be spent i=
n
certain limited circumstances (life, rape, incest) and only in countries
where abortion is legal.  Since there is no affirmative requirement, why
introduce the notion of a conscience exception?  (One fact I don=B9t have, an=
d
can=B9t from outside the government figure out, is what if any conscience
exceptions currently exist in US foreign assistance internal policy).  In
addition, the non-discrimination clause could be problematic.  Again, there
is no affirmative requirement that these services be offered so
organizations that don=B9t provide them don=B9t need a leg up in the applicatio=
n
process.  (I=B9d even go one step further to argue that if Helms were amended
so that abortions could be paid for in cases of rape, that factor should be
considered in the application =8B given the reality that in many parts of the
world, the USAID grantee is going to be the only health care available, and
in some of those places (e.g., DRC) the availability of abortion in the cas=
e
of a rape might be important.)

These changes are a problem =8B as a matter of substance and also as a matter
of politics (including for H).  As I said, my intelligence suggests that th=
e
groups have effectively stopped this from going forward, but I wanted to be
sure you are aware.  Happy to talk to anyone further about this if it is
helpful.

Thanks as always,
Jen

P.S.  Would still love your eyes on the No Ceilings policy agenda.  If you
are willing, perhaps I should send you the most recent version after Friday=
?
