When is 5 + 5 greater than 10??
=20
When 7 are listed in The Best Lawyers in America (including 3 for bet-the-c=
ompany litigation), 6 ?are listed as Local Litigation Stars in Benchmark Li=
tigation, ?and 8 are listed in Super Lawyers. ?
=20
When they have a total of more than 185 trials under their belts. ?
=20
When 7 are former judicial law clerks, including 1 for the U.S. Supreme Cou=
rt and ??5 for appellate courts. ?
=20
When the 10 combine the lawyers at Murphy & Shaffer LLC with the ?Baltimore=
 lawyers at national ?litigation boutique Zuckerman Spaeder LLP.?
=20
The five attorneys from Murphy & Shaffer LLC add more than just numbers to =
Zuckerman ?Spaeder's ?Baltimore office. Partners William J. Murphy, ?Robert=
 T. Shaffer, and John J. ?Connolly, and associates Daniel P. Moylan and Con=
or B. ?O'Croinin add depth and experience to ?the firm's nationally recogni=
zed commercial litigation and ?white collar criminal defense practices.?
=20
With 10 experienced litigators in Baltimore, in addition to 70 attorneys in=
 three ?other offices, ?Zuckerman Spaeder is well positioned to take on eve=
n more complex, high-stakes litigation in ??Maryland and around the country=
. ?"The addition of this group of ?superb litigators enhances our ?ability =
to represent clients in litigation of any size or ?complexity," said Martin=
 S. Himeles Jr., ?managing ?partner of Zuckerman's Baltimore office. ?
=20
"Baltimore has always been a vital part of Zuckerman Spaeder's national lit=
igation presence," said Graeme W. Bush, chairman of Zuckerman Spaeder. "The=
 lawyers in our Baltimore office not only litigate important cases in Balti=
more, they are full members of our high-stakes litigation team at the natio=
nal level. The five lawyers joining us from another of Baltimore's most res=
pected litigation firms will give Zuckerman Spaeder an even more formidable=
 local presence and even greater depth nationally."
