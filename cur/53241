here it is -
"Like other global charities, the Clinton Foundation receives support from
individuals, organizations and governments from all over the
world.  Contributions are made because of a strong belief that the
Foundation's programs improve the lives of millions of people around the
globe.  The Clinton Foundation has a record of transparency that goes above
what is required of U.S. charities, including peer organizations.   This
includes the voluntary disclosure of contributions on the Foundation's
website.  Should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office, we will
continue to ensure the Foundation's policies and practices regarding
support from international partners are appropriate, just as we did when
she served as Secretary of State.=E2=80=9D
