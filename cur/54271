>>> I was on my first trip to New Hampshire this spring, in a Keene bakery,
>>> when a retired doctor spoke up. I had just announced I was running for

y
>>> from voters about their concerns, their hopes, and their vision for the
>>> future. He said his biggest worry was the rising tide of heroin addicti=
on
>>> in the state, the result of a wave of prescription drug abuse. He said
>>> hospitals were seeing more babies born addicted, that police officers w=
ere
>>> responding to more overdoses, that families were being torn apart.
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>> To be candid, I didn=E2=80=99t expect what came next. In several states=
, this
>>> issue crept up again and again =E2=80=93 from so many people, from all =
walks of
>>> life, in small towns and big cities.
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>> In Iowa, from Davenport to Council Bluffs, people spoke to me about met=
h

 a

ons

>>> than getting the treatment they needed.
>>>
>>>
>>>
>>> These stories shine light on some harrowing statistics. Nearly 23
>>> million Americans suffer from addiction, but in 2014, only 2.5 million =
were
>>> able to receive treatment at a specialized facility. Fifty-two million
>>> Americans over the age of 12 have abused prescription drugs, including =
one

>>>
>>>

>>> Enough is enough. It=E2=80=99s time we recognize as a nation that we ha=

ion
>>> drug monitoring program before providing opiates.
>>>
>>>

>>> Achieving these goals won=E2=80=99t be easy. It=E2=80=99s going to take=

said his biggest worry was the rising tide of heroin addiction in the state=

Nearly 23 million Americans suffer from addiction, but in 2014, only 2.5 mi=
