Hey, thanks, John, and looking forward.

Any chance we can pencil in a time --  Wednesday the 9th, or perhaps Monday
the 11th?  Or, if neither of these, let me know what works for you.

Cheers,
Erika

PS Hope didn't create an issue with sending to your 'other' address. (I
didn't have the other or a way to take a good guess.)
