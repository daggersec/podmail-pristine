John --

Every year, our family tries to come up with a fun way to wish Barack a =
happy birthday.

And this August 4th, when he turns 49, I have something new in mind.

This has been a big -- and hectic -- year for him. After signing the =
Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform into law -- and completing his =
first year as president -- I think it's safe to say we will remember it =
for a long time.

And I know full well how much he credits this movement, and the work of =
supporters like you, for the change that we've accomplished.

So I'm putting together a birthday card that I would like you to sign. =
Together with other Organizing for America supporters -- and me, Malia, =
Sasha, and Bo -- we'll wish him a happy birthday and let him know that =
we're ready to take on the year ahead alongside him.

Will you wish Barack a happy birthday with me?

http://my.barackobama.com/birthday6

This year also brought a lot of surprises -- some good and some bad.

Supporters like you have helped him make the best of it -- by contacting =
Congress to help push stalled legislation forward, by re-engaging =
supporters in the political process, by giving back with service projects =
across the country, and so much more.

And while we can't know what the coming year will bring, all of us, =
working together, will continue pushing forward for change.

Will you help make this a memorable birthday for Barack and wish him a =
happy 49th?

Thanks so much,

Michelle Obama
