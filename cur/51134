=20
Time to Give Thanks for Profiles in Political  Courage=20

A lot has been written by the pundits about the Democrats who lost their =
=20
House seats in the mid-term elections.  =20
From some you hear that the Blue Dogs =96 and others from swing districts  =
--=20
did not do enough to prepare for the battle this fall =96 that they should=
=20
have  raised more money, or run more robust campaigns.=20
From some Progressives you actually hear that the House will be better  off=
=20
without so many Members representing moderate districts.=20
And from some conservatives you hear that Democrats representing moderate =
=20
districts were stupid to vote for measures like health care reform, energy =
=20
reform, the stimulus bill and even Wall Street reform. =20
This Thanksgiving, I want to thank those Democrats from moderate  districts=
=20
who voted to do what they thought was right for the country, even  though=
=20
they knew there might be negative short-term political consequences. They =
=20
are the true heroes who made possible some of the many important reforms th=
at =20
were enacted since President Obama was elected, and they deserve our=20
admiration  and thanks.  America needs  more political leaders who will do =
what is=20
best for the next generation, not  just the next election.=20
Let me be clear that I do not mean to imply that I think their support  for=
=20
any of these measures was a bad political decision.  Supporters of the Wall=
=20
Street reform  bill occupied, and continue to occupy, super high political=
=20
ground.  In fact, if Wall Street had been made a  bigger issue during the=
=20
recent campaign, most Democratic candidates =96 everywhere  =96 would have =
likely=20
received more votes. =20
And let us recall that the fundamental factor that cost Democrats control =
=20
of the House had nothing to do with any of these issues =96 but rather the=
=20
broad  anger about the state of the economy.=20
Remember that  in 2008, President Obama won the  votes of people who said=
=20
their personal economic situation had gotten worse by a  43 percent margin.=
=20
In 2010, Democrats lost those voters by 29 percent.  Those numbers tell the=
=20
story about what  really caused so many Democrats to lose.=20
The stimulus bill was not a net positive for Democrats in swing districts  =
=96
 as it should have been, since it helped prevent a depression.  But the=20
fact is that the one thing that  could have been done to truly diminish=20
Republican successes this fall would have  been passage of a much larger st=
imulus=20
package that was necessary to truly  jumpstart the economy.   Ironically, a=
t=20
the time the vote was taken, that would have been even  more politically=20
difficult for some of the Democrats who lost =96 though it may  have saved =
many=20
of them by Election Day. =20
Votes for the health care bill and energy reform certainly did little to =
=20
help many candidates in these districts =96 and may have further damaged a =
few=20
--  even though those votes were absolutely the right thing to do. =20
To make fundamental change, you anger those vested interests with a stake =
=20
in the status quo. And the most politically vulnerable often pay the price.=
 =20
It=92s not a new story.  In the mid-term elections following the  passage o=
f=20
Medicare and the other critical =93Great Society=94 programs of the  1960s,=
=20
Democrats lost 48 seats. But who among the Democratic Members of Congress =
=20
would have wanted his grandchildren to remember that he voted against  Medi=
care?=20
Progressives, in particular, often forget that it is much easier to stand =
=20
up straight for the progressive policies that are so critical for our natio=
n=92
s  future if you represent a heavily Democratic district. Like Medicare,=20
these  positions represent incredibly good politics over the long run prett=
y=20
much  everywhere, but in the short run it=92s easy for Republicans and thei=
r=20
corporate  allies to use some progressive votes as cudgels against Democrat=
s=20
who represent  more conservative districts like Southwest Virginia or Bucks=
=20
County, Pennsylvania. Of course, that is especially  true when you are not=
=20
constrained by the truth. =20
The health care bill is a particular case in point. Republicans and their =
=20
allies in the insurance industry spent millions distorting the provisions o=
f=20
the  bill =96 lying about =93Obamacare,=94  =93death panels=94 and =93the G=
overnment=20
 takeover of health care.=94  They used  the bill to inflame passions, and=
=20
channeled the anger about the economy at  Democrats instead of at Wall Stre=
et=20
and the policies of the Bush Administration  that lead to the 2008 economic=
=20
catastrophe.  They didn=92t just start attacking  Democrats a month or two=
=20
before the election.  The Chamber of Commerce, insurance  industry front=20
groups, and the other special interest hammered on Democrats who  voted for=
 the=20
bill for a solid eighteen months.=20
We went into the  day of the health care vote in the House six votes short,=
=20
and in the end, the  first major reform of the health care system -- since=
=20
Medicare -- passed with  just a two vote margin.  Had it not  been for=20
people like Tom Periello, Phil Hare, Steve Kagen, Dan Maffei, Betsy  Markey=
, Mary=20
Jo Kilroy, Pat Murphy =96 and many, many others -- that historic,  critical=
ly=20
important reform would never have been passed.  =20
It would have been easier =96 at least politically =96 for some of those =
=20
Members to vote no. But they didn=92t =96 and many of them have stood proud=
ly for =20
health care reform and the progressive agenda for their entire professional=
 =20
lives. Some Democrats that represented swing districts required some =20
arm-twisting to vote yes =96 but not most.  Most didn=92t have to be convin=
ced that =20
health care is a right.  They voted  aye because it was the right thing to=
=20
do.  A lot of the Members who lost earlier this month ran for Congress to d=
o=20
something =96 not be something.=20
The night of November 2nd, as she conceded defeat in her bid  for=20
re-election, Congresswoman Betsy Markey said: "This is where I end the disc=
ussion=20
about whether the policy of the  health care bill was worth the politics of=
 it.=20
It was. And I am uniquely  qualified to know that."=20
After the Health Care reform bill passed in the House, I saw Congressman  =
=96=20
and Doctor -- Steve Kagen getting his colleagues in the House to autograph=
=20
his  copy of the bill. He said: =93You know, this is what I came to Congres=
s=20
to do.=94 =20
Kagen ran  a terrific campaign.  He stood up  proudly for the progressive=
=20
agenda.  He framed his message in clear, populist, resonant terms.  He had =
a=20
massive get out the vote  operation. He was beaten by the bad economy and b=
y=20
the millions of dollars of  largely secret corporate money spent to drive=
=20
home the lie that the health care  reform bill had =93cut Medicare.=94 =20
Kagen, like many  of the other Democrats from moderate districts may be=20
back in 2012.  They deserve to be.  And this Thanksgiving they deserve our =
=20
thanks.=20
Robert Creamer is  a long-time political organizer and strategist, and=20
author of the recent  book:  Stand Up Straight: How  Progressives Can Win,=
=20
available on _Amazon.com._=20
