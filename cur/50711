John --

Over the past month, Tea Party Republicans gambled it all: our economy, =
critical community services that millions rely on, and the trust of the =
American people -- just to get their way.

And, my opponent, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling, wants nothing more than =
to distance himself from his friends in the Tea Party as he tries to =
remake himself and win back his seat. But he has a record.

Just look at the facts:

In 2011, Bobby Schilling stood with the Tea Party caucus and voted to shut =
down the government!
He backed Paul Ryan's Medicare-destroying budget and continues to defend =
this position to this day.
He penned his name on Todd Akin's bill to redefine rape.

Make no mistake, Bobby Schilling is cut from the same cloth as those who =
held the American economy hostage for 16 days. The last thing Illinois =
families need is him "representing" them again in Congress.

John, will you chip in $5 or whatever you can right now to help us take on =
Bobby Schilling and his Tea Party backers?

http://action.cheribustos.com/13-oct22-1

We've seen what happens when Tea Party politicians are put in charge. We =
can't let that happen in Illinois -- there's too much at stake.

Please, chip in what you can right now to help us spread the truth about =
Bobby Schilling and defeat him again in 2014.
