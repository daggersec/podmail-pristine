John:

In addition to the "from campaiging to governing" event that Peter tells me=
 you are excited about, Matt and Will Straw have put together a concept for=
 an international meeting at CAP a few weeks in advance of the G-20.  Idea =
is to have progressive international economic policy officials from key g_2=
0 countries come to CAP to discuss with each other a strategy for the upcom=
ing G-20 meeting. US officials ideally would engage with their fellow progr=
essives from around the world in advance and in "private."

I think the concept is flawed and my attempts to make it more realistic hav=
e met with only modest success.  They need senior level US gov't participan=
ts to promise to come -- to attract the european and other int'l level top =
participants.  The US gov't officials (eg some of the following:  Larry, La=
el, key USTR folks, Geitner and his Int'l Finance team):   (1) with excepti=
on of NEC/NSC may not yet be confirmed in time to make commitment in time t=
o be relevant to EU invites; and (2) why would they want to "pre-negotiate"=
 the G-20 meetings in a group setting at CAP.  Maybe Larry would come and g=
ive a speech, leave a staffer in the room to listen to the rest of the grou=
p talk among itselves.  Matt and Will argue that would be good for US gov't=
 folks to help inform them in developing their strategy for G-20 but I am a=
 bit sceptical they will welcome it.  If they do not, no point seems to me.

Matt is pushing hard.  Despite very good and constructive discussions at ou=
r last global progress meetings, there was palpable frustration on the part=
 of a number of the international economic officials (most notably the Aust=
railian and EU trade folks but more broadly) that Obama-land didn't particp=
ate in the earlier CAP meetings (or in any other meetings with them anywher=
e about trade and Doha).  Matt feels he can't raise money if CAP can't deli=
ver access to the new administration's team.

I am inclined to say that we should focus on the "from campaigning to gover=
ning" event for now -- and then when folks are in place in US a bit longer =
we'll be in better place to help deliver.  Matt may say impossible for him =
to raise money without more.  If you think CAP can deliver enough key trade=
/finance folks who will at least listen or speechify to make it possible to=
 attract top int'l participants, we can proceed on g-20 meeting also.

We're meeting later this week to decide.  Your input would be appreciated.

Sarah
