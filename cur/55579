I'd like to have a call/meeting over the weekend to go over names and
slots, get clear on who is doing what come Nov 5,  see who needs to be
moved along in the clearance process, make sure we are not missing
anything.  Don't think we need the policy teams at this point, but we
can add national security if you think wise.  Better to do the others
seperately.
Is Saturday afternoon or Sunday better for any of you?
