Earlier today, the NRSC -- the arm of the Republican Party charged with =
electing Republicans to the U.S. Senate -- sent out a tweet accusing Tammy =
Duckworth of not "standing up" for veterans.

Tammy Duckworth lost both of her legs when her Black Hawk helicopter was =
shot down over Iraq. She continued her service in the Illinois Army =
National Guard and worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs -- =
fighting for veterans -- for almost five years.

If you are as outraged at the NRSC's tweet as I am, make them pay: make a =
$3 contribution directly to Tammy Duckworth's campaign today.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/vv-for-duckworth

Mark Kirk has been relentlessly attacking Tammy as being soft on terror =
and not working for veterans. Your $3 contribution to Tammy Duckworth's =
campaign will send a powerful message that you've had ENOUGH of their =
swiftboat style attacks.

All my best,
