I'm the National Field Director for LCV. I just arrived here in Massachuset=
ts and I wanted you to know that we have a real shot to swing this Senate r=
ace.

In Massachusetts - where Elizabeth Warren is running against Senator Scott =
Brown -- LCV is running the largest field operation in the state. So far we=
've knocked on the doors of nearly 100,000 voters - and our goal is to hit =
half a million by Election Day.

With both candidates agreeing to a pledge to keep outside groups from adver=
tising in the race, we're focusing our efforts on this massive field operat=
ion to help Elizabeth Warren win on November 6th. Because Scott Brown was f=
irst elected in a low-turnout special election in early 2010, many of the v=
oters we're targeting will
be seeing his name on the ballot for the first time - which means our field=
 program is poised to have a significant impact on the outcome of this race=
.

These efforts could be the margin of victory in November - but we need your=
 help to do more.

Donate to LCV Victory Fund. We're just $38,565 away from our$120,000 goal b=
y the September 30th FEC deadline. Will you chip in to help us reach hundre=
ds of thousands of voters in battleground Senate races?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DBojsAnV4uYM9Dmlxa_kD_Q

Contrary to his campaign ads, Scott Brown has been anything but independent=
 or moderate on environmental issues. He earned a zero on LCV's National En=
vironmental Scorecard during his first year in the Senate. After two years,=
 his lifetime score on LCV's National Environmental Scorecard sits at a pal=
try 22 percent, nearly matching Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky score of 18 p=
ercent.

Given Scott Brown's disappointing environmental record - and Elizabeth Warr=
en's fierce commitment to fighting for the values that you and I share - th=
e stakes in Massachusetts are high. Warren has been rising in the polls the=
 past few weeks - and LCV's on-the-ground work is contributing to that mome=
ntum.=A0A massive ground game is how we win in Massachusetts - and in Senat=
e races across the country. But more importantly, a massive ground game is =
how we ensure that we have leaders in the Senate who will champion laws tha=
t protect our air, land and water and hold polluters accountable.

We're getting close to our goal. There are just five days left.=A0Will you =
help us reach $120,000 by making a donation today?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DrdS_lU_BcXHRuuYZCGsy0A

There's still work to get done. Luckily, we're getting a lot of incredible =
encouragement from voters in Massachusetts.=A0 And the momentum isn't just =
here in Massachusetts. I'm hearing the same level of enthusiasm from my col=
leagues in Virginia, Montana and many other battleground states - races tha=
t are just as close, where the choices we make now may decide who wins.

By October 1st, we need to make the final decisions about our field plans a=
nd where we are going to spend our resources. We want to make sure that we =
expand the playing field as much as possible and we don't miss a single opp=
ortunity.

Please don't miss this opportunity. Too much is at stake. Chip in with a gi=
ft to LCV Victory Fund today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DDZ2qjYqNBROS=
YMPLrieisA .

Thanks for all your support.
