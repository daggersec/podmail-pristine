Dear John, 

I wish we could brush off the extreme ideas being bandied about in Congress-from dismantling Medicare to taking away a woman's right to choose.

*But the fact is we can't. The hard right controls the House, and our Democratic majority in the Senate is all too slim. This means we have to do everything we can for our Democratic senators, particularly New York's own Kirsten Gillibrand.*

Kirsten has fought relentlessly for our priorities such as the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell; providing benefits to our 9/11 heroes; and protecting reproductive health care. We need her to continue the fight, and to strengthen our Democratic majority.

Grassroots support has always been key to Kirsten's campaigns, so I hope you'll come forward today and be a part of her 2012 re-election. The June 30 fundraising deadline is quickly approaching, and Kirsten needs to raise $100,000. Can she count on you?

*Click here to contribute $250, $500 or more to Kirsten's campaign today and help her raise $100,000 by June 30. We need Kirsten in the Senate to fight against the GOP's radical ideas.* [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/1097/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=11531 ]

I'm proud to serve alongside all of my Democratic partners in the U.S. Senate. But Kirsten is something truly special.

*Over the past two and a half years, Kirsten has distinguished herself as a leader who possesses the strength and courage to push through crucial legislation. *As things really start to heat up in Congress, she is exactly who we need to lead the charge against extremism and for progressivism.

But just as we recognize Kirsten as a critical advocate in our fight to push this country forward, the GOP sees her as a threat to their plans to roll back our progress. They know that with Kirsten around, it will be that much harder to eradicate the EPA, line the pockets of Big Oil and repeal health care reform.

In their desperate attempt to take control of the Senate, Republicans are looking for signs of weakness among all Democratic senators. Let's make sure they continue to see Kirsten as a strong, capable opponent who has the resounding support of her grassroots allies.

*Click here to make your contribution of $250, $500 or more today and help Kirsten reach her goal of raising $100,000 by June 30. We simply can't let the Republicans get a hold of Kirsten's seat.* [ https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/1097/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=11531 ]

With your help, I know Kirsten will win in 2012. So please, act now and show her you'll be there for her.

Sincerely,

Chuck Schumer
