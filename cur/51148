Hello --

As we celebrate Memorial Day, I hope you'll take a moment with your fam=
ily to honor the brave men and women who paid the ultimate sacrifice in=
 service of our country=2E

I also hope you'll reflect on the special place our Commonwealth has as=
 the birthplace of this great nation as well as the soil that held it t=
ogether=2E

At Valley Forge, starvation, disease, and exposure killed nearly 2,500 =
American soldiers -- and General Washington credited their sacrifice an=
d the hardship of that winter as the pivotal moment that bonded the Con=
tinental Army together and made it the force that won the war=2E

And at Gettysburg, more than 7,800 Americans perished on Pennsylvania s=
oil in the turning point of the Civil War=2E

On Saturday, I honored Civil War soldiers buried at Montgomery Cemetery=
 in Montgomery County, including General Winfield Scott Hancock and Gen=
eral John Frederick Hartranft, a Medal of Honor recipient who later bec=
ame the 19th Governor of Pennsylvania=2E

These soldiers, and the unsung heroes who fought beside them, give us a=
n example of what it means to be American, what it means to fight for d=
emocracy, of what it means to believe in something bigger than oneself=2E

No matter when or where their sacrifice took place we should give thank=
s for the bravery of the fine men and women who went to war from the ba=
ttlefields of Pennsylvania to the shores of Normandy to the jungles of =
Vietnam to the sands of the Middle East and gave their lives for a caus=
e bigger than them -- our freedom and democracy=2E

Whether you mark this Memorial Day at one of these historical sites, ho=
st a barbecue, or play at the beach, please take a moment to reflect an=
d remember their bravery=2E

On the Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier in Philadelphia th=
ere is an engraving that reads, "Freedom is a light for which many men =
have died in darkness=2E"

On Memorial Day, we bring their memory back into the light=2E

Thank you,

Josh Shapiro
