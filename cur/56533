T.M.I.

Rep. Jim Moran, a Democrat from the 8th District of Virginia, sponsored a b=
ill in 2009 to ban the airing of advertisements for erectile-dysfunction pr=
oducts on commercial television from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.

Interestingly enough, in 2006, Moran pushed for the backing of fellow defen=
se appropriator John Murtha of Pennsylvania in his unsuccessful bid for maj=
ority leader, accusing fellow members of double-crossing Murtha in the secr=
et balloting. He threatened unwanted committee assignments as punishment an=
