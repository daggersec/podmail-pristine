ProgressNow Colorado


Dear Neighbor,

The Koch brothers are firing back at ProgressNow Colorado. It's now
national news that ProgressNow Colorado and our friends and allies are
participating in a protest of the (formerly) secret gathering of
corporate, right-wing donors, and public officials organized by the
Koch brothers near Vail, Colorado tomorrow. In response, we've been
working overtime to spread the word. And we're hopeful that instead of
the peace and quiet they had hoped to plot their next attack on the
middle class while enjoying, the Koch brothers will see something like
this:

Koch Brothers Protest

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DpaESToH9--tYup7U-0cGQQ..

Can't make it to the rally? You can still help.=A0

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3D90fokhr1zcesB92zIXRI7g..

As the Los Angeles Times reports today, "the Kochs have been a target
of liberal activists for their funding of research institutions and
other groups that push a limited-government agenda. They control Koch
Industries, an energy conglomerate that is the nation's second-largest
privately held company.=A0 They are credited with helping to
organize the 'tea party' and allied groups that spent millions to
defeat Democrats in last year's midterm elections." [1]

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DSMGrzeVkQIc1-7zhgePJwA..

In an Associated Press story today reprinted in many newspapers, the
secrecy surrounding this event, and its attendees and funders, is
compared to our organization, ProgressNow Colorado, and our own
supporters. [2]

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3D3mBahfxKZnoM5035vAe4EA..

I can assure you that the Koch brothers spend more than ProgressNow
Colorado's entire budget on just one of these semi-annual
conferences--which then direct untold millions of dollars in corporate
profits for political purposes! This is like Goliath demanding that
David reveal who made his slingshot. It's completely ridiculous.

But now that they mention it...

We do need your help to keep fighting against the Koch brothers'
attempts to dismantle Medicare. We need your help to keep this
conversation focused on what matters. We're not against people making
political donations. We're against using corporate profits to attack
Social Security, Medicare, and vital institutions that the Koch
Brothers want to dismantle for future generations

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DoBci2NY4p6Lr-7aC78qwuQ..

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DmxohxeJOQkViHTehZzk4GQ..

. We're against making painful cuts to education, health care, and
transportation while giving rich people and big corporations more tax
breaks.

And if we're making them this upset, our "teeny-tiny budget" seems
like a really good investment compared to the hundreds of millions of
dollars the Koch brothers are about to flood Colorado politics with!
Please click here to donate $20 today or whatever you can, to help us
cover $3,000 in expenses for tomorrow's protest in Avon. It might seem
a little like chipping in for David vs. Goliath, but that story

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DD3mXNT0_oNRTnaQuKXnFkg..

does have a happy ending.

Optional fun: once you've donated, send an email to your friends or
post on Facebook that you are proud to be donating to ProgressNow--and
encourage them to do the same. We'll see you tomorrow!

Thanks again,

Alan
