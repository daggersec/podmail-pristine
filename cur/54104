Hi john, I wanted to see if you received the below note. As Debbie Stabenow=
 would tell HRC and you, this is an important political moment and opportun=
ity for HRC to support transparency. Gh

good position or response for her for two reasons:

h and as Kirsten Gillibrand pointed out in the Hearing, our own FDA merely =
rubber stamps or affirms the chemical company's findings, rather than condu=
ct their own independent research. But politically as she tries to expand h=
er base, it is not the most solid answer for her because she unfortunately =
can sound like she is catering to the "fuzzy science" left if she is not ca=
reful.

 would have been: "With regard to GMO's, I do feel that more independently =
funded long-term research is needed, but one thing I absolutely believe is =
that, regardless of your views on GMO safety, everyone has the right to kno=

 and transparency. (She could also of course further add to her internation=
al acumen that 64 nations around the world including most of our trading pa=
