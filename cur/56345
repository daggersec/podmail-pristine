i won't make it a habit of sharing News Corp releases, but thought I'd make
this an exception:

*Statement of Rupert Murdoch on the My Brother's Keeper Initiative*

*New York (February 28, 2014) -* Statement of News Corp Executive Chairman
Rupert Murdoch on the My Brother's Keeper initiative:

"There is no issue of greater importance to the future of America than
education.

Right now, millions of children don't have support and are being denied a
high quality education by failing schools, leading to a drop out rate of
more than 20 percent.  All children have to be prepared to succeed in this
modern, technology-based world, or they will be condemned to a life without
real opportunity and prosperity.

Every child in America, no matter gender, skin color or economic status,
deserves a real shot at life, and that begins with a great education. At
the same time, we must support and expand proven programs in our
communities, churches, and in the private sector that support our kids and
keep them on the right path.

I applaud the President for focusing his attention on this important issue
and hope that he will consider even further steps to transform our
antiquated education system.

Beyond our efforts at Amplify, News Corp is committed to advancing this
cause by supporting entrepreneurial efforts in this space, including the
excellent District of Columbia College Access Program (DC-CAP), which
provides scholarships to students pursuing careers in journalism,
education, creative writing or technology."
