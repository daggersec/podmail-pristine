Hi boss,

Hope you're well. Sounds like you've been diligently keeping your frequent f=
lier miles up these last few weeks.

I'm beginning to think about what I want to do next - likely on a timeline t=
o move on either over the summer or after the end of the year (with the fina=
l power plant rule and the Paris COP both seeming like fairly natural exit p=
oints.) I have a few motivations - I'm feeling like I've sort of maxed out w=
hat I can do in my position; it doesn't seem like resolutions to any of the H=
R asks I made when staying are in the offing; etc.

Heather approached me about Equitable Growth's expansion plans and I've had s=
ome interesting conversations with her, Ed, and Elisabeth. They seem to need=
 someone mid-level who can help with policy and with strategic planning for t=
he next stage. It's an interesting prospect, and I wanted to flag it because=
 I think Heather will be reaching out to you for your thoughts.=20

But equally, if you have ideas about where I should be looking or if there a=
re opportunities you've heard of that may suit me, let me know. You know my s=
trengths and weaknesses probably better than anyone, and I'd appreciate your=
 counsel.=20

All best,

Kristina=20
