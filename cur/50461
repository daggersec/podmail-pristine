I apologize for the confusion concerning setting up this fundraising update
meeting, but it now appears that we might be able to move the meeting up a
bit, to tomorrow, Monday, February 11th @ 4:00pm. We will also be changing
the location of the meeting from Tom's offices to Stan Greenberg's offices,
located at 10 G Street, NE, Suite 500. I will send around a confirmation
email about all this tomorrow morning, but of course, if anyone has an issue
with this new change, please let me know.
Thanks again for all your patience with setting this meeting up. Hopefully,
this will be the final change.
Sincerely,
Ryan Duncan
