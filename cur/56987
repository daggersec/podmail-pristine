Week starting February 15

Wins:

   -

   Nevada Megaphone usage: The team sent over 30,000 text messages on
   caucus day in Nevada! We were able to quickly change templates when it
   became clear that lines were very long and we=E2=80=99d want to remind p=
eople to
   stay where they are so that their votes would count.
   -

   Caucus night tech in Nevada: 586 precinct captains submitted caucus
   results through Reporter on caucus day in Nevada. We had attorneys at
   caucus sites using Reporter to submit issues to the boiler room, and the
   call center at Nevada HQ in Las Vegas was using Aurora, our dashboard, t=
o
   submit issues to the boiler room for follow up. Both Reporter and Aurora
   were stable all day and helped support team Nevada on their way to victo=
ry!
   -

   Presenting =E2=80=9CSave my payment=E2=80=9D upsell to HVF donors: We no=
w ask donors who
   come in through HVF Digital Donate pages (mostly Ads-driven traffic) to
   save their card information in order to grow the number of HFA Quick
   Donors. In the 5 days since this change shipped we have seen 1,976 new H=
FA
   Quick Donors which is a rapid increase in-line with the increase in
   Ads-based traffic seen in the past few weeks.
   -

   =E2=80=9CDonate in Failover=E2=80=9D mini-project complete: We hit our g=
oal of
   completing all of the work items to ensure the Donate experience is
   optimized to not leave money on the table when we are in failover mode (=
e.g
   when Stripe is unhealthy and we are running in backup payment
   processor-mode). This means that user actions that are not supported in
   failover mode are now smartly hidden and we queue Quick Donate donations=
 so
   they can be processed when the system is healthy.
   -

   Shop Infinite Scroll: Team Donate shipped one of the most highly
   anticipated feature improvements for The Shop in Q1 which was to add
   infinite scroll to homepage and other collections as well as search
   results. See it live here
   <https://shop.hillaryclinton.com/collections/apparel>!
   -

   Ads Core A/B Test:We are A/B testing a new layout of the Ads Core
   landing page, 50% of visitors will see this new experience
   <https://www.hillaryclinton.com/forms/om-hvf-join-split/>. This new
   design is inspired by the direction of the website re-design. Results wi=
ll
   likely be reported this week.


Updates:

   -

   HFA cloud Vertica migration: Due to a higher workload on the analytics
   team and the fact that the DNC cluster has been reasonably stable recent=
ly
   we have postponed the migration to HFA Vertica until the March states ar=
e
   done. The HFA cluster is ready incase there are issues on the DNC side.
   -

   Call tool update: The voter engineering team is grinding away at getting
   the call tool up and running. The team is going to be doing some
   stress-testing of the system and is working to make the tool available f=
or
   a live beta as soon as possible.


Hiring:


   - Welcome Riley! Riley is joining the data infrastructure team and is
   turning Stork into a first class supported tool. He is adding
   functionality, security updates and speed improvements that will help th=
e
   analytics team. He comes to us with many years of experience and most
   recently was consulting for Bloomberg.
