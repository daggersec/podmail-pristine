ork.  The 14 Democratic Senators met with the White House today and reports=
 back were not positive for the WH.  A cloture vote could happen in the Sen=
ate as early as tonight with a final TPA vote potentially happening on Tues=
day next week.  In the House CBC Chairman Butterfield along with four other=
 CBC members signed a letter to the Senate saying that if they attach TAA t=
o African Growth Opportunity Act they can't count on their votes for it in =
the House.
