Specter backs public option on health care
<http://blogs.mcall.com/penn_ave/2009/06/specter-backs-public-option-on-
health-care.html>=20


Posted by Josh Drobnyk at 05:31:56 PM on June 25, 2009=20

Sen. Arlen Specter told a boisterous crowd of union activists today that
he backs a public health insurance option as part of the health care
overhaul Congress is debating.

"I know you are very interested in the public component and I think
Senator Schumer has the right idea about having a public component,"
Specter said at a rally held at the Capitol City Brewery near Union
Station.

The shift -- Specter opposed a public option only months ago -- comes as
Specter faces a potential primary opponent next spring in U.S. Rep. Joe
Sestak and as a new poll shows his favorability rating at a 17-year low.

Here are all of his remarks, as provided by his staff...=20

I compliment you on your tenacity and your determination and your
passion.  I agree with you that health care is a right.=20
               =20
I am sorry to be a little late but President Obama scheduled a meeting
at the White House on immigration and it ran a little long.  But I'm
glad to see you here, and I'm glad to have the opportunity to speak to
you.=20
               =20
We are working hard on health care reform legislation.  President Obama
has established a summit and invited me to attend.  And I do believe
that there will be health care legislation.  I know you are very
interested in the public component and I think Senator Schumer has the
right idea about having a public component which is to have a level
playing field with the private sector, but the public component can be
in place.    =20
          =20
I started life as a Democrat.  My family was a typical American family,
immigrant parents, tough times during the depression.  FDR Democrats, so
I was a JFK Democrat.  I tried in the Senate for years to have a
moderate wing and when President Obama was elected and wanted to bring
in the stimulus package, and came and talked to us Senators and laid it
on the line about the United States facing possibly a 1929 type
depression.  I voted for the stimulus package - provided it a key vote
to get it passed.  For Pennsylvania it means 143,000 jobs, it means $16
billion, it means the continuation of Medicaid and Medicare, and SCHIP -
health care for children.   It is the right thing to do, and I have had
a voting record over the years more in line with Democrats than
Republicans.  I voted for a woman's right to choose.  I took the lead
with Senator Harkin on increasing funding for the National Institutes of
Health from $12 to 30 billion.  I voted 22 times for Davis-Bacon, 20
times for extending unemployment compensation, cosponsored legislation
for the minimum wage.  There were a lot of Democrats who had been urging
me to change my registration.   I rode the train for three decades with
then-Senator Biden from Washington to Wilmington - I went on to
Philadelphia.  Do you know how repetitious Joe Biden can be?  And Ed
Rendell has urged me for years to become a Democrat.  You may not know
that I gave Ed Rendell his first job out of law school.  He was a law
student at Villanova, I was District Attorney.   He wanted to become an
Assistant D.A. so he could become famous and get to be governor and
there you are.  He wanted me to become a Democrat and after I voted for
the stimulus package I found more Republicans who wanted me to be a
Democrat than Democrats who wanted me to become a Democrat.  So I went
with the flow and we feel very comfortable, I don't have to look over my
right shoulder anymore. =20
               =20
I came in with Eileen Connolly who's holding my coat.  And the Employee
Free Choice Act was mentioned, and we're working hard to find the answer
which will get early union certification and we'll get the first
contract.  But today I know your focus is on health care.  I have to go
down to the Senate chamber, we're about to vote on Dean Koh, where the
filibuster was defeated.  He's a very strong Obama nominee to be legal
counsel to the Department of State.=20
               =20
But I thank you for coming to Washington, I think you for putting up
with this heat and waiting and I thank you for your passion and your
presence and your rally.  Your enthusiasm has a big effect on what goes
on three blocks away on the Congress of the United States.  And you will
get health care. =20

I started life as a Democrat.&nbsp; My family was a typical American family=
,
immigrant parents, tough times during the depression.&nbsp; FDR Democrats, =
so I
was a JFK Democrat.&nbsp; I tried in the Senate for years to have a moderat=
e
wing and when President Obama was elected and wanted to bring in the stimul=
us
package, and came and talked to us Senators and laid it on the line about t=
he <st1:place
w:st=3D"on"><st1:country-region w:st=3D"on">United States</st1:country-regi=
on></st1:place>
facing possibly a 1929 type depression.&nbsp; I voted for the stimulus pack=
age
- provided it a key vote to get it passed.&nbsp; For <st1:place w:st=3D"on"=
><st1:State
 w:st=3D"on">Pennsylvania</st1:State></st1:place> it means 143,000 jobs, it=
 means
$16 billion, it means the continuation of Medicaid and Medicare, and SCHIP
&#8211; health care for children.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the right thing to do, =
and
I have had a voting record over the years more in line with Democrats than
Republicans.&nbsp; I voted for a woman&#8217;s right to choose.&nbsp; I too=
k
the lead with Senator Harkin on increasing funding for the National Institu=
tes
of Health from $12 to 30 billion.&nbsp; I voted 22 times for Davis-Bacon, 2=
0
times for extending unemployment compensation, cosponsored legislation for =
the
minimum wage.&nbsp; There were a lot of Democrats who had been urging me to
change my registration.&nbsp;&nbsp; I rode the train for three decades with
then-Senator Biden from <st1:State w:st=3D"on">Washington</st1:State> to <s=
t1:City
w:st=3D"on">Wilmington</st1:City> - I went on to <st1:place w:st=3D"on"><st=
1:City
 w:st=3D"on">Philadelphia</st1:City></st1:place>.&nbsp; Do you know how
repetitious Joe Biden can be?&nbsp; And Ed Rendell has urged me for years t=
o
become a Democrat.&nbsp; You may not know that I gave Ed Rendell his first =
job
out of law school.&nbsp; He was a law student at Villanova, I was District
Attorney.&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted to become an Assistant D.A. so he could bec=
ome
famous and get to be governor and there you are.&nbsp; He wanted me to beco=
me a
Democrat and after I voted for the stimulus package I found more Republican=
s
who wanted me to be a Democrat than Democrats who wanted me to become a
Democrat.&nbsp; So I went with the flow and we feel very comfortable, I
don&#8217;t have to look over my right shoulder anymore.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I came in with Eileen Connolly who&#8217;s holding my coat.&nbsp; And the
Employee Free Choice Act was mentioned, and we&#8217;re working hard to fin=
d
the answer which will get early union certification and we&#8217;ll get the
first contract.&nbsp; But today I know your focus is on health care.&nbsp; =
I
have to go down to the Senate chamber, we&#8217;re about to vote on Dean Ko=
h,
where the filibuster was defeated.&nbsp; He&#8217;s a very strong Obama nom=
inee
to be legal counsel to the Department of State. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=
sp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
But I thank you for coming to Washington, I think you for putting up with t=
his
heat and waiting and I thank you for your passion and your presence and you=
r
rally.&nbsp; Your enthusiasm has a big effect on what goes on three blocks =
away
on the Congress of the <st1:place w:st=3D"on"><st1:country-region w:st=3D"o=
n">United
  States</st1:country-region></st1:place>.&nbsp; And you will get health
care.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
