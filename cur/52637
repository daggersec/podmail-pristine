Good morning,

We have been able to confirm the date for 6/5 but getting the invite
approved seems to be delayed and I am concerned that it will not allow
enough time to effectively promote the event, is there someway to expedite
this?

Thank you and hope the Capitol Hill Classic was a fun race!

Best, Marguerite
