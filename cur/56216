John --=20

Prepare yourself for job layoffs, reduced access to early
education, slower emergency response, slashed health care,
and more people living on the street.

This Friday is the final deadline for congressional
Republicans to stop disastrous automatic spending cuts
(known as the "sequester") that will hurt everyday
Americans -- including you.

These budget cuts will take a sledgehammer to the budget,
and indiscriminately cut critical programs vital to
economic growth and middle class families.

If Congress fails to act, we'd see budget cuts pretty much
across the board to critical services that teachers, first
responders, seniors, children, and our men and women in
uniform rely on every day.

It sounds bad because it is. And with all these cuts on the
line, why are congressional Republicans refusing to budge?

Because to do so, they'd have to close tax loopholes for
millionaires and billionaires, oil companies, vacation
homes, and private jet owners. I'm not kidding.

It's on each of us to speak up. Share what these budget
cuts could mean to you -- or someone you know -- today.
Congress needs to hear it:

http://my.barackobama.com/Share-Your-Sequester-Story

President Obama has offered a balanced plan to reduce our
deficit, asking the wealthy to pay their fair share so that
we can protect programs that are incredibly important for
working and middle-class Americans.

But congressional Republicans so far are refusing to
compromise.

Here are some of the consequences if Congress fails to
act by Friday:

-- 10,000 teachers would be laid off, $400 million would be
cut from Head Start, the program that makes sure at-risk
preschoolers are ready for kindergarten, and 70,000 kids
would be kicked out of the early-education program
completely.=20

-- The budget for firemen and other first responders to
react when natural disasters strike would be cut by $35
million.

-- Nutrition programs that help make sure seniors don't go
hungry would be cut by $43 million.

-- A program that helps provide housing for the formerly
homeless, including many veterans, would be shuttered,
putting them at risk of going back on the street.

-- A number of programs that help the most vulnerable
families and children would be slashed -- including the
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
and Children dropping 600,000 women alone.

Right now, each of us has a responsibility to step up and
make sure Congress hears our voices.=20

Whether you'd be directly affected by these sequester cuts,
or whether they'd affect a senior, veteran, or teacher you
know, please share what they mean to you:

http://my.barackobama.com/Share-Your-Sequester-Story

Let's keep the pressure on congressional Republicans to do
the right thing.

Thanks,

Stephanie
