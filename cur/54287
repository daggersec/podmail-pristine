10/15/08)*
By CHRISTOPHER WILLS
TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Falling behind in the polls, Republican candidate John
McCain hopes to shake up the presidential race in his final debate with
Democrat Barack Obama, who will be looking to close the deal with voters
unhappy with the country's direction.
Both are likely to emphasize pocketbook issues, a burning concern as
financial institutions wobble and voters feel the pinch of a faltering
economy. Each released proposals this week for how to boost the economy.

By Mike Madden
A day before the final presidential debate of the year -- and three weeks

figure out how to regain momentum in a race that, for him, has gone south

"I was astonished to hear him say that he was surprised I 'didn't have the

fashion," McCain said of the last debate. "I think he's probably ensured it
will come up this time."

*In Parallel Wording, Divergent Messages (WaPo 10/15/08)*
By Robert Barnes
As Obama and McCain honed their economic messages in advance of tonight's

Democratic front-runner invoking the image of a legendary Democratic
president or the former prisoner of war drawing on his darkest days.

The rhetoric that Obama and McCain use to describe how they would address
the nation's crippling economic woes goes to the heart of the appeal each i=
s
making to voters.

*Running mates have clearer gun-control positions than McCain and Obama (AP
10/15/08)*
By GLEN JOHNSON
BOSTON (AP) -- John McCain supports background checks for buyers at gun
shows and has his name on a law restricting special-interest group
advertising, two positions strongly opposed by the National Rifle
Association.
So how'd he end up with the group's presidential endorsement? By running
against Barack Obama, whom NRA leaders accuse of wanting to put the firearm=
s
industry out of business.
"Hillary was right: You can't trust Obama with your guns," the association'=
s
Political Victory Fund said in a recent mailing.
The endorsement reflects the complicated role that gun control is playing i=
n
the 2008 campaign.

NEW YORK (CNN) =96 John McCain just can't seem to get away from George W.
Bush.
On emerging from his New York hotel on Tuesday evening to attend a high

view so ironic it would force even Jonathan Swift crack a smile.
There, next to his motorcade, was the Ziegfeld Theatre, the venue for the

McCain will pay for the increases in science funding by cutting other

and Senator Obama ought to personally repudiate Congress's Lewis's
statement. It is not only connected to George Wallace but also the deaths o=
f
innocent young children in church bombings."
McCain added, "I am proud of our campaign. I am proud of the campaign I hav=
e
done, so Jimmy, you're off base when you compare the two statements. One
from a most respected member of Congress and civil rights leader and one
from somebody no one knows about which we have repudiated continuously."

By Michael Gerson
A losing Republican is not merely unfortunate; he must be incompetent,

John McCain has reached this stage of criticism among conservatives. Some
attack him for "frenetic improvisation," while others urge him to
frenetically improvise. His campaign is in a "defensive crouch" while also
being "obnoxious" in its "phony populism." McCain's running mate is a "fata=
l
cancer" who should "read more books."

*'Muslim' shouldn't be a slur: Both McCain and Obama should condemn implici=

Excuse me, but when did the words "Muslim" and "Arab" become acceptable
epithets?
I'm not a Muslim, and perhaps I was slow to see this coming. Four months
ago, I blithely advised a group at a local mosque not to obsess over the
anti-Muslim undertones of the presidential campaign. At that point, Barack
Obama was defending his Christian bona fides against "accusations" of "bein=
g
a Muslim" (as if it had suddenly become a Class-D felony), but was doing so
without condemning the implicit slurs against Islam, Muslims and Arabs.

By PETER J. WALLISON
While there has been significant deregulation in the U.S. economy during th=

only significant legislation with any effect on financial risk-taking was
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, adopted
during the first Bush administration in the wake of the collapse of the
savings and loans (S&Ls). FDICIA, however, substantially tightened
commercial bank and S&L regulations, including prompt corrective action whe=
n
a bank's capital declines below adequate levels and severe personal fines i=

By Alexander Mooney<br>(CNN) =97 Amid a string of polls that suggest Democr=
ats could be in striking distance of reaching a filibuster-proof majority, =
the Republican National Committee is considering taking out a loan to help =
endangered senators in key battleground states, a GOP strategist told CNN T=
uesday.<br>
The news comes a week after the RNC announced it had raised $66 million in =
September, its best fundraising month ever. But in an effort to keep pace w=
ith Barack Obama&#39;s cash advantage over John McCain, those funds are goi=
ng entirely toward the presidential race.<br>

<br><b>Behind the GOP&#39;s voter fraud hysteria (Salon 10/15/08)</b><br>By=
 Andrew Burmon<br>The Democrats in this age have no reason to pretend that =
voter fraud is a serious issue, but the Republicans, particularly this year=
, have a very good reason to say that voter fraud is rampant. It is a simpl=
e three-step process. Fraud allegations lead to restrictive voter laws, whi=
ch lead to a class-skewed electorate. As the Democrats try to get out the v=

By Pam Fessler<br>Republicans continue to mount the pressure, with their pr=

 by law to turn in every form they collect, even if it&#39;s signed by Dona=
