Subject: The event I wrote to you about earlier
To: "John D. Podesta" <john.podesta@gmail.com>
Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=001a113a4cb2b7b45d051a8951dd

I wrote a post on Medium to announce it, called The WTF Economy. It's been
getting a lot of attention.

https://medium.com/@timoreilly/the-wtf-economy-a3bd5f52ef00

I'll be doing a lot more writing there over the next few months.

The website for the event itself is here:

http://conferences.oreilly.com/next-economy

You may notice the difference between the two names.  I'm setting up for an
eventual piece called "From the WTF Economy to the Next Economy."

At any rate, wanted to keep this on your radar in the event that Hillary
can come!  As we discussed, I know it's a long shot.

P.S. Laura Tyson isn't on the speaker list yet, but she has agreed to join
the program, and is helping to bring together the right economists.
