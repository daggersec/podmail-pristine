Friends and Colleagues,=20

As I shared last fall, Friday March 12 will be my last day at Education
Sector.   ES has been a great experience for me and I'm happy to be able
to leave the organization as a sustainable one ready to continue to grow
and undertake important work.

=20

Here's what's next for me and how to find me:

=20

First, I'm excited to be a founding partner at Bellwether Education
Partners, a new, not-for-profit education organization that will work
with a variety of entities committed to dramatically improving
educational outcomes for low-income students.  Our goal is to strengthen
the field of these organizations via a multipronged approach.   I'll be
leading thought leadership, idea generation, and policy work at
Bellwether but the organization will also be doing work on leadership,
strategy, and executive search.   We're also going to help some great
new education projects get off the ground.  The team we're building at
Bellwether is tremendous and I'm really looking forward the impact
Bellwether will have in building the field.  I'll also continue to write
the Eduwonk blog and the other writing I do.  You'll be hearing more
about BW in the months ahead as we formally launch.

=20

After Friday you can find me at andy@bellwethereducation.org  My cell
phone will not change nor will my personal email.  My new office line
will be (703) 920-2031.

=20

In addition, via Whiteboard Advisors, the non-lobbying arm of Dutko
Worldwide, John Bailey and I are launching Education Insider, a new
political and policy market intelligence service that will provide
unprecedented access to information and analytics about federal
education policy trends and likely outcomes.   Through a survey model
and expert analysis we will provide subscribers - who subscribe on a
monthly or annual basis - outstanding visibility into issues, trends,
and likely outcomes in federal policymaking.   Subscribers include
public, private, philanthropic, and non-profit entities.  =20

=20

And I'll be involved with the Center on Reinventing Public Education at
the University of Washington and the PostPartisan Foundation as well as
some other projects.  =20

=20

Again, I can be found a few ways:
