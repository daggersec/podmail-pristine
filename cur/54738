Dear Friend,

This year we are running against a right-wing ideologue, Congressman Toomey=
, who as the past President of Club for Growth for six years, lead the spec=
ial interest group's efforts to purge the Republican Party of moderates.

For example, in 2006 Congressman Toomey launched attacks ads against modera=
te GOP Senator Lincoln Chafe (R-Rhode Island) leading to Chafe's defeat. La=
st year, U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) was skewered by him as "Comra=
de of the Month" for having voted for President Obama's stimulus legislatio=
n.

Joe's candidacy is broad-based with support not only among Democrats and In=
dependents, but also with Republicans.

This past Wednesday, former U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel, a leading Republican =
and Vietnam Veteran, came to Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh and Philadelphia) to =
endorse Joe, stating:


=E2=80=A2    "I believe that Joe Sestak is the exactly the kind of leader t=
hat America needs, especially at this time in our history."

"I first met Joe four years ago when he came to the Congress. I was very im=
pressed within the first two months of his appearance. That impression deep=
ened on a Sunday morning early in his first year in the House, when he was =
on Meet The Press. I was truly captivated by his knowledge, his ability to =
articulate what he thought and the fact that I thought he had it right."

" I was impressed by a man who had served 31 years in the U.S. Navy raising=
 to a Vice-Admiral, a 3-star Admiral, this was a man who knew something abo=
ut national security. He understood the world, and what he had been doing o=
ver that career was quite impressive."

"We got acquainted on a trip to Iraq and Kuwait over five days =E2=80=A6 I =
watched him, I listened to him, I spent a lot of time with him over 5 days =
and nights ... found out that I had never met a public servant so committed=
 to making a better world than Joe Sestak."

" Over the next three years we became better acquainted ... we talked often=
, watched how people responded to him, I watched him respond to others, I w=
atched his style of leadership."

" We are now in a world that is going to require a new dimension of leaders=
hip =E2=80=A6 we want people who are honest, people who are competent in ex=
perience, independent thinking, courageous leadership, not afraid to take o=
n past assumptions and status quo, not afraid to take on your own party whe=
n that is required ... Joe Sestak is such a leader."

"Driven to find solutions ... find consensus ... cross-the-aisle to find co=
nsensus =E2=80=A6 find solutions ... fix the problem =E2=80=A6 bring people=
 together =E2=80=A6 I've seen Joe Sestak do that ... that is why he is in t=
his business to make a better world."

"If we continue to work hard and get Joe to the U.S. Senate, he can further=
 demonstrate all the assets that he has built a reputation on, a lifetime o=
f achievements."

A U.S. Senator is one who demonstrates leadership, who represents all the p=
eople, who crosses party-lines, who builds consensus, who brings people tog=
ether to fix the problems =E2=80=A6 to make a better world.

Joe Sestak is such a person, as Senator Hagel has attested to! We are askin=
g you to please make a contribution today of $15, $25, $50, $75, $100, $250=
, or even more, to reach our August goal to ensure Joe gets to the U.S. Sen=
ate!

Pennsylvania, and the nation, simply cannot afford to have an ideologue ...=
 a demagogue ... like Congressman Toomey in the U.S. Senate. One day after =
Senator Hagel's announcement, Cross-roads GPS - a conservative group founde=
d by former Bush White House Senior Advisor Karl Rove - announced that it w=
as launching a $500,000 television ad campaign attacking Joe's record. You =
can help us respond by making a contribution of just a few dollars =E2=80=
=A6 it all adds up =E2=80=A6 when you are being attacked by right-wing dema=
gogues.

We're about to launch our September 1 operation called "Doing The Right Thi=
ng" ... by contributing, you'll ensure this critical operation succeeds.

Help us elect Joe =E2=80=A6 whom Senator Hagel said he "had never met a pub=
lic servant so committed to making a better world than Joe Sestak."

Thank you!

Best regards,
Rich Sestak
Campaign Director

P.S.   On Monday, we'll tell you the driving force behind "Doing The Right =
Thing".

                                                        Pennsylvania, and the nation, simply cannot afford to have an ideologue ... a demagogue ... like Congressman Toomey in the U.S. Senate. One day after Senator Hagel's announcement, Cross-roads GPS - a conservative group founded by former Bush White House Senior Advisor Karl Rove - announced that it was launching a $500,000 television ad campaign attacking Joe's record. <a href="http://salsa.wiredforchange.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=L2QdGlmAS6E%2FluBtO%2BltQA9yozxAD%2BNl"><u><b>You can help us respond by making a contribution of just a few dollars &hellip; it all adds up &hellip; when you are being attacked by right-wing demagogues.</b></u></a><br />
