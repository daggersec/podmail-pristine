Anti-Bush Tour Bus Makes Its Debut <http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/06/=

Americans United for Change has long opposed many of President Bush's polici=
es, but this year it's found a new way to say it-with a 28-ton bus.

The group today launched its Bush Legacy Bus, a rolling museum dedicated to =
the "worst policy failures" of the Bush administration. The bus will travel =
the country for the next five months, stopping in 150 cities and bearing a s=
imple message: that Bush's policies have wreaked havoc on America.

The bus features interactive exhibits on the Iraq war, the economy, and heal=
thcare. A screen displays images of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, wit=
h captions that criticize the government's response. A chart entitled "not j=
ust Bush's war" traces Iraq war support to House Minority Leader John Boehne=
r (R-Ohio), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and former House=
 Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas). The floor shows a timeline of events i=
n the Bush presidency.

 <http://www.bushlegacytour.com/page/-/bushlegacytour/images/BushLegacyBus-E=
xt.jpg>=20

The bus is not just one group's effort. Its funding comes from a network of =
liberal interest groups that often work with Americans United for Change und=
er the "progressive" umbrella: sponsors and partners include MoveOn.org, Cen=
ter for American Progress, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), AFL=
-CIO, VoteVets.org, and American Federation of State, County and Municipal E=
mployees (AFSCME).

The bus will make its first stop in Dayton, Ohio tomorrow to campaign agains=
t Boehner. It will visit Louisville, Ky. Thursday to campaign against McConn=
ell.

"Eight years later, conservative government rule, of which President Bush se=
rved as the vessel, has left an economy in recession, the costs for healthca=
re, college tuition, food and gas skyrocketing and out of reach for most Ame=
ricans," Americans United for Change President Brad Woodhouse said in a stat=
ement that accompanied the bus's launch.

"But to be clear, this effort is not about Bush-it is about the conservative=
 ideology he and his allies in Congress, including John McCain, represent," =
Woodhouse said.

The bus is part of the group's Bush Legacy Project, which has sought to to c=
riticize of Bush since January, when the group aired a television ad <http:/=
/www.americansunitedforchange.org/blog/entries/state_of_the_union/>  near th=
e president's State of the Union address. The idea for the bus came in Febru=
ary, and Americans United for Change has been planning its construction for =
the past several months, a spokesman said.

The group unveiled the bus today at a cookout in front of the AFL-CIO's nati=
onal headquarters, across Lafayette Park from the White House. The bus then =
left for the Capitol, where it sat on display this afternoon.
