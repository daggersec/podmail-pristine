Here's a spox statement to hold on TPA and set a high bar on TPP.
Including a short version and also a longer version that puts down more
substantive markers.



*SHORT VERSION*



Hillary looks forward to studying the details of this new proposal and
seeing what emerges from the legislative process.  But procedural questions
are ultimately less important than what=E2=80=99s in the final Trans-Pacifi=
c
Partnership (TPP) agreement now being negotiated.  Hillary believes that
any new trade deal has to pass two tests: First, does it protect American
workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home than it displaces?
Second, does it also strengthen our national security?  If TPP falls short
of these tests, we should be willing to walk away.  The goal is greater
prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade=E2=80=99=
s sake.
So she will be watching these negotiations closely to see if the final
agreement meets this high bar.



*LONGER VERSION*

prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade=E2=80=99=
s sake.



Hillary will be watching these negotiations closely as there are a number
of pivotal questions to be decided in the coming months: from improving
labor rights and protecting the environment, public health, and access to
life-saving medicines; to cracking down on currency manipulation and unfair
competition by state-owned enterprises; to opening new opportunities for
our family farms and small businesses to export their products and services
overseas.  Getting these things right will go a long way toward ensuring
that a final agreement will be a net plus for everyday Americans.



Also, as Hillary warned in her book, Hard Choices, we shouldn=E2=80=99t all=
ow
multinational corporations to use the so-called =E2=80=9Cinvestor-state dis=
pute
settlement,=E2=80=9D or ISDS, to undermine legitimate health, social, econo=
mic, and
environmental regulations, as Philip Morris has tried to do in Australia.
Our trade agreements shouldn=E2=80=99t be about giving special rights to
corporations at the expense of workers and consumers.



When it comes to trade, we haven=E2=80=99t always gotten the balance right.=
  But
we=E2=80=99ve learned a lot in recent years about what works for the Americ=
an
middle class and what doesn=E2=80=99t.  Now is the time to apply those hard=
-earned
lessons.  Hillary believes we should set a high bar for TPP and other
future agreements, and only support them if they create jobs, raise wages,
and advance our national security.

We have a good bit.  I think we need a holding statement.   Dan - can you
draft something off of existing q and a that says we are looking at the TPA
bill and outlines bar TPP will have to meet?
