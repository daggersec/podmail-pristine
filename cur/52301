Hi John,

Amy wants to schedule a conference call with the FFA board of directors for
today or tomorrow morning. She indicated that this is a call you wanted to
schedule urgently.

Looking at your schedule for today, the only time available is 12:30pm.
Otherwise Amy is suggesting tomorrow (Saturday), February 2 in the morning.

Do you want to have this call today or tomorrow or would you rather wait
until next week?

Thanks,
Caitlin
