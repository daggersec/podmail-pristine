Dear Dr. Piracha and Dr. Rehman,<br>
<br>
First of all, I hope you have an extraordinarily successful convention this=
 weekend. John Podesta is back from his West coast tour and would like to d=
o a call tomorrow at a time that is good for the both of you. Can you both =
please give me two times which would work for you. We realize how important=
 this call will be, especially in light of the fact that you&#39;ll be meet=
ing with so many members of your organization this weekend. John is 100% co=
mmitted to having you as part of the Clinton team. In the meantime we hope =
to give the both of you enough information to share with your group this we=
ekend. John inquired today as to whether you would like any of the healthca=
re policy people in the line for the all as well- so let us know if that&#3=
9;s something you&#39;d like. Also, we have recently been assigned a fundra=
ising membership number which is specifically for your group to use for coo=
rdinated fundraising efforts going forward.<br>
<br>
Ashley will send out the call in information once we have a time settled. L=
ook forward to speaking to the both of you tomorrow.<br>
