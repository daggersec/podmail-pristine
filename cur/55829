John --

I just finished sending a note to a bunch of our 2012 campaign donors, =
asking them to match a fellow grassroots supporter's first gift to the =
campaign.

Our records show that you know how our matching programs work, because =
you've given through one of them before. Our records also show that you =
haven't made a donation yet to the 2012 campaign.

Getting as many people giving as early as possible is crucial to our =
budgeting process -- right now we're making tough decisions about where we =
can open offices and when we can hire the staff to support our volunteers.

If you jump into the 2012 campaign now by making a matching donation of =
$25 or more, you'll double your impact and help bring someone new into the =
campaign with you.

How about it?

https://donate.barackobama.com/2011-Pledge5

From the start of President Obama's 2008 campaign, this operation has =
viewed fundraising as part of a larger organizing mission. If you can =
inspire someone to make their first donation, you'll help them take a =
crucial step in their relationship with the campaign.

The person you motivate to take that step and own a piece of this =
organization becomes more likely to volunteer their time, engage their =
friends, become leaders in their community -- and eventually inspire a few =
new donors of their own.

You've helped bring in new supporters before -- you know how critical it =
is to our mission to get as many people as possible to give.

It's time to get started:

Thanks,
