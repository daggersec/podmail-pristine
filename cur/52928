Fyi from Dick Sauber, prominent DC attorney who played a GovEthics role
for John Kerry and wants to help us.  Let me know if you'd like me to
connect you or anyone else involved.

Julius- Jon Molot forwarded to me your e-mail. I was asked for President
Kerry (remember him?) to take over the GovEthics disclosure and trust
issues for cabinet and sub-cabinet nominees. The GEO puts together books
and is very helpful. I met with them several times to prepare and make
sure I had it right. The big issues are proper disclosure and acceptable
blind trusts. I would very much like to take this responsaibility again
if the campaign wants me to-- I have previously spoken to my friend
Richard Danzig about this so you might want to coordinate with him. I am
on Martha's Vineyard so the best communication is by email. Dick Sauber
