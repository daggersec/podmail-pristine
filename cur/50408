Friends -

In addition to being endorsed by the Des Moines Register and the Sioux City
Journal yesterday evening, the Concord Monitor endorsed Hillary Clinton
this morning, leading with this key line: "Only one Democratic candidate
for president is truly qualified to hold the job: Hillary Clinton."

Only one Democratic candidate for president is truly qualified to hold the
job: Hillary Clinton.

No contender=E2=80=99s resume can come within miles of matching Clinton=E2=
=80=99s. She=E2=80=99s
ready to take up the nation=E2=80=99s top job on day one and her knowledge =
of
domestic issues and foreign policy is encyclopedic. There is also a strong
chance, should Clinton become president, that the poisonous partisanship
that=E2=80=99s paralyzed Washington will be diminished rather than increase=
d. Why?
During her eight years as a senator from New York, she proved her ability
to find common ground with Republicans, accords that allowed needed
legislation to advance.


Clinton=E2=80=99s performance during her four years as President Obama=E2=
=80=99s secretary
of state during tumultuous times and terrorist attacks led former secretary
of state Henry Kissinger to say that she =E2=80=9Cran the State Department =
in the
most effective way I=E2=80=99ve ever seen.=E2=80=9D He was not the only sen=
ior Republican
with foreign policy experience to feel that way. In contrast, Clinton=E2=80=
=99s
chief rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, despite his quarter-century in Congress,
is a foreign policy naif, albeit one who made the right call in opposing
the war in Iraq.


Clinton has visited the Monitor many times over the years and we=E2=80=99ve=
 come to
know her pretty well. Sure, she=E2=80=99s tough as nails when she needs to =
be, but
we=E2=80=99ve found her to be warm, funny and without the arrogance display=
ed by so
many high-level politicians.


She is a centrist, but one who has campaigned for social justice since
early adulthood. Clinton began her political life as a Republican like her
parents, but a speech Martin Luther King gave in her hometown of Chicago
changed her life and drew her to public service. She became a Democrat, and
as a law student at Yale worked to prevent child abuse and promote child
welfare. Her first Washington job was as a researcher on then Minnesota
Sen. Walter Mondale=E2=80=99s committee investigating the living conditions=
 of
migrant workers.

Clinton=E2=80=99s concern for the downtrodden has been unwavering.


In the 1970s, she became the first woman to chair the board of the Legal
Services Corporation, which was created to increase access to legal
services for the poor. As first lady, and the lead proponent of a failed
attempt to provide access to health care for all that=E2=80=99s not unlike =
the
Affordable Care Act, she learned how Washington, and the special interests
that fight to get their hands on the levers of government, work. In the
process, she played a key role in the creation of what became the
Children=E2=80=99s Health Insurance Program operated by the states.


The plans Clinton has put forward =E2=80=93 whether on foreign policy, maki=
ng
college more affordable, addressing climate change or increasing access to
health care =E2=80=93 display her knowledge of the issues. They are not pie=
-in-the
sky, but achievable. Her health plan, for example, builds on the success of
Obamacare. By contrast, Sanders=E2=80=99s health plan, such as it is, was d=
escribed
by Vox founder and health care analyst Ezra Klein as offering voters
=E2=80=9Cpuppies and rainbows.=E2=80=9D Virtually none of what he has pledg=
ed to do is
achievable.


Clinton was the first first lady in history to run for elected office and
the first female senator from New York. If elected, she would become the
first female president. She knows how to get things done in a country with
many needs and many threats, the greatest of which is the political
dysfunction that has prevented their being addressed. She gets our
strongest possible endorsement for the Democratic nomination.
