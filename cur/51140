The answer to the President's question is "Hell no, it
isn't the end!"

Our opponents want to close the book on the Obama White
House and everything it represents -- all that we've built
together and all the progress we'll continue to make
together.

We can't let that happen. Donate $5 or more now:

Thanks,

Subject: The end?

Friend --

It's August 23rd. And 75 days from now, I'll either be
looking at another four years in the White House -- or the
end of this opportunity.

I know what's at stake for the parents worrying about
health care, the kids who need help to go to college, and
the seniors who want a secure retirement.

But we're getting outspent by wide margins in critical
battleground states -- and what we do about that today
could be the difference between winning and losing on
November 6th.=20

So as we near one of the last fundraising deadlines of this
campaign, I'm asking you to pitch in $5 right now:

https://donate.barackobama.com/73-Days6

Thanks for all you do,

Barack
