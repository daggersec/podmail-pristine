DEATH PENALTY

YOU have said recently that YOU support the death penalty. Can YOU clarify =
YOUR position?


=95        For the federal government, no, I don=92t think we should abolis=
h the death penalty entirely. But I do think it should be reserved as an op=
tion for the most serious crimes, or for acts of terrorism, like the Boston=
 Marathon bomber. Remember, I was the Senator from New York on September 11=
. And I was First Lady when the Oklahoma City bomber killed 168 people, inc=
luding 19 children.  I met their parents. I saw what was done.  Because of =
acts of terror like these, I think about the federal death penalty differen=
tly.



=95        But we know the death penalty has too often been applied in a di=
scriminatory way at the state level. African-Americans are far more likely =
than whites to face the death penalty than whites. States have almost certa=
inly executed inmates who were innocent of the crimes for which they=92d be=
en put on death row. And it=92s profoundly wrong for states to =91experimen=
t=92 with different cocktails of lethal injection drugs because of shortage=
s. Our Constitution is supposed to protect against cruel and unusual punish=
ment. And the Supreme Court recently even stayed an execution because of th=
is issue.



=95        So I think states need to look carefully at whether they should =
continue the policy. At how it=92s been applied, and whether there are disc=
riminatory effects=97particularly for African-Americans. And to do more to =
allow inmates to pursue claims of actual innocence. There is nothing more u=
njust and unacceptable than imposing the death penalty on someone who is in=
nocent of the crime. And I want to incentivize every state to put in place =
procedures for inmates to petition for post-conviction DNA testing.

DEATH PENALTY

19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 st=
ates, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the Nation=
al Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been=
 on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been execut=
ed in the U.S. That=92s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but lat=
er exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the curre=
nt list and abolish the death penalty?
