Dear Friend,

Special interests have combined to spend $95 million against five =
Democrats they're targeting. Today, we're fighting back with a grassroots =
moneybomb to prevent special interests from buying the Senate.

These five Democrats -- Kay Hagan, Mark Begich, Mark Pryor, Mary Landrieu, =
and Colorado's own Mark Udall -- are under attack because they put their =
constituents' needs ahead of the special interests' agenda.=20

With 20 days until the election, these five Democrats need our help to =
fend off tens of millions in special interest spending. Help them out by =
joining our moneybomb right now.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/20141015_top4_bennet

We've worked with these leaders on issues that matter to Colorado families =
-- job creation, equal pay for equal work, rolling back Citizens United, =
and more -- and all the good work we've done is at risk if the special =
interest-backed candidates win.

Kay Hagan has been the target of more Koch money than any other Senator. =
Mark Begich is fighting in the most expensive race in Alaska history =
thanks to millions in outside spending by the Kochs' and Karl Rove's =
groups.=20

Mark Pryor is facing an opponent who sided with the Tea Party against =
Arkansas farmers, while Mary Landrieu's opponent has voted multiple times =
to end Medicare as we know it.=20

And my friend Mark Udall is running in a tight race against an opponent =
who is doing everything he can to run from his anti-choice record. To this =
day, he is a sponsor of a federal "personhood" bill.

These five races could be the difference between a senate that works for =
American families, and a senate that would work for the special interests. =
Give these five Democrats a grassroots boost by joining our moneybomb.

Thanks for your help.
