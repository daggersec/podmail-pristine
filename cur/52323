John --

Ninety-five years ago, the 19th Amendment was certified to
guarantee the right to vote for women. Today, we celebrate
Women's Equality Day in honor of that milestone.

But today is also a day to reflect on how far we still have
to go -- in the spirit of those women who protested and
organized for a fundamental right nearly a century ago, we
must do more to ensure equality for all women.

That means equal pay for equal work, and it means freedom in
reproductive health choices. It also means that working
women (and men) should have a right to paid sick days and
better family leave, because nobody should have to choose
between keeping their job and caring for a sick child or
parent.

I've been fighting for these issues since I took office --
and OFA is organizing around them right now. Add your name
to join them in standing up for women's rights:

https://www.barackobama.com/Womens-Equality-Day/

When I was a child, my grandmother became one of the first
female bank vice presidents in Hawaii. She was a pioneer.

And today we're seeing more and more firsts. Women are Army
Rangers. They're NFL coaches, and referees. And the 114th
Congress includes more than 100 women for the very first
time.

That's visible progress, and it's worth celebrating. But I
refuse to stop fighting now -- for the sake of my daughters
and yours, we must do better to make sure women are
respected and treated equally.

The path toward that future is going to be built by
organizers like you -- join OFA or do whatever you can to
say you'll fight for it:

Thanks,

Barack Obama
