it:

ocrats-financial-crisis

Herbert and Marion Sandler (played by Darrell Hammond and Casey Wilson =
respectively), the former banking moguls now with clear financial ties =
to ultra-leftwing outlets such as the Center for American Progress and =
Media Matters for America, were exposed as major players in the subprime =
mortgage market before they sold their company, Golden West Financial, =
to Wachovia. Under their captioned names on screen, the words "People =
who should be shot" were displayed.=20

Fyi:  i am with a friend who works at promontory financial -- gene =
ludwig's banking firm -- a good dem but possible that wachovia was their =
client. But his reaction to mimi mager (this is a busy train) mentioning =
sandlers on snl was chilling. ("They have giant target on their back," =
he said, and "NO ONE will have any sympathy for them" etc.) =20

Fyi -- from note jakobovics wrote to me on this:

From what I've seen generally reported, it was the option ARMs that all =
went bad as property values tanked b/c the option to choose the payment =
disappears once you hit an LTV of 105. In general, they were structured =
so that you had several years with the option of minimal payment, with =
the interest shortfall added to the loan balance. When values fell, =
however, the higher payments kicked in sooner than expected. I think for =
a lot of those borrowers, it wasn't an interest-rate adjustment =
generated payment shock but rather hitting the full payment period much =
sooner than anticipated.=20
To the extent things are getting reported as subprime, it's probably =
because the media isn't distinguishing between non-traditional loan =
products and "subprimes." It's sort of just another piece of the =
misnomer that all subprimes are predatory or that all ARMs are bad.

I cant watch again now on train and I forget the script exactly but it =
suggested they walked away with billions from havng done illegal and =
immoral lending.  Cant remember if they used word subprime. =20

I did skim some news clips and it appears default rates on their stuff =
was high (herb says not more so than others) and the losses were key to =
almsot wachovia failure -- athough herb emphasizes that they were only =
one of the institutions problems.  so we should try to understand these =
facts and get them right in pushback. =20

I reached out to martin eakes too and will try to reach him.  In some =
ways they (esp their california office) are most knowledgable and in =
best position to say what characteristics of golden west portfolio was =
and why this was unfair.  Not sure their comfort zone.

Did herb sound like he' d' talked to martin?=20



I suspect there is a movement of wachovia employees who are angry and =
may be driving some of this. =20

For some reason I lost audio on my laptop. So I haven't heard what they =
said in the skit.  Were they portrayed as subprime lenders? They didn't =
do any subprimes.  I did see should be shot label.  Talked to Herb. They =
are obviosly upset.  Weird that snl  should pick them out. They did =
soros too so maybe this is one of those right wing writers ala ABC 9/11. =


At any rate, we should figure out a way to push back.=20

My impression had always been that while world savings/golden west led =
in the area of adjustible rate mortgages they did so with pretty =
conservative underwriting and underwrote to the fully indexed rate.  =
That is certainly not the impression on gets from the current media and =
I tried to figure out how i know that and i cant find anything to that =
effect in a quick review.  Whatever the case there, given their role in =
CRL and advocacy for sound underwriting practices the charactchure (sp?) =
is unfair. =20
