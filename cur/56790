Hillary Clinton indicated there is little daylight between the economic
vision President Obama laid out in Tuesday night's State of the Union
address and her own.



Moments after Obama wrapped up his hourlong speech, Clinton, who is getting
closer to making a decision about a 2016 presidential run, took to Twitter
to say that Obama "pointed (the) way to an economy that works for all."



"Now we need to step up & deliver for the middle class," Clinton wrote,
adding the hashtags "fair shot" and "fair share" to her tweet.

The message gives a glimpse into the economic message the would-be
presidential candidate is crafting for what would be her second bid for the
White House.



It was the second time in a week that Clinton shared a message about the
economy on the social media platform. On Friday, Clinton appealed to
progressives in the Democratic Party by writing, "Attacking financial
reform is risky and wrong. Better for Congress to focus on jobs and wages
for middle class families."



Clinton allies say the former secretary of State will endorse most of
Obama's economic policies on the campaign trail, showing little space
between her and her former boss and onetime rival.



The allies say her campaign is likely to focus on middle-class issues,
including women's issues.

Clinton, a likely presidential candidate and former secretary of State,
made no mention of foreign policy in her tweet. Like Obama, she stressed
the need to =E2=80=9Cstep up and deliver for the middle class.=E2=80=9D



Obama touted such proposals as tax cuts for the middle class, free
community college tuition, paid sick leave and a tripling of the child care
tax credit in his sixth State of the Union Address.



Republicans, not surprisingly, rejected Obama=E2=80=99s ideas and criticize=

president for proposing to raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for
middle-class tax cuts.

Heading into Tuesday=E2=80=99s sixth State of the Union address by Presiden=
t Obama
with his poll numbers rising, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi her
strategy for confronting total GOP control of Congress was to keep taking
the economic equality message to the public. In an interview with MSNBC=E2=
=80=99s
Andrea Mitchell, the San Francisco Democrat also said she has urged
Democrats to find common ground with Republicans and the White House on the
coming trade debate to try to influence the end result, and she answered
=E2=80=9Cyes, yes=E2=80=9D to whether former Secretary of State Hillary Cli=
nton will be the
Democratic nominee and win the presidency.



As for which Republican Pelosi think would be the toughest for Clinton to
beat, Pelosi said, if she knew she wouldn=E2=80=99t say, but =E2=80=9CI don=
=E2=80=99t know who that
is anyway.=E2=80=9D



Pelosi said her plan is to move public opinion toward the new Democratic
position on a massive middle class tax cut paid for by a fee on Wall
Street, as laid out by her House Budget Committee ranking Democrat Chris
Van Hollen.



Pelosi noted that even Republican presidential candidates are taking a more
populist approach (see Mitt Romney=E2=80=99s war on poverty). =E2=80=9CPubl=
ic sentiment is
everything,=E2=80=9D Pelosi said. =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m kind of calm about t=
his=E2=80=A6.I see this as an
opportunity for us.=E2=80=9D



The coming push for trade promotion authority by the White House and
Republicans is already pitting Democrats against Obama, looking very much
like a replay of the NAFTA debate that had former President Bill Clinton
allied with Republicans. Pelosi said she was urging Democrats to try to
maintain leverage.



=E2=80=9CWhat we=E2=80=99re saying to the White House, we can find a path t=
o yes if there=E2=80=99s
transparency,=E2=80=9D Pelosi said, describing trade authority as a bill
=E2=80=9Cnegotiated in secret by the president=E2=80=9D and given to Congre=
ss to vote up or
down, as so-called fast track trade authority is traditionally done.



=E2=80=9CWhat I say to my own people is, the more we look willing to cooper=
ate, the
more we might be able to bring them over to prioritizing America=E2=80=99s
workers,=E2=80=9D Pelosi said. =E2=80=9CThe president says that, but we wan=
t to make sure
the bill does that. But if we say we=E2=80=99re not voting for anything, th=
ey=E2=80=99ll go
all the way to the extreme and it will only be about financial services
industry and more of the same that we=E2=80=99ve seen.=E2=80=9D



On the Hillary candidacy, Pelosi said Clinton would be =E2=80=9Cone of the =
best
prepared people to enter the White House in a long time,=E2=80=9D downplayi=
ng
progressive dismay about a Clinton candidacy and interest in a more
populist alternative such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.



=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve had my own disagreements even with the White House on=
 some of the
proposals that have come forth,=E2=80=9D Pelosi said. =E2=80=9CBut that=E2=

Democratic party. We love each other. Let other versions exist.=E2=80=9D

[Subtitle:] His State of the Union address lays down a marker for 2016
candidates.



President Barack Obama said Tuesday night that he has no more races to
run=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CI won both of them,=E2=80=9D he boasted=E2=80=94but do=
n't be fooled: He's playing in
2016.



Few=E2=80=94if any=E2=80=94of Obama's boldest proposals in Tuesday's State =
of the Union
address stand a good chance of becoming reality. Free community college?
Already rejected by Republicans. Increasing the capital gains tax? Violates
a key tenet of Republican ideology. Bank fees? A plan that seemingly, only
Elizabeth Warren could love.



The long-shot nature of this wish list begs the question: Why focus on
priorities destined to fail? The answer may have more to do with Hillary
Clinton than Barack Obama. With no more political campaigns of his own left
to run, Obama is focused on the future, and he seems determined to set his
party on a leftward course, with or without Clinton's consent.



Rather than use his State of the Union to push modest proposals for his
final two years in office, a gleeful, confident Obama outlined an ambitious
economic vision. =E2=80=9CWill we accept an economy where only a few of us =
do
spectacularly well?=E2=80=9D he asked. =E2=80=9COr will we commit ourselves=
 to an economy
that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the
effort?=E2=80=9D



White House aides say Obama wasn't focused on 2016 when he crafted the
speech. =E2=80=9CHe has two years left, two years is a long time, but he al=
so feels
an urgency to get very strong ideas out there and try and make it
bipartisan,=E2=80=9D White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri =
said on
Bloomberg Politics' =E2=80=9CWith All Due Respect=E2=80=9D Tuesday afternoo=
n. She has a
point: While the focus in recent days has been on the president's plans to
raise new taxes on the wealthy and redistribute wealth to the middle class,
Obama is also playing a much quieter game of courting Republicans to cut
trade and corporate tax deals opposed by his liberal base. Those
initiatives may also shape 2016 by taking off the table a Republican
argument that Democratic administrations will stall pro-business policies.



Still, Obama's larger economic vision echoed that that of a prominent
Democrat=E2=80=94just not the one leading the primary field. =E2=80=9CSenat=
or Warren has
very much driven this conversation for the past two years,=E2=80=9D said Il=
ya
Sheyman, political director of Moveon.org Political Action. =E2=80=9CThis s=
peaks to
the growing influence of progressives in the party.=E2=80=9D



The agenda, which Obama dubbed =E2=80=9Cmiddle-class economics,=E2=80=9D en=
compasses a
sweeping set of proposals including new tax breaks for families, universal
preschool, increasing the minimum wage, lowering mortgage premiums, and
ensuring paid sick days and family leave for workers. =E2=80=9CThe idea tha=
t this
country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their
fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules,=E2=80=9D he said. =E2=
=80=9CWe don=E2=80=99t
just want everyone to share in America=E2=80=99s success=E2=80=94we want ev=

contribute to our success.=E2=80=9D



Many of these initiatives have long been on the wish lists of the
Democratic progressive wing, and Warren praised the president's speech.



But Clinton, with her Wall Street donors and her husband's embrace of
Rubinomics, is more closely tied to the party's pro-business faction. By
choosing to make this prime-time moment about inequality, Obama boxes
Clinton into making a choice between the two. Though she responded swiftly
on Twitter, she almost certainly will be asked for further opinion on his
proposals and, even if she's not officially a candidate, her answers will
be viewed in the context of a expected presidential bid.



Progressive activists have spent months pushing Warren to run, despite her
repeated insistence that she has no intention of doing so. =E2=80=9CSome of=
 the
jockeying now is trying to strategically make sure Hillary understands that
she can't be an economic moderate without generating pushback,=E2=80=9D sai=
d Andy
Stern, the former head of the Service Employees International Union, told
Bloomberg Politics last month.



Obama's address gives a major boost to their efforts to drive the 2016
debate leftward. Already, Clinton has attempted to align herself with
middle class interests. Last week, she tweeted her way into a congressional
dispute over Republican efforts to roll back financial regulations, an
unusual step for a politician who generally shies away from wading into
active policy debates.



Republicans argue that Obama's economic policies will only hurt Clinton.
They say the results of the 2014 midterm elections, in which Republicans
won back the Senate and expanded on their majority in the House, repudiated
those policies. =E2=80=9CIt puts her in a very difficult position,=E2=80=9D=
 Republican
pollster David Winston said of Hillary Clinton. =E2=80=9CThe public has sai=
d in
exit polls they don't agree with that argument. And she's supposed to carry
that ball?=E2=80=9D



Mitt Romney, considering a third presidential bid, accused the president of
being =E2=80=9Cmore intent on winning elections than on winning progress=E2=
=80=9D in a
Facebook post:



[FACEBOOK POST]



But Republicans, too, have been putting economic mobility issues at the
center of their political messages. =E2=80=9CMillions of our fellow citizen=
s across
the broad middle class feel as if the American Dream is now out of their
reach,=E2=80=9D wrote former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in the missions stat=
ement of
his new political action committee. Those kinds of sentiments on issues
like wage stagnation and poverty have been echoed by other potential
Republican presidential candidates. Romney has cast himself as a champion
of the country's poorest.



Those Republicans might be the president's true target. The White House
knows that if there's been one constant in the Obama era it's this: For
Republicans, siding with the president is akin to committing political
suicide. But coming out against popular proposals and being seen as
obstructionists might just be worse=E2=80=94or so Democrats hope. =E2=80=9C=
The president's
proposals are a win-win for the Democrats,=E2=80=9D said longtime Clinton a=

By Peter Baker

January 20, 2015



WASHINGTON =E2=80=94 Near the end of his State of the Union address, Presid=
ent
Obama noted, =E2=80=9CI have no more campaigns to run.=E2=80=9D A few Repub=
licans in the
audience cheekily applauded.



Mr. Obama smiled but then offered an ad-lib retort: =E2=80=9CI know,=E2=80=
=9D he jabbed the
Republicans, =E2=80=9Cbecause I won both of them.=E2=80=9D



Never mind that his party actually lost the most recent elections,
delivering control of both houses of Congress to the opposition for the
first time during his presidency. For an hour on Tuesday night, Mr. Obama
commanded the biggest stage he will have all year, unbowed and
self-assured, laying out an expansive and expensive legislative agenda as
if he were the one who had triumphed.



Watching an emboldened Mr. Obama, it would have been easy to forget that he
was standing there just two months after the biggest electoral repudiation
of his presidency. Indeed, with economic indicators on the rise and his own
poll numbers rebounding slightly, he made no reference at all to the
midterm elections, offered no concessions about his own leadership and
proposed no compromises to accommodate the political reality.



Instead, he asked congressional Republicans who have resisted new taxes at
every turn over the last six years to raise taxes on the wealthy. He asked
lawmakers who won their seats on promises of reining in government to
reopen the spending spigot to provide free community college, child care
and paid parental leave to millions of middle-income Americans. The program
he outlined sounded pretty much like the one he would have sent to a
Democratic Congress.



=E2=80=9CIf you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the w=
ork at
hand,=E2=80=9D he told lawmakers. =E2=80=9CIf you disagree with parts of it=
, I hope you=E2=80=99ll
at least work with me where you do agree. And I commit to every Republican
here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work
with you to make this country stronger.=E2=80=9D



But after the lights went out and the presidential motorcade had made its
way back up Pennsylvania Avenue, the party balance had not changed. For all
of Mr. Obama=E2=80=99s confident demeanor, the question raised by the speec=
h was
whether advancing initiatives with little or no hope of passage constituted
an act of bold leadership or a feckless waste of time.



Every president throws out ideas in a State of the Union address knowing
they will not succeed, at least not right away =E2=80=94 to frame the debat=
e, lay
down an opening bid, draw a line against opponents or set the stage for
future action. But rarely has the disconnect between a president and
Congress seemed as wide as it is now.



Unlike President Bill Clinton, who moved to co-opt Republican issues like
crime and welfare on his own terms when the other party captured Congress,
Mr. Obama tacked left even as Capitol Hill tacked right. Rather than
declare the end of big government, he responded with a defense of an
activist Washington.



Mr. Obama=E2=80=99s advisers said he saw little reason to hold back on his
ambitions just because the new Republican majorities were unlikely to go
along. Jon Favreau, his former chief speechwriter, said that pre-emptively
scaling back his goals would be like going into a job interview and asking
for the salary the employer was likely to give rather than bargaining for
more.



=E2=80=9CNow, do I personally think the Republicans will be willing to meet=
 the
president halfway on tax reform?=E2=80=9D Mr. Favreau said. =E2=80=9CNo, bu=
t that shouldn=E2=80=99t
stop the president from proposing a solution that he feels would actually
help solve the problem.=E2=80=9D



But Republicans said Mr. Obama risked looking ineffectual and out of touch
if he simply promoted initiatives that Congress would never take seriously.



Steve Schmidt, who worked in President George W. Bush=E2=80=99s White House=
 and
managed Senator John McCain=E2=80=99s campaign against Mr. Obama in 2008, s=
aid
proposing free community college for most students and more paid family
leave for parents seemed ludicrously unrealistic.



=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a student-body presidency campaign component to th=
is =E2=80=94 no more
homework and go home at 1 p.m.,=E2=80=9D Mr. Schmidt said. He added, =E2=80=
=9CYou would
expect he would gain the political maturity to come into the Congress with
an open hand instead of a clenched fist.=E2=80=9D



John Feehery, a former top adviser to Republican congressional leaders,
said there was still value in a president=E2=80=99s making long-shot propos=
als.
=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s important for setting the contours of the debate and =
for sparking the
imagination of the listening audience,=E2=80=9D Mr. Feehery said. =E2=80=9C=
It helps if you
don=E2=80=99t get laughed out of the room, but it=E2=80=99s hard to know wh=
at will be
viewed as inspirational and what will be seen as insipid.=E2=80=9D



Even without congressional support, promoting his ideas allows Mr. Obama to
force other political actors to respond. And he can point to past efforts
that did not succeed in Congress but produced progress on other levels.
Although he has failed to push through an increase in the minimum wage, for
example, a number of states have responded to his appeals and raised it on
their own.



=E2=80=9CWith north of 30 million viewers tuning in, the State of the Union=
 is the
Super Bowl of political events,=E2=80=9D said Josh Gottheimer, a former
speechwriter for Mr. Clinton. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s an opportunity for a pr=
esident to drive
a new proposal down the field, regardless of legislative viability, and
literally change the debate in one fell swoop.=E2=80=9D



Michael Waldman, another former Clinton speechwriter, said it would be a
mistake for a president to let legislative politics stop him from proposing
what he supports. =E2=80=9CWe don=E2=80=99t know what the big debates and p=
olicy fights of
the post-Obama era will be,=E2=80=9D Mr. Waldman said. =E2=80=9CHe is putti=
ng in his 2
cents. Perhaps Obama=E2=80=99s ideas won=E2=80=99t get enacted. But the Rep=
ublican
leadership=E2=80=99s ideas won=E2=80=99t get enacted either.=E2=80=9D



Yet critics said Mr. Obama might be making life more difficult for his
would-be successor, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton,
because his agenda could nudge her away from the middle in 2016. =E2=80=9CH=
e=E2=80=99s not
just pushing her,=E2=80=9D said David Frum, who was a speechwriter for Mr. =
Bush,
=E2=80=9Cbut to change the party around her to constrain her.=E2=80=9D



Mr. Frum added that although Mr. Obama hoped his agenda would put
Republicans on the defense, it might have the opposite effect. =E2=80=9CThi=
s is a
document that unifies Republicans,=E2=80=9D he said.



It may also unify Democrats, leaving both sides as divided as ever. Mr.
Obama dismissed any suggestion that he had any role in the division. He
rebuffed =E2=80=9Cthe pundits=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cthe cynics=E2=80=9D who=
 called him =E2=80=9Cmisguided, na=C3=AFve=E2=80=9D
to have promised to bridge Washington=E2=80=99s divide.



=E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s amazing what you can bounce back from when you have t=
o,=E2=80=9D he said,
quoting a young mother whose family had emerged from the economic troubles
of recent years. For a moment, he sounded as if he meant himself.

Mitt Romney will charge Mississippi State University $50,000 to deliver a
lecture on campus next week, most of which will go to charity =E2=80=94 a
dramatically lower fee than the $250,000 to $300,000 Hillary Rodham Clinton
requires for her university lectures.



Romney =E2=80=94 the 2012 Republican presidential nominee who is weighing a=
 third
run for the White House =E2=80=94 will speak as part of the university=E2=
=80=99s Global
Lecture Series, a speaking series administered by the student government, a
university official said.



Romney has directed that most of his $50,000 fee go to Charity Vision, a
nonprofit organization that partners with doctors to provide free eye
surgeries that is led by one of Romney=E2=80=99s sons, according to a contr=
act
obtained Monday by The Washington Post under a public records request to
the university. The remaining portion of the amount will be set aside to
cover Romney=E2=80=99s travel, according to the contract.



Romney=E2=80=99s fee stands in stark contrast to Clinton=E2=80=99s, the pre=
sumptive 2016
Democratic front-runner who has spoken to dozens of industry associations,
Wall Street banks, universities and other groups.



The former secretary of state=E2=80=99s speaking fees at universities have
typically also gone to a family-connected charity =E2=80=94 in her case, th=
e Bill,
Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. However, her high fees have drawn
campus protests and sharp criticisms from Republicans, who have said they
demonstrate a likely presidential candidate who has grown out of touch.



At the University of California Los Angeles, Clinton=E2=80=99s $300,000 fee
prompted a university official to inquire with her speaking agency whether
the university could receive a discount. The official was told that the
$300,000 was her special university rate.



She is scheduled to deliver two paid speeches Wednesday in Canada at events
sponsored by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.



Romney=E2=80=99s speaking schedule has received less attention, particularl=
y since
his return to the private sector following his loss in 2012. According to a
financial disclosure released during that campaign, he collected more than
$360,000 in speaking fees in 2011 from appearances at Barclay=E2=80=99s Ban=
k,
Goldentree Asset Management and other companies.



Sid Salter, a spokesman for Mississippi State University, said the former
Massachusetts governor was chosen by the campus=E2=80=99s student leadershi=
p for
the annual lecture. Past speakers have included former secretary of state
Condoleeza Rice and broadcaster Dan Rather. He said Romney=E2=80=99s fee is=
 on the
low end for the series, which is funded using a portion of sales taxes
collected from on-campus sales.



=E2=80=9CMitt Romney is not going to personally receive any compensation fo=
r the
speech,=E2=80=9D Romney spokesman Colin Reed said. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s al=
l going to Charity
Vision and travel costs.=E2=80=9D



The Chartwell Worldwide Speakers Bureau, which represents Romney,
advertises on its Web site that he offers =E2=80=9Ca clear vision of the ke=
y
challenges facing America and the world=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cwill bring a =
huge draw to any
event or conference.=E2=80=9D



According to the contract, Romney will spend about six hours on campus,
including a reception for students, a VIP meeting and an hour-long lecture,
including a question-and-answer session. He is then tentatively scheduled
to attend a dinner with alumni.



Clinton tends to spend less time on the ground with each appearance,
typically attending a short reception prior to her speech. A university
official at UCLA asked that groups be prepared to snap photos with her
before she arrived, noting that Clinton =E2=80=9Cdoesn=E2=80=99t like to st=
and around
waiting for people.=E2=80=9D



Romney=E2=80=99s contracts set some limitations similar to Clinton=E2=80=99=
s, such as
banning the university from releasing recordings of his speech without his
permission and requiring his sign-off for promotional materials. It
outlines no requirements for luxury amenities, such as food or equipment in
his green room, though it is possible those kinds of requests have been
made by his representatives in private communications with the university.



Romney has long been a supporter of Charity Vision, a Provo, Utah-based
organization that provides medical care to people in the developing world.
The group=E2=80=99s president is one of Romney=E2=80=99s sons, Josh.



In 2013, Mitt and Ann Romney, along with their family and friends, traveled
to rural Peru on a mission for Charity Vision. There, they helped conduct
eye exams for local villagers, including many children. In a video
promoting the trip, Mitt Romney described eye screenings at a local school.

Eight years ago, on Jan. 20, 2007, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton made it
official: She was in the race for the presidency, and she was in to =E2=80=
=9Cto
win,=E2=80=9D she said in a video on her website, seated on a floral couch =
in her
living room. History had other plans, and Clinton=E2=80=99s campaign collap=
sed
under the weight of infighting and misguided strategy as Barack Obama
seemingly came out of nowhere to rob her of the Democratic nomination.



Now, with Democrats putting all their political eggs in Clinton=E2=80=99s b=
asket to
save the party in 2016, they are anxiously waiting to see if the former
secretary of state has learned from her mistakes of 2008, should she decide
to run again.



Promising new leadership, a new message and new strategy, Clinton allies
say the former secretary of state is under no illusion about what went
wrong in 2008 and is eager to learn from her mistakes =E2=80=93 but some wo=
nder if
she=E2=80=99s too busy fighting the last battle to win the next one.



The loss was devastating for Clinton, as she wrote in her 2014 memoir,
=E2=80=9CHard Choices,=E2=80=9D and it took her time to understand what wen=
t went wrong. =E2=80=9CI
really didn=E2=80=99t have a good strategy for my campaign,=E2=80=9D she to=
ld ABC News last
year. =E2=80=9CI didn=E2=80=99t plan it the right way =E2=80=A6 I let peopl=
e down.=E2=80=9D



Since then, the former secretary of state has been preoccupied with not
repeating the mistakes. =E2=80=9CI think it will be profoundly different,=
=E2=80=9D said
Democratic strategist Bob Shrum. =E2=80=9CShe will offer a sense of vision =
about
the future,=E2=80=9D and not be a candidate =E2=80=9Cof restoration,=E2=80=
=9D he said.



The addition of new blood into the Clinton high command represents the most
dramatic shift apparent so far. Gone from the very top ranks of the
prospective campaign are long-time Clinton loyalists, with baggage and
institutional knowledge, and in are new faces to Clinton=E2=80=99s world, m=
any from
Obama=E2=80=99s. If you can=E2=80=99t beat them hire them, the thinking goe=
s.



To replace Mark Penn, who advised Clinton to downplay her potentially
historic role as a woman in the top echelon of politics and project an aura
of inevitability, Clinton hired former Obama pollster Joel Benenson as her
chief strategist. Jim Margolis, Obama=E2=80=99s ad maker, is expected to be
Clinton=E2=80=99s media consultant, replacing the team that made the couch
announcement video. Meanwhile, Clinton=E2=80=99s pollsters and field direct=
ors are
also likely to be Obama alums, as are top officials at the main big-money
super PAC supporting her bid.



=E2=80=9CShe=E2=80=99s certainly bringing in a broader perspective and new =
talent, and I
think that=E2=80=99s a good sign,=E2=80=9D said Stephanie Cutter, a Democra=
tic strategist
who sat out the 2008 Democratic primary before signing on with Obama for
the general election.



Allies say Clinton has proven she can run a good campaign =E2=80=93 it just=
 came
too late. In the waning days of 2008, after it was clear the nomination was
slipping away, Clinton became warm with voters and an underdog populist on
the stump, while shaking up her team at headquarters.



Former top Obama strategist David Axelrod has said Clinton was a bad
candidate in 2007, but a good one in 2008 after she lost the Iowa caucuses
in early January. =E2=80=9COnce she wasn=E2=80=99t the frontrunner anymore,=
 once she was
fighting for her place, she threw all the caution away and I think she
started relating to voters in a much more visceral way that reflected who
she really is,=E2=80=9D Axelrod said recently while waiting for a potential=
 Clinton
arrive at an event he was hosting in Chicago. =E2=80=9CIf I had any advice =
for her,
it would be: Be that person.=E2=80=9D



It=E2=80=99s still too early to know whether she will be that person, and a=
n
upheaval is always one campaign shakeup away.



To clamp down on in-fighting, which plagued the 2008 campaign, Clinton is
expected to enlist John Podesta, a former White House chief of staff under
President Bill Clinton who imposed order during the particularly difficult
times of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.



The typically low-key Podesta is famous for having an alter ego, or =E2=80=
=9Cevil
twin=E2=80=9D named Skippy whose acerbic tongue makes sure things stay on t=
rack and
people behave.  When he took over as chief of staff in November of 1998 he
joked he told reporters that he values his staff, in addition to talent and
experience, is people who can =E2=80=9Cwork together as a team. The Preside=

deserves that; the country deserves that; and so does the White House
staff.=E2=80=9D



Clinton and her team were blindsided by the success of Obama in 2008, but
they=E2=80=99re keeping closer watch on potential threats from the left thi=
s time
around. Her staff and outside allies follow Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth
Warren closely, keeping an eye on her speeches and public appearances. In
Iowa, where Clinton campaigned for Senate candidate Bruce Braley and other
Democrats last year, her team inquired how Warren=E2=80=99s appearances in =
the
state been attended and what the enthusiasm level was like.



=E2=80=9CI think that she=E2=80=99s very sensitive to this Elizabeth Warren=
 trying to paint
her as being identified with Wall Street,=E2=80=9D longtime Clinton friend =
and
donor Alan Patricof recently said on Bloomberg TV. =E2=80=9CAnd I don=E2=80=
=99t think it=E2=80=99s
true, frankly, because it=E2=80=99s just part of her base, and I think she =
can
willingly sacrifice some of that base to bring herself to a position where
she=E2=80=99s not identified with it.=E2=80=9D



Clinton herself has made entries to the restive liberal base, meeting with
progressive activists sometimes critical of her style of politics and
embracing Warren=E2=80=99s rhetoric where she can.



The former presidential candidate also struggled in her relations with the
media, with a hostile style that bred resentment and distrust. While
nothing is official, operatives rumored to be in the running for top jobs
in a Clinton communication shop say they hope for a different approach and
fresh start with the press. Her old top press handlers, including Phil
Singer and Howard Wolfson, are not expected to reenlist. =E2=80=9CIt has to=
 be
different this time around. It=E2=80=99s not an option. And it will,=E2=80=
=9D said one
Democratic communications operative who hopes to be involved in the
campaign.



But with an announcement still likely months away, some allies wonder if
Clinton is to preoccupied with fighting her last battle.



=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a lot of people that are taking a look at this and=
 saying, we
agree this needs to be a different campaign from 2008, but just doing what
someone else did in 2012 doesn=E2=80=99t fundamentally fix what went wrong,=
=E2=80=9D said
one Clinton ally.



In speeches since stepping down as secretary of state, Clinton has mostly
avoided taking on the painful primary loss directly. It=E2=80=99s  =E2=80=
=9Ca little bit
ancient history,=E2=80=9D she joked during a speech at UCLA last year. Now =
she=E2=80=99s
hoping history does not repeat itself.
