Dear Trustee,

                      Thank you for your response to my request.  The good
news is that we have 4 Trustees willing to serve as Chair Elect and that
many of you volunteered to be on the Nominating Committee.  The bylaws
require one Committee member be on the Executive Committee and one on the
Committee of Trustees.  It is required that we have no less than five and
that a former Chair is invited to participate.  I have appointed the
following committee that I believe is a good representation of the Board. I
have shared this list with the Executive Committee  and Teresa for input.
You all will be contacted in the near future for your recommendations on
filling this important position.  If you have any questions please let me
know.  I big thanks to Tom, Laura, Jan, Tino and Bud for their willingness
to serve on this Committee.



                                                     Duke


Chair Tom Anderson (Exec Committee representative)

Laura Rosene (COT representative)
Jan Sharry
Tino Schuler
Bud Potter

Former Chair will be invited to participate.
