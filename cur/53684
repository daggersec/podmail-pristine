When Hillary Clinton said she was going to hit the road, she meant it.

The newly declared presidential candidate is on her way to Iowa, from New
York, in a van after announcing her candidacy online Sunday afternoon.



The former secretary of state, who is trying to become the first female
president, is set to appear in Iowa =E2=80=94 the influential early-voting =
state =E2=80=94
on Tuesday for a series of small, private events.

While she has no planned stops on her road trip =E2=80=94 which was her own=
 idea =E2=80=94
the candidate stopped by a gas station in Pennsylvania on Sunday.

Clinton=E2=80=99s much-anticipated launch came in the form of a web video o=
n Sunday
afternoon, ending months of speculation about her intentions. Her campaign
kick-off is expected to include a series of low-key events with private
citizens, as opposed to large speeches =E2=80=94 and her road trip reflects=
 that
plan. The presumptive Democratic front-runner is not planning any major
speeches or campaign rallies until May.
