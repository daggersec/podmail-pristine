Friend -- I have some big news to share.

Yesterday, we submitted our first financial report of 2013,
and it contained a big number: $5.1 million raised in
January, February, and March. That's the most money any
gubernatorial candidate has raised in the first quarter, in
at least the last five elections.

And while I'm proud of that top line figure, it's what's
behind it that has me beaming from ear to ear. Here's
exactly how we got to $5.1 million:

* Over 5,100 people pitched in and gave what they could

* In a true display of grassroots support, 73 percent of our
donations were $100 or less

* About 3 in 4 donations came from the Commonwealth

There's no denying it: our grassroots momentum is growing.
After all, this isn't Terry's campaign -- all of us own a
piece of it.

Because you're an integral part of this movement, we want to
hear from you. Will you answer our quick five-question
survey and tell us what'd you like to see from this
campaign?

http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/page/s/q1-survey

While our opponent is off collecting $1.5 million checks
from radical anti-choice groups, we're building a true
grassroots support network. And our work is far from done,
since I can guarantee that won't be the only extremist group
filling Cuccinelli's campaign account.

This is just the beginning, but it's a start we can all be
proud of.

Thanks for being a part of it,

Andrew Smith
Finance Director
Terry McAuliffe for Governor
