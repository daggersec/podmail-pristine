John I hope your first week at WH was good and you felt comfortable in your n=
ew but old environment.
A guestion: During all these years I have tried to somewhat help this Admini=
stration with no luck.I was always surprised but then,not that much,when I l=
earned later from others closer to this Administration, that they  recieved s=
imilar treatment.
This introduction is to offer my services to head or be part of the Advence t=
rip to Mexico for the President's visit in late February.I have offered my s=
ervices a couple of times in these 5 years to do Advance but the answer was n=
o answer to my request or it was too late,sorry.
Anyhow,it never hurts to ask.Thank you. PS I hope at least this time there a=
re Members of the Hispanic Caucus included.
