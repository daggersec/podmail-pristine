League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund


Dear John,=A0

In 35 years as an environmental advocate, I thought I'd seen all of the oil=
 industry's dirty tactics. But this election, science itself is under attac=
k, and I'm shocked and troubled by how far they are going to elect climate =
change deniers to Congress.=A0=A0

Veteran environmental leaders Russ Feingold, Barbara Boxer, Harry Reid, and=
 other Senate candidates are facing the toughest races of their careers aga=
inst industry-backed candidates like Ron Johnson, failed CEO Carly Fiorina,=
 and Sharron Angle, who deny the science behind climate change.

In the House, clean energy champions who last year voted for the historic c=
limate bill - leaders like Tom Perriello, John Boccieri, Mark Schauer, and =
others - are facing an onslaught of false and misleading attack ads from sh=
adowy special interest groups.

That's why I'm asking you, today, to support LCV Victory Fund. They have th=
e experience and the expertise to defeat these climate deniers and elect en=
vironmental leaders who will fight for science-based laws that protect our =
nation and our planet.

Join me in making sure sound science drives legislation by making a contrib=
ution to LCV Victory Fund today.

http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Di1uTuh0jVd0bOWWo6OD4Xw..

Time and again, LCV Victory Fund wins critical races. They know how to choo=
se their targets, execute their strategy, and mobilize their tremendous gra=
ssroots network to make sure voters know the facts and get to the polls.

I had the honor to work with Sens. Feingold, Boxer, and Reid - and I deeply=
 respect their environmental accomplishments.=A0 But dirty campaign tricks =
- misleading advertisements, distorted records, and personal attacks - can =
be aimed at even the most respected environmental champions.=A0 And that's =
exactly what the oil companies are doing to these Senators.

Last year, the House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy an=
d Security Act by just seven votes. But if we lost champions like Reps. Per=
riello, Boccieri and Schauer in the House, it would only make it harder to =
advance policies that protect our air and water, and climate - be it effort=
s to boost wind and solar power or defend against efforts to gut the Clean =
Air Act. If we replace Reps.
Perriello, Boccieri, Schauer and other leaders with politicians backed by t=
he oil and coal companies, we would risk turning back decades of environmen=
tal progress.

The environmental champions that LCV Victory Fund is working to elect and p=
rotect are the kinds of lawmakers we need now more than ever. They can be c=
ounted on to take a stand against corporate polluters. They understand and =
heed scientists' warnings about climate change's disastrous impacts. They m=
ust win this November if we're going to move forward into a clean energy fu=
ture.

John, we can't afford to let this opportunity slip away - help make sure LC=
V Victory Fund reaches its $70,000 goal by October 29th.

http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Db-G4-z82yL6ZmBM6Dpompw..

I've followed LCV Victory Fund's work. And I can assure you that your contr=
ibution today will go straight to work for some of the most efficient, effe=
ctive campaigns I've seen.

We still have time to change minds. But with early voting already underway =
in several states, every moment counts. If you believe in science-driven po=
licy, if you hope to protect our planet for our children and grandchildren,=
 please, give what you can today.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Al Gore
