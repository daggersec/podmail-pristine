Hello everyone -

In the past there have been some logistical issues with granting RA positio=
ns to evening students who are also full-time Georgetown employees, whether=
 here or on main campus. I'm writing to let you all know that I think we've=
 solved them. If you want to sign up as an RA an evening student who is alr=
eady a full-time employee of Georgetown, please contact me about how it can=
 work. And please do consider reaching out to our evening students as RAs -=
- it's a great way for them to get to make stronger connections on campus, =
which can be a special challenge if you're here part time.

... greg
