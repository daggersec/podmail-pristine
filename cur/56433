John,

We met briefly at the Clean Energy Summit in Las Vegas.  I am a Marine
Corps veteran and former California legislator who narrowly lost a campaign
for San Diego Mayor. I am also a long time Clinton fan and supporter.

I wanted to send you an email to share an experience from my Mayoral
campaign that could prove useful.  Many people smarter than me disagree but
I would not want to run against Marco Rubio in a general election.  The
issue of his missing votes has been raised. I had a similar problem when I
was a legislator running for Mayor.  Prior to the campaign, we actually
assessed the potential damage from missing votes and were assured by others
that it never resonated, they had tested, not to worry, etc.

However, my opponents used a slightly different approach.  They claimed I
didn=E2=80=99t show up to work.  They outlined the government salary I rece=
ived for
not showing up to work.  They very creatively (although not honestly)
counted the days I missed in Sacramento even when there were no votes
taking place to say I wasn=E2=80=99t there XX% of the days.  We initially i=
gnored
the hits because I had always been rated the =E2=80=9Chardest working=E2=80=
=9D and =E2=80=9Cmost
effective=E2=80=9D legislator, etc.

By the time we realized the damage done it was too late to respond.  The
other challenge is there isn=E2=80=99t a good response when you are an elec=
ted
official.  You are paid to do your job=E2=80=94not run for another office. =
 People
do resent that someone is getting a government paycheck (from them) and not
showing up to do their job.

Just a suggestion based on my very painful experience.

Hope your well.

Nathan
