Ad spending by independent groups rises in race's
homestretch<http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/07/ad-spending-by-=

Posted: 11:58 AM ET

*From* CNN Political Editor Mark
Preston<http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/tag/cnn-political-editor-mark-=
preston/>

*NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) =96* Pundits may have spent the year declaring =
the
passing of the 527 era =97 but the view from primary states this month is
beginning to make the reports of that death look just a bit premature.

*Insomniacs and second-shift workers tuning into Pittsburgh's WTAE early
Saturday morning saw a two-minute commercial claiming that Barack Obama
"arrogantly mocked" the Bible in a 2006 speech on religion.*

In a recent ad for the California Nurses Association that aired in
battleground states, an image of 72-year-old John McCain flashed on the
screen as a woman sang "One Heartbeat Away" =96 a not so subtle dig at the
Republican presidential nominee's age. The goal was to put doubt into
voters' minds about Sarah Palin's ability to step in as commander-in-chief
if something were to happen to McCain.

Veterans for Freedom has begun a multi-million dollar ad campaign against
Barack Obama that accuse the Democratic nominee of caring more about his
campaign than about troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

And BornAliveTruth.org, an anti-abortion group, is taking aim at Barack
Obama with a television ad featuring a 31-year-old woman whose mother
underwent a late-term abortion procedure unsuccessfully: if "Obama had his
way, I wouldn't be here," says Gianna Jessen in the new spot.

For the most part, these independent groups, many of which are called 527's
for their designation in the IRS tax code, had been relatively minor player=
s
during the 2008 presidential election season, as ambitious attempts to
organize major donors mostly foundered due to a lack of interest.

At this time four years ago, independent groups had spent $120 million on
commercials for the presidential race compared to the $13.2 million investe=
d
so far in this race, according to an analysis of political television ad
spending conducted for CNN by TNSMI-Campaign Media Analysis Group.


So far this election cycle, spending by anti-Obama and anti-McCain groups i=
s
dead even with each totaling $6.6 million so far this election cycle.* In
the last two weeks, Republican issue groups have spent $2.3 million, while
Democratic issue groups have accounted for about $1 million.*

But there has been a recent uptick in the frequency of third-party funded
ads, said Evan Tracey, CNN's consultant on television advertising.
MoveOn.org and the Service Employees International Union, which support
Obama, announced major new ad campaigns last month. So did the anti-Obama
conservative American Issues Project. And the pace is picking up: *Six new
groups have unveiled ads since Friday.*

"What we have seen over the past five days is indicative of what we are
going to see a lot of in the next four weeks," said Tracey, chief operating
officer of Campaign Media Analysis Group.

The strategy for many of these independent organizations is to make an
impression with deep-pocketed donors who can help fund the ad and take it t=
o
a new level.

In fact, PHForAmerica asks viewers to "help air this ad on TV as often as
possible" by making a donation to the organization.

"Even though an ad buy might be small now, remember these groups are
auditioning right now for late donations to take these ads to a larger
scope," Tracey said. "Remember, the Swift Boat original ad buy was less tha=
n
$1 million and ran in only a handful of small media markets."

PHForAmerica's ad first appeared as a Web video on YouTube, and drew a shar=
p
response from the Obama campaign, which said it was "full of outright lies"
and predicted the ad would never see air. Even though the ad had low
production quality, it did run at 1:24 a.m. ET =97 and the head of the grou=
p
said it will continue to do so, if only for now in the wee hours of the
morning.

In the Wild, Wild West of political ads, accuracy is not always important
and with 28 days remaining before Election Day =96 expect more independent
groups like PHForAmerica to take to the airwaves. The mission: act as a
disrupter, try to knock an opponent off-stride and in many cases call into
question a candidate's character, his patriotism =97 even his health and
mental status.

In one 30-second ad from Brave New PAC and Democracy for America released i=
n
mid-September, McCain's fellow prisoner of war Philip Butler described the
Republican nominee as "unfit to lead" =97 making the spot one of the first =
to
mention McCain's POW stint in a negative context.

Last week, the conservative group Judicial Confirmation Network launched a
TV ad that featured Barack Obama's ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the
controversial pastor who nearly derailed the Illinois senator's presidentia=
l
bid last spring, and tied Obama to William Ayers and convicted developer
Tony Rezko =96 tough attacks which have become central elements of the
McCain-Palin message against Obama in recent days.

None of these groups are allowed to communicate or coordinate with the
campaigns in any way because of federal campaign finance regulations.

Both Obama and McCain were highly critical of independent expenditure group=
s
during their respective primary contests, but the candidates have refrained
from condemning the wave of new ads.

And as the 2008 campaign heads into the homestretch, and the focus shifts t=
o
turning out the base, these independent groups will likely pour millions
more into last-minute ad buys. "These are going to have highly inflammatory
rhetoric that is going to be steered at base voters in swing states," said
Tracey. "They want to fire up the single issue voters."
