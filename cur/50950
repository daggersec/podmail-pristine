Hi John - Not sure how far along things are with Labor Secretary, but  
if Mary Beth Maxwell is being seriously considered, and you want my  
input, I'm happy to share what I know.  We were college student  
activists together back in the day, and a number of my friends have  
worked closely with her.  I do think she would send a strong signal to  
young people and the left and attract very top-level talent to work  
with her, some of whom might not otherwise consider working in  
government.

Best,
Steve
