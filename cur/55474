It is with great sadness that I write to inform you of the passing of Leona=
rd =93Len=94 Terr, a long-time adjunct faculty member in the graduate tax p=
rogram and partner at Baker & McKenzie.  Len was a global leader in interna=
tional tax law practice, and brought that expertise to his 17 years of teac=
hing at the Law Center, which included courses in Advanced International Ta=
xation, Advanced International Tax Policy, and most recently, our Internati=
onal Business Planning Workshop.  At the conclusion of this academic year, =
he was selected to receive Georgetown=92s Charles Fahy Distinguished Adjunc=
t Professor Award, for professors who have provided exceptional service to =
Georgetown in teaching, curriculum development, student counseling, and inv=
olvement in extra-curricular Law Center activities.  You can read Len=92s o=
bituary here: http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx=
?n=3Dleonard-b-terr&pid=3D175025440  There will be a memorial service held =
in the coming weeks, and we will share the details once they have been conf=
irmed.
