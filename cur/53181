Hi Robby
I defer to John on his conversation with Lee Saunders, but I spoke with
Brian Weeks this morning.  AFSCME has decided to delay their endorsement
vote until the third week of October.  The reasoning is that Lee wants to
get his board to a better position before they move forward.  Brian
reassured me (and will call you today too) that the endorsement is coming
it will just happen 3-4 weeks later.  This is disappointing, but in the end
they will be with us soon.  The background on this is that in 2007 the
HRC/Obama endorsement vote divided their board and that divide bled into
their internal AFSCME election for President.  It was not good and feelings
are still present around this.

Here are some points to consider:

1.  IF we want to press AFSCME to still go in September 21/22.  Their board
is still meeting.  I discussed this possibility with Brian and he didn't
think that Lee would get there but deferred to the conversation between JP
and Lee.  I offered that we could do some one on one reassurance calls with
squishy board members to help shore up support.  I mentioned to Brian what
we are doing this with NEA with individual calls.

2.  I flagged for Brian that some reporters have already inquired with us
about their September 21/22 meeting and that what we do NOT want to happen
is for Sanders people to do a victory lap that they won and successfully
delayed this.  I have asked Brian if we could tee up a few board members
proactively to go on record to say, look the meeting on September 21/22 was
already packed with business we want to do a separate meeting just on the
endorsement and that will happen on October X date.  Brian said he would
work with me on that and I am getting together with Jesse today.

3.  I don't want to take the October date for granted.  I asked Brian to
let me know if we can help with outreach on the board to shore this up.  We
would do that.  I have also already started to incorporate AFSCME leaders
into clutches in the field and will continue to offer that.  Let me know if
you have other thoughts on this.

4.  HRC is expecting this in September.  I will see her tomorrow for the
NEA teletown hall.  How do you want to share this?
