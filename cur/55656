Hi John - Great seeing you at Lee and Patrick's house.=C2=A0 I wanted to fl=
oat an idea by you as I get hit up on a near daily/weekly basis by current =
and former Foreign Service officers who want to know how they can support t=
he HRC campaign. These range from junior through ambassador level folks rea=
ching out to me. As you well know, there are strict rules regarding politic=
al activities by current FSO's, but playing within those boundaries they co=
uld be a powerful community of support.=C2=A0When the time is right they co=
uld first be convened by former-State types (like Nides or Jake Sullivan) o=
n an off-duty conference call for an information session. That way we could=
 gather a small army of these FSO's who can feel a part of the campaign and=
 be offered talking points, social media items, etc...for use in their pers=
onal off-duty capacities. This group could provide foreign policy surrogate=
s, signers of a mass endorsement, social media amplification, and push back=
 on issues when needed. This would be a highly capable group of enthusiasti=
c and tech savvy influencers who feel connected to HRC and want to be a par=
t of her campaign in some way -- many of them are actually ready and willin=
g to quit the Foreign Service to volunteer on the campaign.=C2=A0=C2=A0As y=
ou can tell, I=E2=80=99m looking to be helpful and useful in any way I can.=
 As I told Dan -- if it weren't for never seeing him or our kids again, I w=
ould really want to be your CoS!! =C2=A0Let me know your thoughts and maybe=
 it's is too early in the process....
