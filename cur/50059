If you want to save the Democratic Senate, well,
friend, it's go time.

The GOP and their corporate backers are outspending my
friend Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, and the race we MUST
win to save our Senate majority is tight.

Polling shows former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown is neck
and neck with Jeanne in her fight for re-election. The
latest CNN numbers call it a "dead heat" and RealClearPolitics
recently downgraded the race to a "Toss Up."

But there's good news: election projections from Nate
Silver and the New York Times say that Democrats have a
good chance of holding the Senate, and giving to Jeanne
Shaheen right now is the best way to make sure it happens.

There are less than five days until the election -- and YOU
can make all the difference between winning and losing right
now by giving to Jeanne and defending our Democratic Senate
majority.

Give now to join me in supporting New Hampshire's Senator
Jeanne Shaheen and save our Democratic Senate:

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/terry-for-jeanne

Jeanne is the only Democrat elected to the Senate from New
Hampshire in the last 30 years -- she knows how to win -- but
to compete on the air and on the ground, she needs our
support.

Here in Virginia, we've seen how much progress we can make
with the right people working together in office -- so we
have to understand the importance of holding our Democratic
Senate majority. Jeanne will fight for a strong
middle-class, equal pay for equal work, and affordable
quality education. Scott Brown will fight for big oil and
big corporations. How do we know? She's already done it --
and so has he.

Click here to give $5 or more to Senator Jeanne Shaheen and
defend our Democratic Senate majority!

country.
