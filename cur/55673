IMPORTANT FEC DEADLINE TONIGHT:=A0 We can win eight critical battleground S=
enate races, but we need your support right away. Please don't wait - give =
today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Dg7AZopZLlEznlTgXFkzXsA

John=A0--

Let me get right to the point. Our deadline to raise the funds needed to ex=
pand grassroots campaigns in battleground Senate races in Arizona, Connecti=
cut, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, Virginia, and Wisconsin is=
 MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.

With only a few hours until the midnight fundraising deadline, we're still =
$12,299 short of our goal. If we can get just a few hundred more supporters=
 to contribute, we would reach it. Tonight's FEC deadline is absolutely cri=
tical. Why? Because
tomorrow our campaign field team will start prioritizing races and resource=
s and -- to be frank - we don't want to leave a single winnable Senate race=
 behind.

We must make sure that all our Senate battleground races have the people an=
d volunteers needed to win on November 6th - and more resources means we ca=
n reach more voters.

We need YOUR help TODAY - will you contribute right now to help us reach ou=
r goal? We need 41 seats in the U.S. Senate to maintain a firewall to keep =
any extreme anti-environment legislation from becoming law. Please chip in =
with a donation today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DtC8qa9tbtOP78PG-Yn7=
-Hg .

We're flooding these battleground Senate races with canvassers, hard-hittin=
g ads, and hundreds of thousands of targeted mail pieces - all to make sure=
 voters know where candidates stand.=A0All these efforts are keeping enviro=
nmental issues front-and-center through Election Day and beyond.

But without your support right now, we risk losing clean energy champions l=
ike Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, Tim Kaine in Virginia, and Jon Teste=
r in Montana - to Big Oil's cronies.

We're poised to launch our most aggressive campaigns ever in these states -=
 but only if we can reach our goal of $120,000.

Our planet can't afford anything less. Please, don't wait for someone else =
to do it - please make your gift before midnight TONIGHT: http://action.lcv=
.org/site/R?i=3DX5p7tg-U83p3dGaqQEUSAQ .

Thanks for all you do.
