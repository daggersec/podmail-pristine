I just realized its you! For some reason your name was cut short on the ema=

It might also be useful to connect you with one of the political people on =
the campaign, since to my knowledge the Governor has not yet endorsed in th=

To that end, I&#39;m copying John Podesta, the chair of the Hillary for Ame=
