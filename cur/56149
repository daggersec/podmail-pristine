      Dear Friend,

   I'm back to talk to you about Colorado's air. And I'm going to start with
   West Virginia's water again.

   West Virginia is still reeling from the Freedom Industries coal-related
   chemical spill that left 300,000 without clean water for weeks. Many of =
my
   friends back home are still nervous to drink the water. And word came out
   yesterday that there was another significant coal-related spill in West
   Virginia (this one by a company called Patriot Coal... seriously, you
   can't make this stuff up). West Virginia's water is a mess. There are no
   regulations on the main industry--coal--in my old home state and the
   people there are suffering because of it.

   Worse, the people in West Virginia feel like they have no say in the
   matter. Just weeks after the spill that left 300,000 people without wate=
r,
   the West Virginia Senate's Natural Resources Committee met to address the
   water quality standards--and voted to weaken them. That's right. After o=
ne
   of the worst chemical spills into West Virginia's water supply in histor=
y,
   the folks who are elected to protect the water voted to WEAKEN the quali=
ty
   standards.

   What's happening in West Virginia is shameful.

   Which brings us back to Colorado. In Colorado, we have air pollution due
   to a key industry--oil and natural gas. This industry is good in that it
   creates Colorado jobs and helps our economy, but not if it turns our air
   toxic and unbreathable. That's why Colorado's Air Quality Control
   Commission (AQCC) has been working hard over the past year to draft stro=
ng
   rules that would regulate the oil and gas industry and protect the air we
   breathe as the oil and gas industry makes record profits in our state.

   Some forward-thinking companies support the rules, but they are under
   attack from others. There are companies that care more about their bottom
   lines than about the air we breathe. The multi-billion-dollar behemoths
   Exxon and Chevron, and other companies are doing their best to gut these
   rules. We need your help to make sure the Air Quality Control
   Commissioners stand strong and adopt these rules for all Coloradans.

   Air quality rules and the rulemaking process are pretty wonky stuff. I
   read up on this stuff on a daily basis and I still have a hard time
   keeping up. I know there are folks out there who care about protecting
   Colorado's air but just don't have the time to study up on the issue eve=
ry
   day.

   Which is why I thought I'd try and help you out. I put together a little
   video to help explain what's happening here in Colorado. The video is
   terrible. Maybe it's terrible in a "It's so bad it's good way" sort of
   way. Or maybe it's just terrible. Regardless, it helps make some sense of
   the importance of the air quality rules being decided here in Colorado.

                                    [1][IMG]

   [2]Take a second to watch the video.

   Now, there are couple of things you can do:

     * First, share this video around with your friends. Help spread the wo=
rd
       this is happening.
     * Second, go to [3]progressnowcolorado.org/air and get informed.
     * From there, email the AQCC to ask them to adopt strong rules. The
       hearing starts next Wednesday, February 19th. The more people they
       hear from who support strong rules, the better.

   Colorado isn't West Virginia. We aren't going to let the bad leaders in
   one industry run rampant through our state and pollute our beautiful and
   valuable natural resources. We can find a way to balance smart, sensible
   regulations with responsible leadership from the oil and gas industry to
   keep Colorado's economy running and keep our air clean.

   We can do all that.

   Thanks so much for your time,
   Jen Caltrider
