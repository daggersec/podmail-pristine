 McCain Co-Chair Calls Obama "A Guy Of The Street," Raises Drug
Use<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/09/mccain-co-chair-calls-oba_n_133369.html>

Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, a McCain campaign co-chairman, edged up
to an explicitly racial attack on Barack Obama on Thursday, describing the
Illinois Senator as a "guy of the street" before raising his youthful drug
use.

Appearing on Dennis Miller's radio show, Keating charged that the Democratic
nominee was covering up his "very extreme" record, and urged Obama to be
more honest with Americans. "He ought to admit," Keating said, "'You know,
I've got to be honest with you. I was a guy of the street. I was way to the
left. I used cocaine. I voted liberally, but I'm back at the center.'"

Keating began to address Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright -- a topic
that John McCain himself has said should be off-limits -- but Miller
interrupted him to return to the discussion of cocaine.

The criticism is the latest in a spate of increasingly aggressive attacks
from the McCain-Palin camp.

It's unclear what Keating meant by "a guy of the street," but his assertion
that Obama should "admit" his brief drug use in high school makes little
sense, since it was Obama himself who did disclose
it<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/02/AR2007010201359_pf.html>in
his memoir published 12 years ago.

Keating was one of McCain's earlier supporters,
endorsing<http://74.125.113.104/search?q=cache:41c3Aj1hU5IJ:www.johnmccain.com/actioncenter/print.aspx%3Fr%3Da509cad0-30bc-4673-af8d-fab9295ca0b9%26t%3Dceb20ad6-f634-43ef-aedd-f5b59c4e02d7+site:www.johnmccain.com+%22frank+keating%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us>the
Arizona Senator even before he officially launched his 2008
presidential
bid. Keating is a member of McCain's National Campaign Committee, and serves
as co-chair for various campaign groups, such as Catholics for McCain and
Sportsmen for McCain.

Here's the complete transcript from Miller's program today:

MILLER: It's the most liberal, let's just say that. We're talking to Frank
Keating, former Oklahoma Governor, John McCain supporter. Frank, let's just
say, it's the most liberal. The thing that bothers me the most about all
this with Barack Obama is not the -- I know he's the most liberal guy. You
know, I know he's gotten this close to the White House and I know most
people don't realize he's probably the most liberal senator we have. The
thing that bothers me the most is I recognize the obfuscation and the smoke
and mirrors as Clinton-esque. When I hear him reduce Ayers to "this is a guy
who lives in my neighborhood" or Rev. Wright, "I was there 500 times and
never saw him." The acts themselves don't bother me as he's starting to
treat me like an idiot too when he's blowing this smoke my way. He ought to
just come clean and say, "listen, I came up through Chicago, you make some
errors there." I'd almost be able to absolve it more easily then.

KEATING: Well, and that's what concerns me, Dennis, because when I was in
the State Senate and statehouse of my state, if someone had voted against
the entire state budget because it had too much money for corrections, all
of us would have, you know, strained our necks to find out who is this
because that would have been a very extreme position, basically saying to a
law enforcement officer as I was or my son was a state trooper, "you know,
you make an arrest, you risk your life, for nothing" because we're going to
make sure that person doesn't go to prison even though the laws of the state
require it. So, that puzzles me. Just he ought to admit, "you know, I've got
to be honest with you. I was a guy of the street. I was way to the left. I
used cocaine. I voted liberally, but I'm back at the center." I mean, I
understand the big picture of America. But he hasn't done that...

MILLER: He's copped to that...

KEATING: Jeremiah Wright is...

MILLER: Wait, I've got to jump in Frank. He has copped to the blow use,
right? I mean, he did so in his own book he said he did blow.

KEATING: Oh yes, he did.

MILLER: Well, I'm just saying that doesn't enter this to me.
