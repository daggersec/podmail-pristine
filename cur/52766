FYI below - CCI folks estimate the islands program (as
envisioned/discussed on Friday) would cost us $1 million or less, and
they believe UNDP would cover it.

This doesn=92t really answer our other question about what would happen
to the CCI staff currently working on =93clean energy=94. I=92m checking on
that.

I also can=92t tell the extent to which Ira has signed off on this, vs.
to what extent this is being driven by CCI staff (Darien) without
Ira=92s blessing.

Hi Ami,



As discussed, a few thoughts on a potential budget for an island
energy program. These are very preliminary estimates, while the exact
collaboration between the Clinton Foundation and UNDP is still being
defined. I would be very happy to discuss further.



Cheers,



Darien





A few notes:



The first phase of a Clinton Foundation/UNDP island program (or
competition) is expected to encompass three islands; one in the
Caribbean, one in the Pacific Rim and one in the Indian Ocean/Africa
region.

The bulk of the work will begin in June once the three initial islands
are selected.

For illustrative purposes, names are attached below of CCI staff with
significant expertise and longstanding private sector relationships in
the relevant area. The assumption is the program will require 25% of
their time, and they have all indicated a strong desire to participate
-- if it can be arranged with C40. If it is instead necessary to hire
new people, the salary component of the budget may increase as much as
2x.

The UNDP has indicated they are willing to cover Clinton Foundation
costs of this magnitude (e.g. $500K-1mn) via existing technical
assistance budgets. However, they have also indicated that they could
support a much larger scope, as well as sign off faster, if the
Clinton Foundation can contribute matching funds.
