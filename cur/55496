John --

I can tell you from working with General Douglass that our nation needs =
him in Congress. As my Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he helped us keep =
the Navy up to date and strong, turn deficits into surpluses and set up =
new job training programs. So I know he is ready to roll up his sleeves =
and get to work for the 5th District.

But we only have one week left to the election. In less than 24 hours, his =
campaign will make their final resource decisions to help turn his =
momentum into a win. That's where you come in.

John answered my call to serve all those years. Now I'm asking you to =
answer his call with a generous contribution before it's too late.

-- President Bill Clinton

P.S. I can't wait to see John Douglass in Congress, because of what I =
first saw in him -- a leader who cares too much about our fellow Americans =
not to take action. Show him your support in the next 24 hours.
Paid for by John Douglass for Congress
