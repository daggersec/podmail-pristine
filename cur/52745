The Coming Battle of the  Ritz Carlton=20

President Obama=92s announcement yesterday began the final chapter in the =
=20
14-month war over health care reform.  The decisive battle will obviously t=
ake=20
place on the floor of  Congress.  But the most symbolically  powerful=20
battle may take place next week some miles from the Capitol, at the  Ritz C=
arlton=20
Hotel on the edge of Washington=92s  tony Georgetown  neighborhood. =20
That=92s where executives from America=92s health care industry will gather=
=20
under  the banner of AHIP (America=92s Health Insurance Plans) to  plot =96=
 and=20
then execute =96 a last-ditch attempt to defeat health insurance  reform. =
=20
That=92s also where, on Tuesday, March 9th, thousands of  demonstrators fro=
m=20
Health Care for America Now (HCAN) and allied groups will  mass to confront=
=20
the insurance executives =96 and their attempts to effectively  deny qualit=
y=20
health care to millions of Americans. =20
The term =93battle=94 is entirely  appropriate.  The insurance  executives =
who=20
run America=92s health insurance companies  are, in fact, waging war on the=
=20
American public.  Their goal is the continued domination  of the American=
=20
health care system.  They want to be able to continue to raise their rates =
more=20
than three  times faster than wages =96 and twice as fast as the underlying=
=20
cost of health  care =96 so they can continue to gorge themselves with reco=
rd=20
profits. They want  to continue to siphon off the healthiest, wealthiest=20
customers and deny access  to insurance for anyone with a =93pre-existing c=
ondition
=94 or illness. =20
Just like all wars, their war on the American family costs tens of =20
thousands of lives and untold suffering.   Each year, the lack of health in=
surance =20
costs 45,000 lives.  In other words,  each year we lose 80% as many=20
Americas to insurance industry greed  as died in the entire Vietnam War.  =
=20
What=92s worse, these insurance executives don=92t get a first-hand look at=
 =20
the suffering and death that results from their policies, or their attempts=
=20
to  block reform.  They manage their war  from pristine office towers. They=
=20
don=92t have to look into the eyes of a husband  whose wife has just died o=
f=20
cancer that could have been cured if it were caught  early =96 but went=20
undetected because for financial reasons she had no insurance  and kept put=
ting off=20
a routine check up. =20
They don=92t have to face the family who lost their home -- and everything =
=20
else -- to bankruptcy because an uninsured medical emergency wiped out the =
=20
fruits of decades of hard work.=20
They don=92t have to explain themselves to the millions of Americas who =20
worry they are just one pink slip away from losing their insurance coverage=
 and =20
know that a spouse=92s history of cancer or heart disease or diabetes will=
=20
prevent  them from ever getting insurance again. =20
On next Tuesday, thousands of those Americans will demand to confront =20
those executives in the lovely halls and conference rooms of the Ritz. =20
Like the mythical mobster Tony Soprano, the kids of these insurance =20
executives think their parents have respectable jobs.  In fact, just like T=
ony=20
Soprano, they  traffic in lives and suffering in order to make more and mor=
e=20
money for  themselves. =20
Time to rip off the patina of respectability. =20
Take people like Ed Hanway, the former CIGNA CEO who retired at the end  of=
=20
last year with a $73 million golden parachute =96 money he earned by denyin=
g =20
coverage to people like Nataline Sarkisian.  Nataline died in 2007, just=20
before  Christmas.  She was 17.  She died because CIGNA wouldn=92t pay for =
=20
Nataline=92s liver transplant =96 even though she had health insurance.  =
=20
The average transplant operation and hospital stay costs about  $250,000. =
=20
Ed Hanway=92s $73 million  golden parachute would have bought 292 liver=20
transplants.  Nataline only needed  one.=20
Or people like Wellpoint=92s CEO Angela Braly =96 who last year took down =
=20
almost $10 million in compensation.  Wellpoint=92s Anthem Blue Cross divisi=
on=20
just announced a 39% premium  increase; it says it needs more money to meet=
 its=20
expenses =96 like Angela=92s $10  million salary.  And by the way,  Wellpoi=
nt=92
s profits for the fourth quarter of 2009 skyrocketed to $2.7 billion =96 =
=20
accomplished by actually providing health insurance to 185,000 fewer policy=
=20
holders. =20
Or people like AHIP chief lobbyist, Karen Ignagni, who once worked to =20
promote health care for average people at the AFL-CIO.  She took her thirty=
=20
pieces of silver and  switched sides. =20
These people are coming to Washington to use their enormous economic  power=
=20
to prevent their fellow Americans from having secure, affordable health =20
care. They cannot be allowed to succeed. =20
In fact, they should be greeted with the same enthusiasm with which we =20
would greet the forces of an invading army. They should be met at National=
=20
Airport and Union Station with signs  declaring they are unwelcome in the n=
ation=92
s capital.  =20
HCAN has sent letters asking the dozen speakers listed on their agenda to =
=20
cancel their appearances.  HCAN has  demanded that these academics and=20
consultants stop giving aid and comfort to the  enemy =96 stop giving them =
the=20
cover of respectability. =20
These insurance executives are  not here to negotiate.  They are not  here=
=20
to shape legislation.  They are  here to stop health care reform dead in it=
s=20
tracks.  They will not be =93convinced=94 to allow  health care reform to p=
ass=20
the Congress.  They must be defeated. =20
Robert Creamer is a long-time political organizer and  strategist, and=20
author of the recent book:  =93Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can Win,=
=94=20
available on _Amazon.com._=20
(http://www.amazon.com/Listen-Your-Mother-Straight-Progressives/dp/09795852=
