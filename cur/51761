Brent's opinionated but has been one of our strongest defenders.

Subject: John, here's my advice
To: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>


While I have been warning for some time about the dangers facing the Clinton
campaign, aggressively in privately, tactfully in columns, during this
latest stage
I have been publicly defending her with no-holds barred, and here is my
advice
based on the reaction I have been receiving and the dangers I see coming to
fruition.

I would recommend you assemble a short reading list of everything
surrounding
President Kennedy's full acceptance of responsibility after the Bay of Pigs,
beginning with the substance and tone of his unequivocal taking of
responsibility
and ending with his huge rise in the polls, to nearly 90% favorable
ratings, after
he did this.

And then I would suggest she plan the equivalent and take full, absolute and
unequivocal responsibility for making a mistake with the private emails and
give an
honest, direct, explanation of the reasons I believe she used those private
emails.

And this should not be done in a news conference with shouting reporters in
a
perp walk atmosphere, but in an indoor speech to her most loyal supporters
in a dignified setting or in a thoughtful taped interview with a respected
women's
advocate that would be shown as an introduction to a speech she would make
to a women-heavy group such as a meeting of Planned Parenthood or a less
controversial women's organization.

There is nothing wrong, and much right, with her saying that in her life
experience
she has seen the most hostile attacks and partisan investigations of her
husband,
the most successful and fondly remembered living former president, which
included
partisan attacks against her up to the level of her being accused of
murder.  All at
an era when American politics has reached a new low that justifiably
creates outrage
from large segments of the public.

She could say that she correctly anticipated that these attacks against her
would
continue and escalate if she ever ran for the presidency, witness the
shameful
abuse of congressional power with multiple GOP congressional committees
conducting four years of witch hunts to try to exploit the death of brave
Americans at Benghazi.

She could say she was right anticipating this, but wrong in overreacting by
trying
to shield her private emails, and she takes full responsibility for this,
and apologizes
to her supporters and everyone else, and now she has turned over all
information,
it will ultimately be seen that there no egregious wrongs committed.  Now
she vows to fight on for the people she cares about and the causes the
believes
in and for an America that deserves better than a Republican party whose
frontrunner
repeatedly insults women, defames Hispanics, intimidates other Republicans,
and
America deserves better than a politics that brings perpetual campaigns of
personal destruction funded by the most wealthy special interests taking
advantage
of some of the worst Supreme Court decisions since slavery that would give
the wealthiest the power to buy elections while undermining the right of
citizens to vote in them.

She needs to stop talking like a lawyer parsing legalistic words and a
potential
defendant expecting a future indictment, which is how she often looks and
sounds
to many voters today.  Instead, she should take full responsibility for a
mistake
with no equivocation, and segue into the role of a populist prosecutor
against a
corrupted politics that Americans already detest.....and make a direct
attack against
the Donald Trump politics of daily insults and defamations and intolerance
against
whichever individuals and groups he tries to bully on a given day, and
while defending
some Republican candidates against his attacks, she should deplore their
being
intimidated by his insults and offering pastel versions of the intolerance
he peddles.

In other words, she should stop acting like a front-runner who cautiously
tries to exploit the rules of a rigged game to her advantage, and start
acting like a fighting
underdog who will fight on behalf of Americans who want a higher standard
of living
for themselves, a higher standard of politics for the nation, and a higher
level of
economic opportunity and social justice for everyone.

Like JFK after the Bay of Pigs, the more responsibility she takes now the
more she
will succeed going forward.
