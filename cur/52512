Did you guys see this video they have released from her speaking about
outsourcing in India, in 2012?

Sorry if I missed this on an earlier email chain.

It is worth watching the video, where she says there are pluses and minuses
to outsourcing.

TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. =E2=80=93 Bernie Sanders on Friday said =E2=80=9Cdisas=
trous=E2=80=9D trade
deals backed by Hillary Clinton decimated Michigan manufacturing, threw
Michigan workers out of decent-paying jobs and are =E2=80=9Cone of the reas=
ons that
the middle class in the country is disappearing.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CIf the people of Michigan want to make a decision about which cand=
idate
stood with workers against corporate America and against these disastrous
trade agreements, that candidate is Bernie Sanders,=E2=80=9D he said to che=
ers from
2,125 supporters here at the Streeters Center.

Starting with the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement, Clinton
supported trade deals when she was secretary of state, a U.S. senator and
first lady.

Sanders joined picket lines to protest NAFTA and other trade deals =E2=80=
=9Ccrafted
by =E2=80=9Cthe big-money interests and corporations,=E2=80=9D Sanders said=
.

=E2=80=9CHillary Clinton was on the other side of many of these trade agree=
ments,=E2=80=9D
Sanders added.

Not only was Clinton on the wrong side of a series of business-backed trade
deals, she also has only grudgingly questioned the biggest trade deal of
all time. Until an election-eve conversion, she had backed the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal
which would be the biggest in history.

Meanwhile, Sanders=E2=80=99 campaign responded to Clinton=E2=80=99s asserti=
on in Detroit
that she has a plan to restore manufacturing jobs. =E2=80=9CThe American pe=
ople are
sick and tired of establishment politicians who promise to create
manufacturing jobs during campaign season but support trade policies that
make it easier to outsource these jobs the day after they get elected,=E2=
=80=9D
Sanders said in a prepared statement.

Meanwhile, Sanders=E2=80=99 campaign on Friday distributed a video showing =
Clinton
in India in 2012 discussing what she said were =E2=80=9Cpluses and minuses=
=E2=80=9D to
outsourcing U.S. jobs.
