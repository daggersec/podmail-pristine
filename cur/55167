John & Eryn,

All the best in the months ahead.  Please let me know if there's ever
anything I can do to help you or the cause.

For the next 18 months, I'm committed to working on realizing the goals of
the policies and P3s I helped to launch from the White House - to improve
our economic dynamism, investments in human capital, and good job
opportunities for all Americans. I'm working towards specific goals, but
have the flexibility to pitch in on high priority stuff you're working on.

Since leaving WH a few weeks ago, I've launched a non-profit venture called
Opportunity@Work, based at New America (19th and L).  As Step 1, we've
mobilized top tech innovators, 20+ cities and hundreds of employers (so
far) to do make the demand-side of the job market - the way employers hire,
train, and promote - more effective and inclusive.

It's promising so far, and fun.  Here's a Fortune "Work 3.0" column that
ran the week after O@W launched:

http://fortune.com/2015/03/19/job-search-future/

We're translating policy into action.  I believe the direct impact and
policy implications of this initiative are central to the challenge of
expanding employment opportunities, raising wages and job mobility, and
seeing more inclusive growth.

Let's stay in touch.  Thanks for all you're doing.

Take care,

Byron

P.S.  If you're interested, here's an early Opportunity@Work blurb (and
website):  http://www.opportunityatwork.org/

Based at New America in Washington DC, Opportunity@Work is a civic
enterprise whose mission is to re-wire the U.S. labor market to enable more
Americans to achieve upward mobility in the job market and workplace, to
facilitate actions by U.S. employers to develop the talent they
collectively need to succeed and grow, and to scale up innovations that
unlock more fully all people=E2=80=99s potential for higher-value, meaningf=
ul work
- as a source of economic opportunity and national competitive
advantage.   Launched
March 9 2015, Opportunity@Work's first initiative aims to enable widespread
adoption of inclusive hiring and accelerated training into good tech jobs,
across all industries.  Over half a million such jobs are open today, with
employer demand to hire for these jobs growing faster than traditional
education and training programs. Beginning with the 21 communities of the
President's =E2=80=9CTechHire=E2=80=9D initiative, who today have over 130,=
000 open IT
jobs,


Opportunity@Work will work with a range of technology, private sector and
philanthropic partners to create freely available tools to streamline the
sign-up and participation of thousands of employers (several hundred have
already signed on) in inclusive hiring, and to facilitate a nationwide
learning network to rapidly improve the TechHire initiative=E2=80=99s impac=
t.  We
are also working to develop a new =E2=80=9Cpay-it-forward=E2=80=9D financin=
g mechanism to
allow lower-income Americans to be trained and placed into good technology
jobs across the United States, beginning in TechHire communities.
