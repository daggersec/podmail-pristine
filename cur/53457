I assume you got slammed by the weather. I'm at Whitehaven,  but Mary is
picking me up at 6:00 so meeting probably doesn't work. If he is staying
over, I could come back tonight after the event or come over in the am. I
have a 10:00 tomorrow with the Singapore Foreign minister which I can
cancel. Otherwise free.
