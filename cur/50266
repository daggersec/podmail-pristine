*McCain Criticizes Remarks by Obama's Former Pastor (NY Times 4/28/08)*
By MICHAEL COOPER
Senator John McCain delved on Sunday into remarks made by Senator Barack
Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., saying it was
"beyond belief" that Mr. Wright had likened the Romans at the time of Jesus'
crucifixion to the Marines and had suggested that the United States was
acting like Al Qaeda under a different color flag.

*Candidates' Health-Care Ideas May Not Offer Immediate Cure (WSJ 4/28/08)*
By LAURA MECKLER
Sen. John McCain kicks off a week of health-care pegged events Monday with a
simple message: The fundamental problem facing the health-care system is
spiraling costs that must be brought under control. It is an idea that
Democrats and Republicans agree on.
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120934133175548483.html?mod=special_page_campaign2008_leftbox

*McCain focuses on lower costs on health-care tour (Reuters 4/28/08)*
By John Whitesides
MIAMI - Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Monday will argue
the way to improve U.S. health-care coverage lies in lowering costs and
increasing competition rather than the "big-government" schemes he says the
Democrats advocate. McCain, opening a week-long U.S. campaign swing to focus
on his health care proposals, will visit a Miami children's hospital on the
first stop on Monday.

*Ex-CEO Fiorina Seems Comfortable Following McCain's Lead (WSJ 4/28/08)*
By ELIZABETH HOLMES
These days, former H-P CEO Carly Fiorina frequently accompanies Sen. John
McCain on the campaign trail. She is most prominent when he addresses his
economic policies, and her name appears on the short list for vice
president.

*McCain Frequently Used Wife's Jet for Little Cost (NY Times 4/27/08)*
By BARRY MEIER and MARGOT WILLIAMS
Given Senator John McCain's signature stance on campaign finance reform, it
was not surprising that he backed legislation last year requiring
presidential candidates to pay the actual cost of flying on corporate jets.
The law, which requires campaigns to pay charter rates when using such jets
rather than cheaper first-class fares, was intended to reduce the influence
of lobbyists and create a level financial playing field.

*3 Candidates With 3 Financial Plans, but One Deficit (NY Times 4/27/08)*
By LARRY ROHTER and MICHAEL COOPER
The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates differ strikingly in
their approaches to taxes and spending, but their fiscal plans have at least
one thing in common: each could significantly swell the budget deficit and
increase the national debt by trillions of dollars, according to tax and
budget experts. ... Mr. McCain's plan would appear to result in the biggest
jump in the deficit, independent analyses based on Congressional Budget
Office figures suggest.

States would stay in Iraq, the Democratic National Committee has begun
broadcasting a new advertisement.

*When the Times Make the Man (NY Times 4/27/08)*
By SAM TANENHAUS
...The paradox of Mr. McCain is that while he is among the oldest
presidential candidates in history he remains in some ways the youthful
rebel of the 1950s. The question is whether he has at last found a cause.
http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/weekinreview/27tanenhaus.html

*McCain's Gamble (Huffington Post 4/27/08)*
By Michael Fauntroy

...John McCain ... is taking an unusual step in this regard for someone from
the Grand Old Party (GOP): he's touring mostly black, poverty-ridden
communities, such as last week's trip to the Lower Ninth Ward in New
Orleans, to speak out against poverty and other societal ills. These are the
kinds of communities that most Republicans couldn't find with a map and a
Sherpa, so his "It's Time for Action" tour is notable. While he should be
commended for trying to address these issues and reach out to black voters,
the reality is that he is fighting against two important factors: history
and his own Senate record.

*McCain's Economic Undertow (National Journal 4/26/08)*
by Ronald Brownstein
With an assist from the unending Democratic nomination race, John McCain has
levitated above his party this spring. But antithetical answers that McCain
offered on the economy just one day apart this month crystallized the
challenge he will face in staying aloft as President Bush's support plummets
to uncharted depths.

*McCain backer's new view on God's wrath (Chicago Tribune blog 4/26/08)*
By Don Frederick
Pastor John Hagee has revised his view of God's wrath, and chances are John
McCain couldn't be happier. Without fanfare, in an e-mail sent the latter
part of Friday, Hagee backed off his assertion that Hurricane Katrina was
the Almighty's punishment of New Orleans because it had planned to host a
gay pride parade.

an African-American participant at a town-hall-style meeting at Xavier
University told Senator John McCain of Arizona here on Thursday.

*As Sadr Threatens Full-Scale War, McCain Says He Is 'Rather Pleased'
(ThinkProgress 4/25/08)*
The AP reports today that as a result of Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki's
recent offensive against Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's militia,
Sadr may "set aside his political ambitions" and restart "a full-scale fight
against U.S.-led forces." The violence would likely show "potentially
disastrous security implications" across the country.

*McCain: "Clear Who Hamas Wants to be the Next President" (Weekly Standard
blog 4/25/08)*
McCain spoke with bloggers this morning on a number of issues ranging from
William Ayers to Rev. Wright to Tony Rezko. Jennifer Rubin noted that Hamas
had endorsed Senator Obama and asked McCain whether Obama might have given
"an unhelpful signal" to the terrorist group. McCain's response: "All I can
tell you Jennifer is that I think it's very clear who Hamas wants to be the
next president of the United States...."

Republican presidential candidate John McCain got a deal when his campaign
rented gathering space from the city of Homewood for a private fundraiser
earlier this week. His campaign was given a discount of about 80 percent off
the standard booking rate for Rosewood Hall. ...The campaign also was given
free labor from Homewood City Jail inmates to set up tables and chairs for
the event, avoiding a $100 set-up fee, but did pay a standard $50 cleaning
fee.

*How McCain Lost in Pennsylvania (NY Times 4/27/08)*

*McCain's failure to cash in (Washington Times 4/27/08)*
When he effectively wrapped up the Republican nomination on Tsunami Feb. 5,
John McCain completed one of the greatest comebacks in American political
history. Unfortunately, while spending much of the subsequent 12 weeks
taking well-deserved victory laps, Mr. McCain has also apparently taken a
worrisome vacation from fund-raising.

*What Petraeus Would Face in Afghanistan (Washington Post 4/27/08)*
By David Ignatius
For many Americans who are weary of Iraq, Afghanistan is the "good war"
where the U.S. and its European allies are destroying what's left of al-
Qaeda and the Taliban. That view certainly holds with the Democratic
presidential candidates, who talk of adding more troops in Afghanistan next
year even as they pull troops out of Iraq.

The Geneva Conventions' ban on "outrages against personal dignity" does not
