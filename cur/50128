John,
We are starting to flush out our political engagement plan, which I would l=
ove to walk through with you and obtain your feedback in the next couple of=
 weeks.=C2=A0
One timely question for you is your opinion on whether we need a full time =
staff person for the campaign in Arkansas. The plan is to have a political =
staffer in NY and in DC as we move forward. Robby and I discussed whether t=
here is a need for one in Arkansas and wanted your advice. This person woul=
d be responsible for proactive engagement, continually updating our key peo=
ple and constiuencies on the different phases of the campaign.=C2=A0
Happy to talk through further or answer any questions. Wanted to get a gut =
check on if you thought this was a necessity. Robby, anything to add?
Thank you!
Marlon=C2=A0
