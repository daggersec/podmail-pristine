Dear John -=20

Moments ago, by a vote of 58 to 41, the U.S. Senate confirmed Chuck Hagel =
as our country's next Secretary of Defense.

Few understand the sacrifices made by our troops and military families =
better than Secretary Hagel.

He'll be the first enlisted man to serve in the position, was awarded two =
Purple Hearts (his brother earned three), and made a career of advocating =
for veterans in the U.S. Senate.

That's why VoteVets drove tens of thousands of petitions, letters and =
calls into the Senate during the confirmation process.

Share your thoughts, priorities and well-wishes for Secretary Hagel, and =
we'll deliver them to the Defense Department next week.

http://action.votevets.org/hagel

You should be proud of our collective effort in this fight -- the voice of =
veterans and military families made a real difference in overcoming the =
first ever filibuster of a Secretary of Defense nominee.

And while a number of Republicans put patriotism over party today, it was =
sad to see once proud moderates like Lindsey Graham cower in fear of a =
potential primary campaign.

But overcoming the right-wing smears ensures Chuck Hagel emerges from this =
process stronger than he entered -- fully vetted, battle-tested and ready =
to lead on day one.

I hope you'll share your thoughts and priorities for Secretary Hagel at =
the link below -- it's an opportunity to have your voice heard by the =
incoming leadership at the Department of Defense.
