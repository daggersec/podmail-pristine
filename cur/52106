I'm glad you got to ride on the big plane. That was my goodbye gift. It all s=
eemed to go well and I'm glad my home town finally has a National Park. Loca=
l Hawaii press looked great. Colorado seemed fine save for the pissy Congres=
sman. Lots more to do and I'm glad you are there to make up big difference. =
 Don't hesitate to call.
