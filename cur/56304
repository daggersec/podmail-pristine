Thanks for standing with us and I hope you have a terrific 2011.

League of Conservation Voters


Dear John,

Please accept my sincere thanks for your support this year. Although 2010 w=
as a difficult year, we accomplished some of our key legislative and electo=
ral goals with your help. As 2010 comes to a close, I want to say "thank yo=
u" again for your tremendous support and let you know what we'll be working=
 on next year.

With your help this year, we were able to achieve several significant envir=
onmental victories. We defeated the Murkowski resolution to gut the Clean A=
ir Act by six votes in the Senate. On Election Day, we defended
several critical allies and defeated seven of LCV's Dirty Dozen members -
including California's Prop 23, which would have suspended the state's land=
mark climate legislation. We worked closely with state partners to defeat
six members of the first-ever state level Dirty Dozen. We truly could not h=
ave
achieved these wins without your support.

It's no secret that the 112th Congress will be an adverse environment for o=
ur agenda. The Senate will be closely divided and the House will be control=
led by climate deniers like Rep. John Boehner, who has an abysmal LCV lifet=
ime score of 2% and recently stated, "...the idea that carbon dioxide is a =
carcinogen that is harmful to our environment is almost comical. Every time=
 we exhale, we exhale carbon dioxide. Every cow in the world, you know, whe=
n they do what they do, you've got more carbon dioxide." So we're not kiddi=
ng ourselves: We have a tough fight ahead. That being said, we know we have
the opportunity for critical environmental gains with the Administration an=
d
prevent major setbacks in Congress.=20

While we don't expect to see comprehensive climate legislation in Congress,=
 LCV will work with the Obama administration to ensure it uses its authorit=
y to take meaningful action to limit global warming pollutants and build a =
clean energy economy.=A0Additionally, LCV will mount a vigorous campaign to=
 defend against congressional efforts to gut the Clean Air Act and prevent =
the EPA from holding corporate polluters accountable.

LCV will also work to strategically identify opportunities to reduce global=
 warming pollution and make progress on clean energy policies in key states=
 whose governors or legislatures are friendly to the environment. After the=
 defeat of California's Prop 23 in November, LCV plans to build on this suc=
cess to strengthen state emissions reduction legislation.

A major campaign for LCV will be to hold the media accountable for distorti=
ng the truth about climate science. There's no doubt that Glenn Beck, Rush =
Limbaugh, Sarah Palin and others will continue their assault on the sound a=
nd settled science of climate change. When they attempt to confuse and misl=
ead the public about the dangers of carbon pollution and our dependence on =
oil, LCV will respond aggressively - mobilizing activists to respond to the=
ir lies and fight for the truth.

LCV will use several strategies to encourage pro-environment policies, hold=
 the media accountable, and defeat these threats:

*  Mobilize environmental activists to contact their elected officials via =
phone, e-mail and in-person prior to key votes
*  Publish the National Environmental Scorecard, the most respected yardsti=
ck for measuring political leaders' environmental records and holding them =
accountable=20
*  Utilize new online organizing tactics, including various social media to=
ols, to recruit and engage a new generation of clean energy advocates and a=
mbassadors
*  Educate voters about the benefits of creating a clean energy economy to =
build pressure for progress in the states, and from there to the national l=
evel
*  Coordinate with our state LCV partners and other key allies to build a
broad and diverse network of supporters in key states

We know that these strategies work, but they take significant resources to =
execute. We have our work cut out for us in 2011 and we cannot do it alone.=
 Will you please consider making an end-of-year contribution today that wil=
l
allow us to hit the ground running in 2011?

Thank you for your continued support of LCV's work.

Sincerely,
