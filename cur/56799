That's a relief to hear that you don't think it's moving.  If that's the ca=
se, I completely agree she should keep her powder dry.
On the quote--and I agree she should have one ready for the event--I would =
maybe be more specific along the lines of "there have to be clear groundrul=
es in these agreements that other countries must abide by the same labor st=
andards and environmental protections that we do here so our middle class c=
ompetes on a fair playing field overseas.  I'm certain Americans can out co=
mpete anyone, but everyone needs to play by the same rules".  Others can sa=
y that better than me.
