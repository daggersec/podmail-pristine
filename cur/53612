Hi Collin.  Thanks for talking.  Below is the context you asked for.  The o=
rder is up to you.

1. Regional tension.  On May 2, China dragged a giant oil rig into conteste=
d waters in the South China Sea, off the coast of Vietnam.  Vietnam has vig=
orously protested.  This is the most tense the South China Sea has been for=
 years, and the situation is not getting better.  Yesterday, a Vietnamese b=
oat sank after a scuffle with Chinese ships.  This is a potentially explosi=
ve standoff.   ASEAN is in negotiations with China over a Code of Conduct f=
or the South China Sea, which is clearly needed.  Our ally, the Philippines=
, is also involved in active territorial disputes with China. There are rea=
l US interests at stake here, above all in peace and stability in an incred=
ibly important region.  Half of all the world's ship bound goods pass throu=
gh the South China Sea.  There are important conversations the US Mission t=
o ASEAN needs to be having, right now, about ASEANs critical role in calmin=
g these tensions.

2. Kids.  Nina has two children, 7 and 11. They have never before lived ove=
rseas, or moved anywhere, and have only ever attended one, small school.  T=
his will be a major transition for them, and it will be tremendously helpfu=
l if they can start school with their classmates when the school year begin=
s on August 15.

3. USG travel.  Sec Kerry is to attend an ASEAN meeting in Burma (ARF) in t=
he first week of August.  ASEAN is a central part of the rebalance, a legac=
y issue for POTUS.  For Nina to do her job well, she needs to be at that me=
eting this year, not wait until next.  POTUS is also scheduled to travel to=
 an ASEAN meeting (the East Asia Summit) in November.  To make that meeting=
 as successful as it can be, Nina needs to be at the prior meeting in early=
 August.

4. US Mission to ASEAN.  This is a new mission, because POTUS decided to cr=
eate the Ambassadorship in 2010.  It cannot be good for morale to have no A=
mbassador for such an extended period of time.  The first dedicated Ambassa=
dor left at the end of 2013, nearly 6 months ago.

Thanks.  PLEASE let me know if you need more on any of these points.

Best,
Nina
