<p class=3D"MsoNormal">When I was in Liberia there was 2 of us working for t=
he Clinton Foundation. &nbsp;I was at JFK Hospital and she was at Redemption=
 Hospital (near West Point). &nbsp;We worked closely with the President and t=
he Ministry of Health and had a good working
 relationship. &nbsp;It is hard to describe but the name of the Clinton Foun=
dation is magic in Liberia-the local people are captivated by him and the Fo=
undation was embraced while we were there. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">We were discussing the situation in Liberia and are t=
hinking along the lines of a proposal that would help restore confidence in t=
he government if it partnered in some format with the Foundation as the popu=
lation has confidence in the Clinton
 Foundation. We would propose a working relationship with the government and=
 not a take over as we are aware the local healthcare staff should shoulder t=
he burden and would if given the appropriate support. &nbsp;We think with th=
e Clinton Foundation lending its
 name to this project we could recruit as large a staff as needed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The proposal includes the following:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">1-30 day rotation of western healthcare providers to t=
rain local healthcare providers/staff (we did this when I was there before) a=
nd provide treatment</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">2-committment of continuous medical supplies by ?WHO,=
 CDC, US gov</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">3-committment of food for the affected population-tho=
se with EVD or quarantined</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">4-autonomous authority but working with the governmen=
t/Ministry of Health</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The key to this is obtaining the endorsement of the C=
linton Foundation-we are exploring our contacts there-do you have any contac=
ts with the Foundaton?</p>
</div>
<div>
