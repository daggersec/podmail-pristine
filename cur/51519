Voila.  But sounds like Jen has more edits.

Hello. I'm sure you are hearing a lot about my emails when I was Secretary
of State.  So I want to take some time to try and explain what's going on
to you directly, in one place, at one time, as best as I can.

In 2007, when I was a U.S. Senator, I got my first Blackberry. I used it to
keep up with the news, with friends & family - like anyone else.

When President Obama asked me to serve as Secretary of State, =E2=80=8E it =
seemed
simpler to have just one email address. After all, my predecessors at State
had not relied on Department email.  In hindsight, though, this has proven
anything but simple.  There's a difference between what we are allowed to
do and what's smart to do. I shouldn't have used separate personal and
government accounts. I should have set a standard that others=E2=80=8E were
expected to meet. To do it all again, I would have used two email
addresses.

But I can't do it all again. I can only tell you it was a mistake, regret
it, explain it, and help the State Department and others fix any challenges
it caused.

That's what I did. Now I want to explain what I didn't do.

I didn=E2=80=99t keep my email secret. Whenever I emailed, it was from my a=
ddress.
Whenever people emailed me, it was to =E2=80=8Emy account. Work, personal,
whatever.

I also didn't do this to skirt rules.  And I didn=E2=80=99t do it to avoid =
having
my records preserved.  When the State Department asked former Secretaries
of State who served since email was widely used to help fill out the
archival record, I did so, printing 55,000 pages of email including
anything related to my work at the State Department. To get a sense of how
outdated some of the government=E2=80=99s archiving practices are, we had t=
o print
all 55,000 pages because that's what the rules demand. Believe me, printing
more than 30,000 email instead of handing them over electronically isn't
something anyone does by choice.

That's 30,000 more emails than every other former Secretary produced
combined.  No one else has produced their emails so far. I'm the only one.

And yes, there were 30,000 more messages that were completely personal and
had nothing to do with official business.

I do believe transparency in government is important. And by this point,
there isn't much you don't know about me. My finances are out there. My
medical history is out there. You know how much I've made, where I've gone,
what I'm allergic to.

Now I want to address the most serious aspect.

When it came to classified information, I certainly never used my
Blackberry.  And that had nothing to do with using a personal email
address. If I had been hillaryclinton@state.gov I could not have used it
for classified information either. At the State Department, mobile devices
aren't used to communicate secrets.  Almost everything of a classified
nature was presented to me via paper or in person. When I traveled,
elaborate steps were taken. =E2=80=8ESecure phones were set up, secure tent=
s were
constructed. I took my responsibilities in safeguarding our nation's
secrets seriously. So did my team did. Everyone at the State Department did
.

=E2=80=8EThis process of looking backwards to see if something should have =
been
classified at the time is fine. I don't want anything released to the
public that puts us at risk. And we=E2=80=99re all learning that different =
agencies
have very different views and procedures about what should be classified
and what shouldn=E2=80=99t.

As Secretary I was proud of what we accomplished. I was proud of the
thousands of people who've dedicated themselves to public service=E2=80=8E =
-
including those who came into State with me and left with me. I was proud
of them then, I'm proud of them now.

After nearly a year of offering to come to testify to Congress at any time
and anyplace, in October I'll be on Capitol Hill before the committee
looking at the tragic events of September 2012 in Benghazi, Libya. They
wanted to talk to me behind closed doors, but I insisted on all of you
being able to see what I was asked and how I answered.

I'm sure this issue will come up. It's unclear to me how it will help us
understand what happened in Benghazi or how to help prevent future
tragedies - but I'm going to do my best to answer whatever they ask.

And while I can't predict the future, let me finish by taking a stab:

=E2=80=8E=E2=80=A2 There will be many more emails to pour through.

=E2=80=A2 Some will be serious, some will be personal or mundane.

=E2=80=8E=E2=80=A2 You know I'm not great with a fax, but you're also going=
 to learn my
secret salad dressing recipe and who sent me LinkedIn requests. (And whose
I didn't accept!)

But when the State Department finishes releasing all my emails, you will be
able to see them all and judge for yourself.

Which is how it's supposed to work.

If you've made it this far, thank you for watching. And please spread the
word to your friends and family.

Shorter script that's still similar enough that she'll recognize it:

Hello. I thought you might find it useful to have some answers to share
with your friends if they ask about all these news stories out there about
my email habits when I was Secretary of State.  So I want to take some time
to try and explain it to you directly, in one place, at one time, as best
as I can.



Please bear with me because parts are confusing, and like many of you, I
don't understand all of the technological aspects.  [But when you hear all
the facts, I think you=E2=80=99ll agree that all the political noise over t=
his
issue is just that =E2=80=93 political noise.]



In 2007, when I was a U.S. Senator, I got my first Blackberry. I used it to
keep up with the news, with friends & family - and yes, I also got my fair
share of unsolicited forwards that sometimes made me laugh and sometimes
made me want to throw it away.  In short, I used email like most people.



Fast forward to 2009.  One of my husband's staff members bought the domain
name clintonemail.com so his team could switch from the various email
providers they were relying on to one consolidated system.  I joined them.



This was all before I started my new job as Secretary of State. Had
President Obama not asked me to join his team, if I had stayed in the U.S.
Senate, I still would have switched to this new email.



And when I did get to State, =E2=80=8E it seemed simpler to have just the o=
ne
address. After all, my predecessors at State had not relied on Department
email.  In hindsight, though, this has proven anything but simple.



That's the explanation - but it's no excuse. There's a difference between
allowed to do and smart to do. I shouldn't have done it this way. I should
have set the standard that others=E2=80=8E were expected to meet. To do it =
all

.



I also didn't do this to skirt rules.  And I didn=E2=80=99t do it to avoid =

served in the era of electronic communications to help fill out the

there isn't much you don't know about me. My finances are out there. My
medical history is out there. You know how much I've made, where I've gone,
what I'm allergic to.



But what wasn't work wasn't the government's business. =E2=80=8ESo I didn't=
 keep
those emails.  I didn't print them. I knew no matter what I decided to do
with them, I was in for criticism. So I chose to keep a modicum of privacy.
I hope you can understand that.



Now I want to address the most serious aspect.



When it came to classified information, I certainly never used my
Blackberry.  And that had nothing to do with using a personal email
address. If I had been hillaryclinton@state.gov I could not have used it
for classified information either. At the State Department, mobile devices
aren't used to communicate secrets.  Almost everything of a classified
nature was presented to me via paper or in person. When I traveled,
elaborate steps were taken. =E2=80=8ESecure phones were set up, secure tent=
s were
constructed. More than once when a tent was set up in some far-away hotel,
I was told to read the classified material with the blanket over my head.
No, that's not a joke. I took my responsibilities in safeguarding our
nation's secrets seriously. So did my team did. Everyone at the State
Department did .



=E2=80=8EThis process of looking backwards to see if something should have =
been
classified at the time is fine. I don't want anything released to the
public that puts us at risk. And we=E2=80=99re all learning that different =
agencies
have very different views and procedures about what should be classified
and what shouldn=E2=80=99t. What's not fine is to criticize people =E2=80=
=93 especially
career officials who have devoted their lives to serving our country -- for
handling what they didn't know might be deemed classified years later by
another part of the government. That's an impossible standard to meet.
Members of Congress and their staff also handled some of these messages.
Some articles being written about this issue today contain classified
information. Should someone sending that article to a colleague be told in
2020 that they broke the rules? I hope not.



As for the security of my email, =E2=80=8Ein more than a little bit of iron=
y, every
day we learn of a new hack by the Chinese, by the Russians. That millions
of Americans' personal information has been stolen.



As Secretary I was proud of what we accomplished. I was proud of the
thousands of people who've dedicated themselves to public service=E2=80=8E =
-
including those who came into State with me and left with me. I was proud
of them then, I'm proud of them now.



I wish that a video was enough to address this. I know it isn't though. But
I wanted to try to put everything in one place.



Along those lines, after nearly a year of offering to come up at any time
anyplace, in October I'll be on Capitol Hill before the committee looking
at the tragic events of September 2012 in Benghazi, Libya. They wanted to
talk to me behind closed doors, but I insisted on all of you being able to

=E2=80=8E=E2=80=A2 There will be many more email to pour through.

=E2=80=A2 Some will be serious, some will be embarrassing.

=E2=80=8E=E2=80=A2 You know I'm not great with a fax, but you're also going=
 to learn my
secret salad dressing recipe and who sent me LinkedIn requests. (And whose
I didn't accept!)

=E2=80=A2 There will be more dramatic leaks and assertions that prove to be=
 untrue.



But at some point, you're going to have them all. And if you suffer through
all 55,000 pages, you'll be able to judge for yourself.



Which is how it's supposed to work.
