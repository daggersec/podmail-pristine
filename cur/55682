term
it will hear the case of <i>Friedrichs v. California
Teachers Association</i>, which calls into question the right of public sec=
tor
to collect a =E2=80=9Cfair share=E2=80=9D fee when it bargains for non-unio=
n members.=C2=A0 These fees ensure that our public sector
unions can continue their fight for fair wages and benefits that teachers,
nurses, child care workers, EMTs, and so many others deserve who serve our
children and our communities day in and day out.=C2=A0 These workers deserv=
e to be part of the
strong middle class in America and their unions help to make it so.=C2=A0 I=
 will be watching this case closely and will
be standing firmly united behind our unions in their fight for their right =
to
bargain collectively for the higher wages that reflect the value of their w=
ork.</span><span style=3D"font-size:14pt;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#=
