John --

There are only 190 days until the 2010 election.

Many of you have been at work long before now. You've held strategy =
sessions all across the country to discuss how to most effectively help =
candidates in your community who are fighting to bring about change.

At OFA headquarters, we've been poring over your ideas, your input, and =
the best data we can get our hands on to determine the most helpful role =
we can play.

Together, based on that feedback, we've crafted a comprehensive electoral =
plan that can make a big difference in the upcoming elections.

President Obama recorded a video message to share our goals for 2010 with =
you -- and to remind us what's at stake. Watch it now:

http://2010.barackobama.com

We've accomplished a lot together. But we're in for a tough fight this =
fall.

Historical trends aren't in our favor -- the president's party generally =
loses seats in the first midterm election. And even though President Obama =
has taken bold steps like the Recovery Act to put us back on the path to =
prosperity, escaping from a financial crisis like this one takes time.

The prognosticators and pundits are predicting steep losses for the =
Democrats. The Republicans are already measuring the drapes for their new =
offices, saying that anything short of an electoral landslide that gives =
them back control of Congress won't be a victory.

But these are the same folks who said Barack Obama could never become =
president, the same ones who said we were trying to do too much, too fast =
-- and that we'd never pass historic health reform. They were wrong then, =
and they're wrong now.

I believe we can avoid the nightmare electoral scenario that Republicans =
in Washington have already convinced themselves will happen. But only if =
we work together.

Two years ago, we challenged a group of young and disaffected voters to =
participate in the 2008 election. They cast votes for the very first time =
and helped us elect a new president. You told us that your top priority =
for 2010 was to help these people head back to the polls -- and we built =
our plan around that goal.

President Obama has America heading in the right direction. But our =
opponents want to repeal health reform. They're standing with Wall Street =
banks to block any efforts to rein in reckless behavior and protect =
consumers. And they're attacking a foreign policy that has renewed =
America's standing in the world. They are eager to undo all we've done.

The stakes are high. And that's the level of commitment we need from you. =
So watch the President introduce our 2010 plan -- and find out how you can =
get involved in the fight:

It's a pleasure to continue our work together,

David Plouffe
