*RETIREES WARN MCCAIN HEALTH PLAN WOULD SLASH MEDICARE*

*The following statement was issued today by Edward F. Coyle, Executive
Director of the Alliance for Retired Americans, in response to a report in
today's Wall Street Journal that Senator John McCain's health care proposal
would result in cuts of $1.3 trillion over 10 years to Medicare and
Medicaid.*

"These reports pull back the curtain on the McCain health care plan, showin=
g
us that the real straight talk is how yet another big gift to the insurance
industry would be paid for on the back of millions of retirees.  This is
terrible news for our nation's seniors, who in this time of economic
anxiety, are already struggling to make ends meet as the prices of food,
energy, and transportation continue to soar.

"Medicare, like Social Security, is one of our nation's greatest success
stories.  Generations of seniors have been able to better afford their
doctor visits and prescriptions drugs.  Medicare works, and as part of
national health care reform, we need to strengthen Medicare =96 not decimat=
e
it.  As the McCain health care plan would also cause many employers to drop
retiree health care, a stronger Medicare program would be needed more than
ever.

"Today's news is the dirty little secret John McCain and his team of
lobbyists didn't want us to know about.  The Alliance for Retired Americans
will spend the next four weeks spreading the truth to older Americans about
what Senator McCain is proposing."
