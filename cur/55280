Dear Trustees,

I'm writing to report on the meeting of the Executive Committee, which was =
held on Friday, November 13.

We began the meeting with two facilities/finance matters.  The planned disc=
ussion on the draft proposal of a process for board approval of building pr=
ojects was deferred until a later meeting to give the chairs of the Committ=
ee on Facilities and Infrastructure and the Committee on Finance a chance t=
o discuss the proposal with Keith in greater detail, and then to bring it t=
o their committees for discussion.  We then turned our attention to the res=
olution to move forward with securing funding for planning and design of th=
e renovation of the Science and Math Center, which the committee approved.

Next, Teresa updated the committee on recent developments on campus, commen=
ting that applications are running at about the same level as last year (wh=
ich were 20% higher than the year before); the Knox Fund is running ahead o=
f last year and two major fundraising initiatives (K Club and crowdsourcing=
) are moving faster than expected; and finalists for the position of Vice P=
resident for Student Development are making campus visits.  She concluded h=
er report by remarking that the campus is calm-in contrast to many other ca=
mpuses around the country-and students and faculty are focused on end-of-th=
e term activities.

The chairs of the standing committees then highlighted key developments fro=
m their October meetings.  Next, we considered a draft proposal to add stud=
ents and faculty members to the standing committees of the board.  This pro=
posal had received support from the Committee on Trustees in October.  The =
Executive Committee also endorsed it.  There remain details to be worked ou=
t before we bring the proposal forward to the Committee on Trustees and the=
 full board for approval in February, however, the Executive Committee endo=
rsed my moving forward to discuss the proposal with the faculty on FASCOM. =
 I will also begin to discuss the idea with the Student Senate.

Before concluding the meeting, the committee encouraged Teresa to avail her=
self of the advice of trustees as she reaches the final stages in the searc=
h for the Vice President for Development.  She appreciated the offer and pl=
ans to contact those trustees she thinks can help her as she evaluates the =
three finalists.

In the next few weeks, Laurel will let you know when the minutes have been =
posted on the trustee website.  If you have any questions about the meeting=
, please let me know.

Best,

Richard
