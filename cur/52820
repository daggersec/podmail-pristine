Do we have a "surrogate" group in mind that could own the economic populist
"war on the middle class" message?


If not, do people have ideas for one?


It strikes me that Huckabee and Edwards have tapped into a message that is
really resonating in our focus groups "Bush and Republicans left us behind."
We should not let Lou Dobbs own the "war on the middle class" movement
message. Bush/McConnell and Republicans have been very successful at
maintaining pro-industry tax incentives and loopholes which make very good
framing moments.  It seems as though we could help direct some of this
populist, anti-washington, anti-big oil/big drug company energy into some
new narratives.

Maybe we could identify/create a* progressive "economic populist operation"
*which could do the following to create progressive framing around these
kitchen table hooks (gas prices, corporate loopholes, bush tax plan) with:**

*
*

-REPORTS. Regular reports breaking down the economic issues into stories (I
know CAP has been doing some of this.  (Examples: report on more spent on
schools and roads in Iraq than the U.S. this year, cost of holiday travel
with gas prices report - "holiday travel tax")

-ADS. Just this week Bush defeated Congress in extending a loophole tax
break for oil companies (even with oil at $90/barrel).  There is a great
branding moment here for Bush who said a year ago that 'with oil $55 dollars
a barrel we don't need tax incentives for oil companies.'

-SPOKESPEOPLE.  We some good plain spoken talkers who can articulate this
message on TV.

*This group would eventually take on the nominee as anti-middle class
(Romney's outsourcing, Huck's "corporations shouldn't pay taxes", or Rudy's
unequivocal endorsement of Bush tax cuts for billionaires).*
