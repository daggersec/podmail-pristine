John --

I'll tell you one thing that worries me about this election: There's a =
small group of billionaires and corporate special interests that are =
trying to buy their way back into power. They're spending their fortunes =
to defeat our folks and elect some of the most right-wing Republicans this =
country has ever seen.

We've launched the By the People Fund to fight back, with the goal of =
reaching 3 million grassroots donations to power the most ambitious =
on-the-ground effort ever waged in an election like this.

Here's the deal: We're only 22,981 donations away from shattering that =
goal right now. We could reach it this month, with one big push this week.

It's going to take 234 grassroots donations in Washington to get there.

Please chip in $5 to the By the People Fund today -- and help us take back =
our elections:

https://donate.barackobama.com/3Million9

I spent 36 years in the Senate, serving alongside Republicans of all =
stripes. But some of the Republicans running now are not from your =
grandfather's Republican Party. They're from the Republican Tea Party:

  -- Sharron Angle, who wants to be the next senator from Nevada, has =
called for phasing out Social Security and Medicare -- and even wants to =
end maternity coverage.

  -- Pat Toomey is running for Senate in Pennsylvania. He wants to =
de-regulate Big Oil and open up the Great Lakes for drilling.

  -- Christine O'Donnell, who is vying for the same Senate seat I was =
honored to hold in Delaware, is campaigning on repealing health reform.

The fact is this: The corporate special interests trying to elect these =
Republicans don't care if they're supporting extremists.

They just want us out of the way. With your help, we've enacted historic =
reforms despite their best efforts to derail us. Now, they're focused on =
one thing -- creating a Congress in which they can call the shots once =
again.

That's why they're pulling out all the stops -- and spending millions -- =
to win in November.

But we will not stand by and let them take the country backward.

We're counting on you to chip in today to fight back. Your donation will =
help us fund the organizing going on right now in key races across the =
country.

Please donate $5 or more and help us reach our By the People Fund goal:

https://donate.barackobama.com/3Million9

Thank you,

Joe Biden

P.S. -- Tomorrow night at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time, President Obama will be =
rallying with supporters in Madison, Wisconsin. It should be an exciting =
event -- and you can watch it live at www.BarackObama.com.
