I think this is good and where I come out for the reasons previously discus=
sed.

The fact that they could move to July is a bit of a wrinkle that had not go=
ne into my calculation earlier.  How likely is that?

I still  come down for July: money, reframing our candidate, field consider=
ations, a chance to =91freshen=92 things up and energize.  But it may be a =
little less urgent if our conventions are 4 weeks apart, v 8.

Subject: Draft convention memo to HRC

Attached is a rough draft of the convention memo to HRC.  Let me know if yo=
u have any edits.

Something I wasn't aware of: I can't get anyone at the DNC on the phone, bu=
t apparently the GOP has NOT locked in the last week of June.  They could s=
till choose the third week of July.  This changes things slightly, in that =
the two conventions could be back-to-back, although our two main points--mo=
ney and ceding the narrative the Republican over the summer still stand.

For the record, I talked to Plouffe today and he still maintains August is =
the smarter option. He acknowledged that July is safer and it would take a =
thick skin to survive until August.
