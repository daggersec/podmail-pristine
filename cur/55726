Hi John,
I just interviewed for the Executive Director for the Policy Institute for
Energy, Environment and the Economy at UC Davis yesterday.

Dan Sperling (of clean transportation fame) is the Chair of the search
committee and he would like to talk with you to get a reference.

Would you be willing to do this?  And if so, how best shall I connect him
with you?

thanks very much and hope all is well with you,
Kit
