Dear John, 

They say before you have cancer, you have lots of problems; and after you have cancer, you have just one. This year's election is just like that. Before Ebola, we had minimum wage, immigration, student loans, social security, and equal pay. Now we just have Ebola. And if they don't act fast, it's going to cost the Democrats the Senate. But it doesn't have to. In fact, Ebola may be the best thing that ever happened to the Democrats. If only they would realize it, before it's too late... 

Learn how to win the election HERE [ http://www.huffingtonpost.com/erica-payne/its-ebola-stupid_b_6063808.html ].
