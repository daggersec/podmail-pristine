Hi John,

 

Debbie and I had a chance to visit with Sandy today at home.  As you know,
the cancer is progressing.

 

We talked with him about what kind of legacy projects he would feel good
about.  One idea that emerged (just an idea) is to have some kind of
fellowship each year for one student interested in interning/working on
national security affairs-possibly a student from outside the beltway to
come to a DC organization and learn the trade.  Of course, we thought of
CAP, as a host institution, given Debbie and Sandy's close connection.  We
realize that you are no longer there, but wondered how you would react to
the idea and if so, how we might explore it a bit more.  At some point,
people will want to donate to a cause in Sandy's honor, and we wanted to get
his thoughts now on what would please him.  He also mentioned World Food
Program so that could be another idea.

 

We are doing our best to keep his spirits up.  Thanks for your constant
contact with him.  Best on the holidays to you and yours, Tara
