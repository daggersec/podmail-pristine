John --

This Thursday during the congressional recess, OFA supporters in =
Washington are getting together to visit your representative's local =
office.

We're sending one important message: We support passing comprehensive =
immigration reform now.

It's an opportunity to show the lawmakers who are on our side that we have =
their backs in this fight -- and let everyone who plans to stand in the =
way of reform know that we will hold them accountable.

Can you join in?

https://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/gskjf9

RSVP to be a part of the office visits this Thursday and voice your =
support for reform:

     What: Visit your representative's office in Washington

     Where: B40C Dirksen Senate Office Building
     Washington, DC 20510

     When: Thursday, May 2nd<br>
     11:00 am=20

RSVP now:=20

https://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/gskjf9

Two weeks ago, a bipartisan group of eight senators introduced =
groundbreaking legislation that gets us one step closer to passing =
comprehensive immigration reform.

We hear they'll be debating the issue in the Senate soon, and it'll be a =
big part of Congress' agenda over the next several weeks.

That's why lawmakers need to hear from their constituents while they're =
home over the recess.

Make your voice heard -- RSVP today to visit your local representative's =
office in Washington on Thursday:

https://my.barackobama.com/page/event/detail/gskjf9

Thanks,

Emmy
