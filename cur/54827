-- Speculation about the results of Donald Trump running as a third party
candidate. Al Sharpton says Donald Trump is helping HRC the most out of
anyone in the race. Sharpton reports on a New York Times article which says
HRC is using Trump against his own party. Shows clip of HRC saying Donald
Trump=E2=80=99s hair gets more attention than hers, but there is nothing fu=
nny
about the hate he is spewing. Sharpton says HRC wants Trump to continue to
thrive and there=E2=80=99s no sign that he=E2=80=99s getting out of the rac=
e any time soon,
even if it means as a third party candidate. Compares Trump to Ross Perot.

-- A.B. Stoddard comments on video of Planned Parenthood executive talking
about the cost of fetal body parts. Stoddard says that in this election
cycle, if a pro-choice democrat can=E2=80=99t come out and say, I=E2=80=99m=
 pro-choice but
this is really wrong and I=E2=80=99m sickened by this, then it=E2=80=99s an=
 opening for
Republicans to talk about this issue. Says that it=E2=80=99s not about talk=
ing
about abortion rights but instead it=E2=80=99s saying, let=E2=80=99s invest=
igate if they
are selling body parts at Planned Parenthood. Says it=E2=80=99s not just HR=
C who is
silent on this issue, but all of the Democrats. Special Report with Bret

-- Coverage of Mitch McConnell saying HRC is playing the gender card. Shows
clip of Senator McConnell saying he doesn=E2=80=99t think playing the gende=
r card
is enough. Chris Matthews says HRC responded in a Facebook chat, and shows
a quote of HRC=E2=80=99s response. Says this isn=E2=80=99t the first time M=
cConnell has
made a controversial comment on gender. Shows clip of McConnell at the
conservative political action conference two years ago saying the
Democrat=E2=80=99s 2016 presidential ticket is shaping up to look like a re=
-run of
The Golden Girls. Panel joins to comments. April Ryan says HRC is out of
the GOP fray right now so this is one of the ways Republicans are trying to
bring her back in. Ryan says HRC is a woman but has a pedigree no one else
has as Secretary of State, Senator, and First Lady, so she is someone to be
afraid of. Hardball with Chris Matthews

-- Panel comments on HRC=E2=80=99s appearance on Snapchat at the Iowa Democ=
ratic
Hall of Fame dinner. Kennedy shows clip of HRC=E2=80=99s Snapchat story fro=
m Cedar
Rapids. Joe DeVito says HRC looks stiff in the video. Jamie Weinstein says
he doesn=E2=80=99t know when the idea that we had to have a cool president =
came
about. Kennedy then shifts to McConnell=E2=80=99s attack on HRC playing the=
 gender
card. Shows HRC=E2=80=99s Facebook post response. Joanne Nosuchinsky says H=
RC tells
us that she is a grandmother and a wife. Says candidates play to their
strengths and Americans want to see a woman president, but the other cards
that HRC is playing include dishonesty and not being personable. Kennedy
says HRC=E2=80=99s response to Mitch McConnell includes advocating for equa=
l pay,
yet she did not play men and women equally when she worked in the Senate.
Weinstein says the gender pay equity gap is always exaggerated and that=E2=
=80=99s a
nice card for her to play, but McConnell is right in that what inspires her
supporters is not her, =E2=80=9Cgreat success in Libya or great mediocre to
non-existent Senate record,=E2=80=9D but the fact that she is a woman and t=
he
popularity of her husband. Says it=E2=80=99s not a good sign when the reaso=
n people
are voting for you is because of your gender or your husband. DeVito says
this shows that the GOP doesn=E2=80=99t know how to play this issue because
McConnell plays right into her hands and allows HRC to play a victim.
