FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: October 20, 2008

New York Times Article Confirms Urgent Need for McCain to Release
Medical Records

LOS ANGELES - Today's front page story in The New York Times confirmed
what doctors all over the country have been saying for months: It is
time for Senator McCain to disclose his medical history.

As noted in the Times article, over 2,800 medical doctors have signed
an open letter from Brave New PAC that urges McCain "to issue a full,
public disclosure of all of his medical records, available for the
media and members of the general public to review."  These doctors
have been especially concerned with a critically important question
described by The Times: "If Mr. McCain's 2000 left-temple melanoma was
a metastasis, as the Armed Forces pathologists' report suggested, it
would be classified as a Stage III.  The reclassification would change
his statistical odds for survival at 10 years from about 60 percent to
36 percent, according to a published study."

Dr. Ronald Bronow, former Chief of Dermatology at Cedars Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles, said: "The New York Times article demonstrates
precisely what we have been calling for: McCain needs to release these
records.  It is crucial that outside pathology consultation be allowed
to review in particular the records that cover Senator McCain's 2000
melanoma, in order to determine whether his melanoma is at Stage II or
Stage III."

Dr. Daniel Vlock, former Clinical Director of the Multidisciplinary
Melanoma Unit at Harvard Medical School's Brigham and Women's Hospital
and a signer of the open letter, said: "It is critical that the public
understand the stage of Senator McCain's melanoma.  Right now it is
unclear if his melanoma is Stage IIA or IIIB.  This is not an
insignificant distinction. Staging is a critical component of cancer
evaluation.  By determining the extent and spread of a cancer (its
stage) at the time of its removal, physicians are able to assess the
chances that the cancer will recur."

The 5- and 10-year survival probabilities of stage IIA and IIIB
melanoma are as follows:

Stage IIA: Localized melanoma between 2.0 and 4.0 mm thick
5-year survival rate: 79 %
10-year survival rate: 64%

Stage IIIB: Satellite metastases
5-year survival rate: 53%
10-year survival rate: 38%
