Dear John,

Today the League of Conservation Voters is naming former Club for Growth Pr=
esident and Pennsylvania Senate candidate Pat Toomey to the Dirty Dozen - a=
nd in doing so we're launching a new web ad highlighting his support of oil=
 drilling in the Great Lakes.

Watch Our Ad Here >>
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DP4gXfR96VBALudelYMk4hA..

In 2001, Toomey voted to allow drilling for oil and natural gas in the Grea=
t Lakes. But that's not all -- just this past June - despite the unfolding =
catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico -- he reiterated his support for drilling=
 in
Lake Erie. And his zeal for drilling doesn't just stop at the Great Lakes, =
he
also supports drilling in protected areas like the Arctic National Wildlife=
 Refuge.

Toomey has parroted Big Oil's misinformation and lies about climate legisla=
tion and other clean energy policies for years. From his time in Congress t=
o his stint running the ultra-conservative Club for Growth, Toomey has cons=
istently sided with Big Oil and other dirty polluters. In fact, over his ca=
reer, Toomey has received more than $294,000 from energy interests, includi=
ng $123,800 from the Oil and Gas industry. His lifetime LCV score is an aby=
smal 11 percent.=20

Make no mistake: If Toomey wins in November, he will do Big Oil's bidding=
=A0in the Senate and he'll lead the charge against sound environmental poli=
cies and EPA's ability to reduce global warming pollution from the nation's=
 biggest emitters.=20

We need more pro-environment allies in the Senate next year, not rubber sta=
mps for corporate polluters. If we ever want to get anything done to help o=
ur planet in 2011 and beyond, we can't let them win in November.

That's why this election is so important. Rep. Joe Sestak, who is running
against Toomey for Pennsylvania Senate, is an environmental champion who vo=
ted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act last year - a bill that
would have helped to build an American clean energy economy, reduce harmful=
 carbon pollution and curb our dangerous dependence on oil. During his two =
terms in Congress, Sestak has earned an outstanding 96% on LCV's National E=
nvironmental Scorecard.

We need more friends like Rep. Joe Sestak in the Senate, not more of Big Oi=
l's cronies. So please, take a moment to watch LCV's video and then
 share the video with three friends who vote in Pennsylvania.
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DmpttVBLWJxGF56J4FpGebw..

Thank you for all you do to protect the planet.=20

Sincerely,

Gene Karpinski
President
League of Conservation Voters
