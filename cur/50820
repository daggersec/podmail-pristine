=20
It is Our Moral  Responsibility to Help Haiti  =E2=80=93 And It=E2=80=99s=
 In America=E2=80=99s =20
Interest=20

For those of us who have a special place in our hearts for the =20
long-suffering people of Haiti, the horrific pictures and  tragic news rep=
orts of the=20
earthquake=E2=80=99s devastation seem as though they were  lifted directly=
 from the=20
biblical Book of Job. =20
The people of Haiti have borne so much sorrow, so  much suffering.  It=20
breaks your  heart. =20
My wife, Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, and I were both in  Haiti last year=
.=20
 Jan has been there many times before and  for a number of years has helpe=
d=20
support the work of Dr. Paul Farmer and his  remarkable organization =E2=
=80=93=20
Partners in Health =E2=80=93 as it has worked with the Haitian  government=
 to radically=20
improve health care in our hemisphere=E2=80=99s poorest  nation.=20
When we were there, it seemed that Haiti might be  approaching an economic=
=20
tipping point -- that a little ray of sunlight might  finally be breaking=
=20
through the dark years of poverty and exploitation. In  addition to the=20
expanding health care system, new highways have been paved.  The UN and Ha=
itian=20
government had  finally gotten a handle on the security situation. Just th=
e=20
other day we heard  about a huge new project to plant millions of trees in=
=20
this largely deforested  land =E2=80=93 a critical component for the count=
ry=E2=80=99s =20
long-term economic success.  Now this.=20
But one thing is striking.  Through it all, Haitians are remarkably=20
resilient and optimistic. =20
That=E2=80=99s why, out of this unspeakable tragedy, the one hope is that=
 this  can=20
be the occasion that draws the world=E2=80=99s attention to Haiti and crea=
tes the =20
resolve to provide the funds to give Haiti a chance =E2=80=93 after all th=
ese years =E2=80=93
 to  recreate itself.=20
Before yesterday=E2=80=99s disaster, Haiti needed $3 billion to execute th=
e dev
elopment plan  that has been designed by the government and international=
=20
community.  That is the equivalent to the price of  about ten F-22 fighter=
s.  Now,=20
of  course, it will need more.  But  frankly, for the price a few CEO=20
bonuses, the lives of 8.2 million people -- our  next-door neighbors -- co=
uld be=20
changed forever. =20
Of course the first priority is the massive rescue and relief effort that=
 =20
is being spearheaded today by the Obama Administration and international=
 aid=20
 organizations.  But we must hope  that the world=E2=80=99s concern will=
 not die=20
immediately once the worst of the  short-term suffering is ameliorated. An=
d =20
that=E2=80=99s not just because helping Haiti fundamentally escape its  po=
verty is=20
the right thing to do.  It is also the smart thing to do.=20
The world economy is not a zero sum game.  For us to be richer, someone=20
else  doesn=E2=80=99t have to be poorer.  In fact  just the opposite is tr=
ue.  =20
If you think of the earth as a huge space vehicle=E2=80=94or a ship at sea=
 -- it =20
just doesn=E2=80=99t make sense that a big proportion of the crew isn=E2=
=80=99t able to pull=20
its  weight because they are undereducated, unproductive and constantly in=
=20
need of  handouts from the rest of us. The Navy wouldn=E2=80=99t tolerate=
 it;=20
neither should the  world community.=20
The more skilled, the more  educated, the more productive, the more=20
efficient every one of us is, the more  successful we will all be in our=
 common=20
mission of forging a better life for  future generations. =20
Every  kid in Haiti who grows up to be a surgeon or  an engineer instead=
 of=20
a stoop laborer contributes to the common store of our  wealth. If a girl=
=20
is sentenced, by accident of her birth, to spend hours each  day washing=
=20
clothes in a Haitian stream instead of going to school, all of us  miss ou=
t on=20
the possibility that she might contribute to finding a cure for  cancer.=
 =20
Millions of minds are indeed a terrible  thing to waste.=20
And the effect of this waste plays itself out in the terms of pure =20
economics. Several years into the Great Depression, the New Deal began to=
 close =20
the gap between supply and demand in the American economy.  Roosevelt bega=
n to=20
use public sector demand to fill the  demand gap, and move the economy=20
toward full employment.  But Emperor Hirohito=E2=80=99s attack on Pearl =
 Harbor was=20
necessary to give America the political will to fully  utilize the tools=
 of the=20
New Deal =E2=80=93 to stop worrying about short-term deficits =E2=80=93 =
 and create full=20
employment.  After  all, it was do-or-die.=20
There was great concern at the end of World War II that demobilization =20
would result in a precipitous new economic downturn.  One of the major fac=
tors=20
that prevented  that downturn =E2=80=93 and fueled world economic growth=
 for the=20
next 20 years =E2=80=93 was the  Marshall Plan. America  invested massivel=
y in=20
rebuilding Europe.  In the short term, that created huge new  markets for=
 American=20
products.  In  the longer term, it allowed the rebirth of an economically=
=20
prosperous Europe that contributed to the store of our common  productive=
=20
capacity.=20
In the same way today, long-term economic growth in the developed world =
=20
will require a massive investment to jumpstart the economies of countries=
 like=20
 Haiti and the entire developing  world. And like the Marshall Plan, we=20
will all benefit.=20
In addition to that, helping  countries like Haiti escape poverty is about=
=20
our own  national security. The fact is that  an island of at least relati=
ve=20
prosperity cannot exist forever in a sea of  poverty.  Ask Louis XIV of =
=20
France how that works out. =20
Kids who grow up in  poverty in countries like Haiti don=E2=80=99t see the=
 =E2=80=9Cgood=20
life=E2=80=9D in  American commercials and movies and then resign themselv=
es to=20
suffer quietly. A  recent survey showed that 75% of the people in Haiti wa=
nt to =20
leave the country.  Many of them  will try, even if they risk their lives=
 in=20
a leaky wooden boat. Many will try to  come illegally to the United =20
States. =20
People have never left their homes and families to emigrate to foreign =20
lands unless they felt they had no choice.  The millions of immigrants at=
 our=20
borders are the waves crashing over the  seawalls of our island of relativ=
e=20
prosperity. If you want to do something serious about  illegal immigration=
,=20
you need to help create economies in countries like  Haiti and Mexico that=
 =20
allow people to believe they have a future there at home. Everything else=
  is=20
simply a band-aid. =20
Without economic development in Haiti, other children will grow up to join=
 =20
criminal gangs that promise them a relative fortune of a few thousand=20
dollars to  transport drugs to the United  States. =20
In other parts of the world kids like them will resort to strapping on =20
bombs in the vain hope of giving their lives some meaning. Or they=E2=80=
=99ll hijack =20
ships.  Or they will join  revolutionary movements to challenge the wealth=
=20
and power of those who have it. =20
A recent report made public by  our own CIA described world poverty as the=
=20
greatest single long-term threat to  world stability and our own national=
=20
security.   There has never been a time when  the old Catholic Worker slog=
an=20
was more correct: =E2=80=9CIf you want peace, work for  justice.=E2=80=9D=
=20
And finally, of course, it  is our moral responsibility.  Well-being is no=
t=20
just a matter of the number of rooms in our houses or  the quality of our=
=20
vacations.  People =E2=80=93 especially young people =E2=80=93 want meanin=
g in their lives. =20
They want to commit themselves to other  people =E2=80=93 not just for the=
 sake of=20
the other people =E2=80=93 but because it fulfills  them =E2=80=93 it make=
s them feel that=20
their lives matter.  Our well-being as individuals and as a  people is not=
=20
simply measured by our GDP.  It is measured by whether we can be proud of=
=20
ourselves.  =20
Right now to be proud of ourselves, we have to step up to help the people=
 =20
of Haiti.  Do what you can right now to help the  Red Cross and other reli=
ef=20
agencies cope with this massive humanitarian  crisis.  And once that=E2=80=
=99s=20
done, tell  your Members of Congress that one of the foundations of our ow=
n=20
long-term  economic security is creation of growth and opportunity in plac=
es=20
like  Haiti.=20
Robert Creamer is a long-time  political organizer and strategist, and=20
author of the recent book:  Stand Up Straight: How Progressives Can  Win,=
