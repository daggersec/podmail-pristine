Janet Butler and her husband Paul
Susie Mullens and her husband John

Coming Friday evening, guessing 6 ish, Sept 26.  They will call you with
better info on their arrival.

Below is last note from Janet.  They are away right now and back on Sept 23.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Love
Mary
Dear Mary,

John is so kind to offer to prepare dinner for us.  We would love to take
him out to dinner as a thank you for hosting us for two nights.  We have
not as yet arranged our departure time with John and Susie, but we'll plan
the trip so we can be in your area by 6ish, traffic willing.  We will keep
John posted by phone.

Have a wonderful trip.  We head out tomorrow morning.

Much love,
Janet
