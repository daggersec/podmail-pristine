This is in there:

And let me add, training a world-class workforce has to start at the very
beginning.  Every child in America should have a quality education, with
universal pre-K, good public schools in every ZIP code, and debt-free
tuition at public colleges and universities.  And Detroit:  I know how
important fixing your schools is to you and your kids, and as President, I
will fight for you in the White House.
