John -

We have less than 37 hours left before Kirsten's vital end-of-quarter filing deadline at midnight on Wednesday. We need to raise another $43,622 to show the pundits, press, and opponents that Kirsten is ready for November.

She's up against three self-funders -- two of whom have already thrown in almost $1 million each of their own money. Kirsten may never be able to match their deep pockets, but we need to give her the resources she needs to fight back from attacks from her GOP opponents this summer and win on Election Day -- just four months from now.

Click here to rush your donation to the campaign right now. Kirsten is counting on you to help her raise another $43,622 to meet her goal by June 30. [https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/827/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=8087 ]

Thanks for stepping up when it matters most.
