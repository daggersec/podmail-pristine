John -- Did you read James Carville's e-mail today? President Obama and =
Democrats nationwide need us right now.

If you donate $3 or more today, your gift will be matched =
dollar-for-dollar >> http://www.dccc.org/be-july4

Subject: nightmare

I wish I had good news for you.

I want to tell you that President Obama has a second term in the bag. I =
want to tell you that the Koch Brothers are giving up their plot to buy =
the election.

But here's where things really stand: We're gonna have to go through hell =
and high-water to win this damn thing. It's gonna be hard. Every big-oil =
billionaire and Republican Super PAC is throwing the kitchen sink at =
President Obama.

If we don't fight back, it'll be over long before November.

Contribute $3 or more to back up President Obama with a Democratic =
majority. Get your donation in today and it'll get matched =
>>http://www.dccc.org/be-july4

Every dollar we can muster will go straight to the front lines -- =
organizers on the ground and ads on the air hitting Republicans where it =
hurts.

If you're with us, then give what you can today:
http://www.dccc.org/be-july4

C'mon now!

James
