LCV is honoring Robert Redford with a Lifetime Achievement Award - will you add your name to our "thank you" card? http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=CKVHYJvuWnEe91ShSHsaVg

John,

Will you sign our "thank you" card to Robert Redford?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=MUOZy7ViGSBUaoJyS26GRQ

Most people probably know Robert Redford from his incredible movie career. But to me, he's always been an inspiring environmental leader and a great friend of the League of Conservation Voters.

For more than two decades, Robert has worked with LCV to elect environmental champions to Congress, defeat members of the "Dirty Dozen" and pass laws that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.

That's why I'm excited to announce that LCV will be honoring Robert with a Lifetime Achievement Award at our annual New York dinner later this month. Additionally, we also plan to give him a "thank you" card signed by LCV supporters.

Will you join us in thanking Robert Redford for his fierce commitment to protecting our environment? Add your name to our "thank you" card and we'll present it to him at our annual dinner: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=lIIuFWMLHD1xnaVbsUbGgg .

Robert is an ardent conservationist and environmentalist who stands for social responsibility and political involvement. His life-long passion for nature and issues of justice have resulted in Robert being widely acknowledged as a highly effective and dedicated political and environmental activist.

But for Robert, actions speaker louder than words - and over the years he's been deeply involved in many of LCV's most important campaigns. From recording radio ads that appear in congressional districts around the country to helping LCV raise money to ensure we have the resources we need to run hard-hitting campaigns, Robert has been with us every step of the way.

Please join me in thanking Robert Redford for being a dedicated and inspiring enviornmental leader by adding your name to our "thank you" card: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=Omi1tqS-nwe-bm1nkrNOzQ .

Thanks,

Gene Karpinski
President
League of Conservation Voters
