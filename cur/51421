An important story from my colleague Sam Stein.

 Afghan Ambassador Trumpets Obama
Agenda<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/30/afghan-ambassador-trumpet_n_115756.html>

Afghanistan's Ambassador to the United States trumpeted major portions of
Barack Obama's approach towards his country on Tuesday, marking the second
time in as many weeks that an official at the center of U.S.-Mideast policy
has echoed the Illinois Senator's agenda.

Said Jawad, who has been at the ambassador's post since 2003, avoided
specific references to Obama and his rival Sen. John McCain. But on a broad
range of issues that divide the two candidates -- defining the main
battleground in the war on terror, U.S. military commitments to Afghanistan,
and combating terrorist activity in Pakistan -- he agreed with the
prescriptions of the presumptive Democratic nominee.

Sipping occasionally from a glass of mint-flavored iced tea, the ambassador
argued that the war in Iraq had diverted military and material resources
from Afghanistan. He described the border his country shared with Pakistan
as "the central front of the war on terror, certainly," stressing the need
for additional American forces. And he offered what amounted to a heartfelt
endorsement of Obama's proposal to target high-level al Qaeda figures in
northwest Pakistan, even without that country's acquiescence.

"We would appreciate it if Pakistan could take full responsibility in
dealing with them," he said. "But if they can't, if they don't have the
resources, they should allow the international community to take these
elements out, for the sake of Pakistan, for the sake of Afghanistan, and for
the sake of the world. These are criminals. We should allow the humanity to
go out and eliminate these enemies of humanity. We should not fool ourselves
with the legal questions such as sovereignty."

Obama and McCain have differed on this policy, with the Arizona Republican
accusing his opponent of naivete and inexperience for proposing to "bomb" an
ally. The two candidates have also parted paths on the best way to address
the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, which this month has seen more
deaths of U.S. service members than Iraq. Obama has called for the
reallocation of two-to-three brigades of troops from the latter war to the
former - a "short-term surge" that Jawad, likewise, advocated.

"From the very beginning the U.S. and international community around
Afghanistan was following a policy known as a light footprint, which I see
as the wrong policy. We needed the right footprint for Afghanistan," said
the ambassador. Now, he added, Afghanistan "will require the surge of both
military resources and competence."

McCain, in contrast, has said he would encourage NATO countries to commit
more forces to Afghanistan -- a proposal that Jawad said would be important
but ultimately insufficient.

"The presence of NATO in Afghanistan is a political asset both for
Afghanistan, the United States and other countries," said the ambassador.
"The real security and military stakeholders in the fight against
international terrorism in Afghanistan are, however, Afghans and Americans.
And therefore, we appreciate the fact that NATO countries are there but we
need troops that are ready to fight. We need troops that are properly
equipped and ready to be deployed to all parts of the country."

Jawad was diplomatic in fielding questions on the 2008 presidential
campaign, stressing that Afghanis looked favorably on both candidates. "They
admire the courage and the military background of Sen. McCain," he said.
"And they really admire the youth and the energy of Sen. Obama. So they are
in both camps in this regard."

The bipartisan tone reflected what Jawad said was a critical need for
international support for his country, irrespective of who Americans elect.
But for Obama, the ambassador's statement will likely only enhance his
perception as a serious foreign policy thinker. Last week, Iraqi Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki specifically cited the Illinois Democrat's plans
for troop withdrawal as the proper template for a status of forces
agreement.

The remarks also play nicely into the Obama campaign's efforts to cast the
Senator as the lone candidate attentive to the burgeoning Afghanistan
crisis; a contrast to McCain and President Bush who remain focused on Iraq.
At times, Obama's commitment to the issue - specifically, his pledge to send
more troops into that theater - has provoked skepticism from even his own
informal advisers. In an interview with the Huffington
Post<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/25/brzezinski-warns-against_n_114999.html>last
week, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's national security
adviser
and an Obama endorser, warned that by sending more troops to Afghanistan,
the United States was "running the risk of unintentionally doing what the
Russians did."

But even in this regard Obama found an ally in Jawad. "We very much
appreciate Brzezinski's friendship and commitment for Afghanistan, which he
supported in 1980, but on this point he is still stuck in 1980," said the
Ambassador. "The real threat to Afghanistan's peace and prosperity in the
region is coming from terrorism. We have been asking for the involvement of
the United States even during the time the Soviets were there. And even
after they left we wanted the U.S. to play an important role. So it is a
totally different situation... The task of defending Afghanistan is
ultimately our job. And we will do it. There is no shortage of commitment or
courage. There is a shortage of skills and equipment."
