*June 8th Nightly Press Traffic Summary*



=C2=B7  Lisa Lerer (AP) piece wrapping up the ramp-up phase of our campaign
should run Wednesday.

=C2=B7  Jon Allen's piece about connections between Hillary Clinton and FDR
should run tomorrow. We have a quote from Kristina Schake that will be
included in the story. A couple other reporters are interested in this
storyline ahead of her launch rally on Roosevelt island.

=C2=B7  Amy Chozick is doing what seems like it will be a positive story ab=
out
Hillary Clinton's connection to the LGBT community.

=C2=B7  Elijah Cummings has an op-ed coming at some point this week on beha=
lf of
Democrats on the Benghazi committee about the continued politicization of
the tragedy.

=C2=B7  An LA Times story is scheduled for tomorrow about Carly Fiorina's
connections to the Clinton Foundation

=C2=B7  Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur is writing on Marco Rubio's immigration att=
acks
on HRC and Rubio's own record of immigration shifts.

=C2=B7  Amy Chozick/Maggie Haberman have been digging around on a story abo=
ut
campaign staffers, NYC real estate, and supporter housing. We're tracking
down more info.

=C2=B7  Annie Karni is writing about similarities between Jeb Bush and Hill=
ary
Clinton.

=C2=B7  Peter Nicholas at WSJ has been digging into top Obama donors to loo=
k at
the degree to which they have gotten involved in 2016

=C2=B7  Marc Caputo at POLITICO interviewed John Morgan about medical marij=
uana
and his conversations on the topic with HRC, and is likely to do a story
off it.

=C2=B7  Ben White at POLITICO is doing a story about HRC's ties to Wall Str=
eet.
We've pushed back with a quote/background about her record fighting to
protect consumers from abuses from big banks, and indicating she'll
continue to roll out policy proposals on that front.

=C2=B7  The Daily Caller is asking about a 1973 article that Hillary Clinto=
n
wrote in which she made comparisons between the lack of childhood rights +
institution of marriage to slavery. This was an attack launched against her
in 1992, 2000, etc. that they are attempting to revive.
