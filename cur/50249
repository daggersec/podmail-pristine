Commitment To Fixing System Is Real Reform Litmus Test
Obama must prove support for public financing in wake of decision to opt out
=20
Washington, DC =AD Public Campaign Action Fund, a national campaign finance
reform group, issued the following statement from its executive director,
Nick Nyhart, and its Campaign Money Watch director, David Donnelly, in
response to Sen. Barack Obama=B9s (D-IL) decision that he will opt out of th=
e
public financing system for the general election:

> =B3We have long maintained that presidential candidates would make a decis=
ion to

blic

 we

ection

ith
