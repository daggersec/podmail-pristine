Madame Secretary,
The full strategy team (Benenson, Anzalone, Wendy, Margolis...need to
confirm Mandy) will be meeting in NYC on the 5th to discuss and ratify the
full research strategy.  We will then present the full plan to you.
Through a minor miracle, David Binder is able to do focus groups in Iowa on
the 6th and 7th and I'd like to move forward organizing them, since it will
keep us on schedule with the original timeline.  I wanted you to sign off
on the entire research program before we start, but I don't see any reason
to delay if Binder is available.  And there's no way we WON'T want Iowa
groups!
The strategy team will have plenty of time to weigh in over the next few
days, so it's actually perfect timing (and a good warm up for the full
plan).
The cost for the Iowa groups will be $42k.
Let me know if you have any issues with us moving forward with this plan
and I'd be happy to discuss by phone if you want.
