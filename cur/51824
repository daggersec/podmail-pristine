Hey Guys,

Sorry to double up on requests, but just heard about some comments
O'Malley made re: Secretary Clinton in Boston.

He was asked about her positions on gay marriage and immigration and
framed them as her having "come around."

Quotes are below, let me know if you want to respond.

"I=E2=80=99m glad Secretary Clinton=E2=80=99s come around to the right posi=
tions on
these issues=E2=80=A6I believe that we are best as a party when we lead wit=
h
our principles and not according to the polls. And every election is
about the future. And leadership is about making the right decision,
and the best decision before sometimes it becomes entirely popular."

"I=E2=80=99m glad Secretary Clinton has come around to the right positions =
on
both these issues. I believe marriage is a human right, not a state
right. I=E2=80=99m glad she=E2=80=99s come around to that position as well.=
 I believe
that we do our country a disservice when we make it harder for new
American immigrants to abide by the rules of the road and obtain
drivers licenses. And I=E2=80=99m glad she=E2=80=99s come around to that po=
sition now
too."

Will be doing this one in the next 30 minutes or so. Of course, can
update or follow up.

Thanks,
Hunter
