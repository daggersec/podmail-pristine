Dear Members and Friends of the Board:

I am writing to update you regarding developments at ThinkProgress.  We bel=
ieve the writers of ThinkProgress are on the cusp of being able to form a u=
nion, with supermajority support.  They are working with Writers Guild of A=
merica East as their collective bargaining representative.  If our due dili=
gence efforts confirm this, our intention is to voluntarily recognize the u=
nion.  This would be consistent with CAP/AF's strong and vocal support for =
workers' collective bargaining rights.

Writers at Gawker and Salon have also recently unionized with the Writers G=
uild.  This is part of a broader trend toward organization by reporters in =
new media.  In addition, Media Matters recently unionized, though quite con=
tentiously, with political criticism of its handling coming from both the r=
ight and the left.

We believe the ThinkProgress unionization effort is significantly driven by=
 ideology and solidarity, and we have not seen any indication that the writ=
ers have major complaints with their current working conditions.  Consequen=
tly, we hope that the next step in this process - bargaining with the union=
 toward a contract for the ThinkProgress writers - will not be particularly=
 contentious.  Nor, at this time, do we expect the union to have an adverse=
 effect on the great work ThinkProgress has been doing.  As I hope the boar=
d knows, we focus particular attention on efficient and effective managemen=
t of our institution.  This is particularly critical for a non-profit which=
 does not have the same kind of market mechanisms of for-profits to produce=
 efficiencies.  It is my hope that the ThinkProgress union will be a helpfu=
l partner in managing toward efficiency and effectiveness in ThinkProgress'=
s ongoing work.

Our understanding is that there may be separate efforts, by a different uni=
on, to organize other workers at CAP/AF.  As required by law, we are taking=
 a hands-off approach to these efforts.  We will keep you informed of furth=
er developments and plan to discuss these efforts in more detail in the upc=
oming board meeting.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  And as always, thank you for=
 all you do for CAP.

Best,
Neera
