 which included the rededicating of Alumni Hall and the approval of Knox 20=
18 was an exciting time for Knox and all of us.

>                    You may recall during the meeting that we amended the =
bylaws to allow for the election of a Chair Elect during the last year of t=
he current Chair's term.  I am in the last year of my term and I have decid=
ed not to seek election as Chair for a second term. As a result, we will in=
itiate the  process to select a Chair Elect. I will ask Dave Schulz to lead=
 this important initiative and would encourage any Trustees interested in t=
his role to contact Dave or myself. =20
>=20
>                      I mentioned during our last meeting a desire to move=
 Trustees into leadership roles on a more accelerated pace and I believe to=
 set the example it should start with the role of Board Chair.  I am confid=
ent that we have the talent to allow for orderly succession with out missin=
g a beat. As a Board we should feel proud of our accomplishments and the mo=
mentum that has been generated. The Board has never been stronger and I kno=
w the selection of the Chair Elect in preparation for their role as Chair w=
ill build upon this progress.  At our February Meeting we will elect the Ch=
air Elect.  Please be prepared to give input to the Nominating Committee be=
tween now and the February Meeting. =20

if you would like to be considered so that you are not asked to serve on th=
