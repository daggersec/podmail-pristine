Hello Mr. Podesta,

My name is Ronald Owens and you and I spoke a few months ago when Mrs.
Clinton announced her bid in the 2016 Presidential Election. When we spoke,
you connected me with the Michigan Grassroots Organizer to discuss how I
can be involved in helping to bring Hillary to Michigan!

My vision, for when I return back to Michigan, is to bring Hillary to
Michigan State University and whip as many votes as possible. Michigan
State has over 50,000 students and could make a big impact on the Michigan
electoral vote.

I am, currently, in Washington DC until Saturday, August 8th, and if you
have time I would like to sit down with you and discuss what you vision for
bringing Hillary to MSU and what you expect of me.

If you have time, please let me know!

Best,

Ronald E. Owens III
