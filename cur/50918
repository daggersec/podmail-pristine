I'm meeting with McEntee on Friday.  Setting up a call with Sperling.
John, how do unions contribute to the messaging?  Mattzzie's entity
doesn't take union money.

GS has put 2.5 in so far of 5 commit. Not earmarked assumption was that
FfA would make the allocation 50-50. But we are flexible. I agree we
need to hit Mc hard, yesterday. Tom feels under-resourced, I know.

I would support front loading money to campaign to defend. So long as we
did not starve AV. I think money will flow more easily after primary is
settled.

I don't think George will have a strong view on the allocation, beyond
sharing your general pref for ground--because he doesn't like TV
advrtsing.

If you ask him to think about additional funds stress that the message
operation is multiplatform. Not primarily broadcast TV.

Over and above the five million?
Is SEIU going to go beyond that? Bing? Directly to campaign to defend?
