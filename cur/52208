Hi John-

Just chatted with tech here about your best options on devices. They're
pretty insistent that you switch over to an iPhone (or Android smart phone,
but I think iPhone will be easier) because their security software won't
function on a Blackberry. They're also running the office lines out of an
app, so you'll need a smart phone in order to have an HRC office line.
They're good with also getting you an iPad.

Because of the security protocol that they've set up I'd recommend going
with the newest devices, which come equipped with the touch ID unlock
system, which allows you to use your fingerprint to unlock the device
instead of having to type in a 6 digit passcode every 30 seconds (what the
system requires). Below you'll find what I think are your best options,
with pricing. Both would be hooked up to data on your cell plan-- if we
need to increase your data plan we can do so.

*iPhone 6* <http://store.apple.com/us/buy-iphone/iphone6>
16GB 4.7in display: $199.00 (with 2 year contract)

*iPad mini 3* <http://store.apple.com/us/buy-ipad/ipad-mini-3>
16GB (smallest storage available): $399.00

The way they've been doing this is just having assistants (me) order or buy
from the store. You'd pay for it out of your stipend-- checking on these
details with finance.

Let me know how all this sounds to you and I can figure it out. Hopefully
we'll have this stuff all ready and set up before you get in to the office
on Thursday.

Thanks!
