Dwight and Mary Ellen-- Thank you so much for getting back to us!    Would
love to chat when you return, no need to put the cocktail down ;)  We are
working on early August, but of course nothing is confirmed yet.

John's not off the hook, HRC will warm up the crowd for JP!

I've spoken to Josh Kardon and a few others including Beth Bernard (who you
and I met through at Mt. Hood a few years ago).  I know that Wyden is on
board and I'll talk to Carol Butler today as well.  There are a few 2008
donors who I want to be sure to include as well.

Let me know when you are back, or call when you arrive!  206-851-5092  Have
a great trip and travel safe!
