RELEASE: The McCain-Palin Plan For Virginia

With Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin set to appear in Fairfax
tomorrow, the Center for American Progress Action Fund released two new
analyses of the impact of their plans on Virginia.

WASHINGTON,DC-A new report
<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/virginia-h
ealth-care.pdf> , John McCain's Radical Health Care Agenda, describes
the consequences of McCain's health care plan for Virginia. Millions of
Virginians could lose the coverage they get from their jobs, forcing
them to shop for health coverage in a deregulated insurance market
stripped of consumer protections. Many Virginians with health problems,
such as cancer or diabetes, would find it particularly difficult or even
impossible to find adequate coverage. Millions of Virginia families, and
more and more Virginia families over time, would pay higher taxes on
health premiums.

A new fact sheet
<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/state-stats-virginia/> , The
McCain-Palin Plan for Virginia by the Numbers, provides a by-the-numbers
examination of what their agenda will mean for the citizens of Virginia:

*	4.5 million people in Virginia, including approximately 1.7
million women, have employer-based health insurance and are at risk of
losing it under John McCain's plan. [Source: CAPAF 1
<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/mccaintax/mccainstate
bystate.pdf> , 2
<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/pdf/womens_health.pdf
> ]=20
*	1.6 million people in Virginia, including around 890,000 women,
with pre-existing conditions, currently covered by their employer, would
find it particularly expensive or even impossible to get coverage under
John McCain's plan. [Source: CAPAF 1
<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/mccaintax/mccainstate
bystate.pdf> , 2
<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/pdf/womens_health.pdf
> ]=20
*	An Virginia couple making $60,000 a year will see their taxes go
up by $1,500 by 2013 under John McCain's health plan. [Source: CAPAF
<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/mccaintax/mccainstate
bystate.pdf> ]=20
*	The average Virginia worker has seen their real wages increase
$3,400 since 2000, some of the fastest income growth in the nation. But
from 1992 to 1999 real median family income rose $7,800 across the
South. (Virginia-only data unavailable.) [Source: Census 1
<http://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/acs-09.pdf> ,2
<http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/histinc/f06AR.html> ]=20
*	Virginia taxpayers will spend $1.1 billion on subsidies and tax
breaks for big oil and gas companies under John McCain over the next
five years. [Source: CAPAF
<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/pdf/oil_subsidies.pdf
> ]=20
*	Virginia taxpayers are paying approximately $290 million a month
for the war in Iraq. [CAPAF analysis of CACN
<http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/securityspending/articles/suppl
emental_war_funding/> ]=20
*	Since 2003, Virginia taxpayers have paid $19 billion for the
Iraq war. [CAPAF analysis of CACN
<http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/securityspending/articles/suppl
emental_war_funding/> ]=20
