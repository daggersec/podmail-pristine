John,



I wanted to send a quick note to let you know that tomorrow morning it will
be public that I've accepted a position as the new Executive Director of
EMILY's List. My time at CAP has been tremendous and I am incredibly
grateful to Neera and to you for the opportunity to play such an integral
role at CAP over the past 2 and a half years. I've learned so much and am
in awe of the talent and dedication of the CAP team.



While the timing isn't perfect, these things often aren't, I don't leave in
any way unhappy with CAP or the team. To the contrary, I'm proud of what
Neera and the team have accomplished and how hard Neera works to maintain
the ideas and innovation that have driven CAP from the beginning. I have
learned a great deal from her and admire her intellect, passion, and
tenacity. Honestly, there is very little that could have moved me from CAP,
but this unique opportunity is a dream one for me.



I hope that any work I've done will help sustain the next round of talented
leaders that join Neera and the Executive team to ensure the sustainability
and efficacy of the institution. I would count myself very lucky were our
paths to cross again. Thank you for your service and all of your work to
develop so many progressive leaders throughout your career.



Sincerely,
Jess O'Connell
