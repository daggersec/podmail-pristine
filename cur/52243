My only concern is we keep rewriting the reason why she started in a public=

Isn't this the third variation on this?

Agree.  Thematically it should begin with values, where we are now and why =
we can't go on this way ( strengthen communities);  her vision about a new =
commitment and close with values

WJC has talked about these issues as not having a person to waste:

And so we must say to every American: Look beyond the stereotypes that blin=
d us. We need each other. All of us, we need each other. We don't have a pe=
rson to waste.

I think Karen=92s point on the language from Urban League or the graph abov=

that she=92s speaking out on it but without a  powerful ending or nut graph=
 that sums the call to action for the soul of America, this will be OK but =
it will largely be a litany of a policies.

We could leave out the =93so my friends=85.=94 Intro and use this graph.  I=
t=92s quite powerful and as Karen notes this brings in a lot of emotional p=

Broadly - the phrase "communities of color" feel over used - we can say "pe=
ople" or " too many Americans" given that its clear this piece is about min=
ority communities; Shouldn't it end with more of a personal appeal to the h=
eart?

Also it feels strange to say that only communities of color marched - it wa=
s a mult-racial, multi-generational, multi-regional movement; we can just u=
se the line about Rosa Parks and MLK, John Lewis.

When people talk about the enduring impacts of racism, are they thinking of=
 early childhood education - which feels more like part of the "new commitm=
ent"; or disparities in access to capital for small businesses and lending =
practices?  the policy ideas in the last graph also feel like they belong w=
ith the new commitment language.

HRC has also made the powerful point that beyond systemic inequities, racis=
m itself is still a problem - we should end on that larger point with some =
optimism about who we are as a country - pulled from some of her best speec=
hes:

"So my friends, it really comes down to this, if we're going to repair the =
fraying fabric of our communities and rebuilding the bonds of trust and res=
pect, every American needs to step up.  There are laws we should pass, prog=

s even if they are different from us, in fact especially if they are.  Most=
 of all it's how we teach our children how they see others, how they see hu=
manity."

URBAN LEAGUE:

"This is not just about statistics, as damning as they can be.  This is abo=
ut Americans doing some soul-searching and holding ourselves to account.  T=
his is about all of us looking into our hearts, examining our assumptions a=
nd fears, and asking ourselves:  What more can I do in my life to counter h=
ate and injustice?  How can I make our country a better, fairer place?
That empathy =96 that=92s what makes it possible for people from every back=
ground, every race, every religion, to come together as one nation.  That=
=92s the kind of generosity of spirit that makes a country like America end=
ure.  And given what we=92ve seen and experienced over the last two years, =
this is an urgent call for people to search their own hearts and minds."
