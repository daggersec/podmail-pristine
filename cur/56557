Dear John -

Since we launched our powerful new ad on background checks, it's been =
viewed tens of thousands of times, played on Rachel Maddow, and called =
"The ad that will pass gun safety legislation."

You should watch it.

We're going to start running a version of the spot in a few states to give =
Senators the cover they need to vote for a bill. But there are a few more =
places we need to shore up support, and there's no better messenger on =
this issue than veterans who understand the power of these weapons.

If you think background checks are important, watch our ad right now and =
contribute $5 or more to VoteVets to help us put it in a few more states =
with Senators we need to pass a bill.

http://action.votevets.org/provide-cover

When the vote happens and you skim the roll call vote to see which =
senators voted which way, know that your contribution today made a real =
difference.

Best,

Jon Soltz
