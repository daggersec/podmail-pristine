Dear Supporter,=20

It seems like every election analysis article had the same message: Republi=
cans are living in the technological stone age, and it helped cost them the=
 presidency in 2012. *There are a lot of Republican allies who listened to =
that message and decided to use their money to do something about it.*=20

Right now, one group is putting the finishing touches on a state-of-the-art=
 digital platform, called Central Organizing Responder. It's available to a=
ll GOP candidates=E2=80=A6for a hefty price, of course.=20

What's the point of throwing all your energy into building a tool that only=
 a few wealthy candidates will be able to afford? We don't think there is o=
ne. *At ActBlue, we work day in and day out to build the best possible soft=
ware for Democrats up and down the ballot, and we let them use it for free.=
*=20

It takes a lot of hard work to build the best tools out there and also make=
 them scalable and free, but it's important if the left is going to succeed=
. No one writes us big checks to make this possible. We rely on small donor=
s like you. *Can you chip in $5 a month to help support our tech team so we=
 can innovate and continue to offer our tools to all Democrats and progress=
ives? [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/empowering?refcode=3Demp=
_t3_t&amp;amount=3D10.00&amp;recurring=3D24 ]*=20

If we've learned anything in the past few years, it's that local and state =
elections matter just as much as the big ones. *A good chunk of the outrage=
ous anti-women, anti-immigrant, and anti-science legislation that has been =
passed in the last few years has come from Republican controlled state legi=
slatures.* We think it's our duty to help Democrats in down-ballot races an=
d ballot initiative fights by giving them the tools they need to fight off =
these attacks.=20

Without ActBlue, many campaigns and organizations would be forced to spend =
big money on software, when they could be devoting it to getting out the vo=
te. Our mission is to help these groups raise more money, not spend more.=
=20

*With so many campaigns engaged in tough 2014 battles, we need your help. C=
an you donate $5 a month to help us make our tools available to every campa=
ign and organization that needs us? [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute=
/page/empowering?refcode=3Demp_t3_b&amp;amount=3D10.00&amp;recurring=3D24 ]=
