They are phasing in the cuts more slowly for both new *and *existing
customers--12 years instead of 4--but they did not do anything to fix the
grandfathering issue for existing customers. (So our statement in support
of Reid-King and general answer expressing concern for existing customers
still stands on its own two feet.)

Unclear whether this will be enough of a fix to keep new customers coming
for rooftop solar--we haven't heard anything yet from the industry. Could
ping if useful.


Nevada PUC to phase-in net metering cuts more slowly for all customers
By Esther Whieldon

The Nevada Public Utilities Commission today decided to lump all existing
and future net metering rooftop solar customers together and make the
drastic changes to the program kick in for everyone over the next 12 years,
a last-minute shift from their plan to only slow down the changes for
existing participants.

The PUC stuck to its decision to cut the payments to rooftop solar
customers who sell excess power back to their utility and add new charges
to their bill. The PUC was expected

reject calls to grandfather in existing customers and instead apply the
changes slowly over 12 years, instead of four. But Chairman Paul Thomsen
proposed to instead apply the changes across the board in the name of
treating everyone the same and preventing confusion over whom the changes
apply to.

Nevada is part of a national effort by big utilities to chip away at state
residential solar incentive programs that hurt the companies' profit
margins. Pro-solar groups have a variety of objectives - curbing climate
change, cutting electricity bills, promoting free market choice and
protecting their solar business.

The PUC's December decision prompted a number of rooftop solar companies to
leave the state, although many continue to fight the changes.

The Bring Back Solar Alliance, an industry-backed group, today said more
than 55,000 supporters have committed to sign petitions for a ballot
measure to repeal the PUC's decision. Once the Nevada Secretary of State
certifies the measure, the group has until mid-June to gather signatures.
