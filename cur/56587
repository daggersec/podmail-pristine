Friend,

I am very proud of my husband.

Terry has consistently stood up for the things he believes in -- even in =
the face of misleading attacks from a select group of Tea Partiers who =
will say anything to advance their extreme agenda.

I know you don't believe the bizarre fiction they're weaving, but I also =
know that the people making these false and ugly negative attacks have =
deep pockets. And, unfortunately, money can buy you a lot in an election.

That's why it's incredibly important that we have the funds to fight back =
against these smears. Our first-quarter fundraising deadline is tomorrow, =
and we're just $23,192 away from reaching our goal.

Will you make a $5 donation to help us reach our goal, so we have the =
resources to educate voters about the real Terry?

https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/tomorrows-deadline

Here's the truth -- Terry is completely focused on standing up for middle =
class families. Terry grew up in a middle class family, and he knows what =
it's like to have to work hard to get things done.

Whether it's his relentless pursuit of new jobs for Virginia, or his firm =
commitment to bringing Virginia's transportation infrastructure into the =
21st Century -- everything stems from that core focus.

I know that if he is given the opportunity to serve, Terry will work hard =
to make sure that the Commonwealth is working in the best way possible for =
all Virginians.

And a strong first financial report of the year is a crucial step towards =
achieving that goal.

Please support Terry with a $5 donation before tomorrow's midnight =
deadline:

https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/tomorrows-deadline

Thank you so much for standing alongside Terry at this critical moment,
Dorothy McAuliffe
