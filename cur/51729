HFA Senior Staff:

I am humbled and honored to be working with you all this weekend as your
guest facilitator for the retreat.

Marisa has done an amazing job of getting the logistics ready for the
weekend (with a huge assistant from Dennis on the house in CT). We are
going to be spending 24 hours together in an incredible place. Thanks,
Marisa.

I wanted to check in today on two things. (Look for a few more emails from
me over the next two days).

First, I sent you all individual emails yesterday with a request to fill
out a survey. In case you missed the email from me, the link to the form is
here:

http://goo.gl/forms/pHOxOMnEU6

Please try to fill this out today. Thank you for doing this.

Second, we are going to start the retreat with a session on who you are and
why you are doing this work. I am asking each of you to bring an object
that represents who you are and why you are sacrificing so much to do this
work.

Please bring something physical that represent who you are -- it could be a
photograph, a poem, a piece of art, something a loved one gave you -- any
symbol of something important to you about where you come from, who you are
and why you are here.  We are going to ask each of you to start off the
session with a short 3-4 minute talk using this object to reflect on your
story and your values.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

We will be sending around an agenda later today or tomorrow morning at the
latest.

Thanks,

Jeremy
