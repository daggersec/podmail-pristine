Subject: Touching base re possible DNCC opening
From: Anthony Bailey <baileynagase@gmail.com>
To: John Podesta <john.podesta@gmail.com>

Mr. Podesta:


I hope this e-mail finds you well. I apologise for calling you today while
you were in a meeting. I was just following up after our talk a week and a
half ago. In that discussion, I mentioned an interest in joining the DNCC
to help out candidates who support the democratic ticket and you said you
would look into the matter.  You told me to touch base with you in a week
or so.

I know you are busy and have a very full slate but I hope you sense a
strong desire in me to contribute and a fervent wish to use my skills set
for that purpose. In the spirit of being proactive, I looked at the DNCC
website and saw that there is a Marketing Compliance Associate position
available. The position requires knowledge of general compliance
principles, specifically  knowledge of FEC compliance rules along with
other compliance maintenance duties. I have reviewed the FEC Compliance
rules and know that the FEC rules can be easily learned. Given my general
compliance knowledge and experience in the private sector, I believe that
my experience and skills would be easily transferable to this position. All
I need is a solid recommendation to get my resume seen apart from the
general mill of resumes for such a position. If possible, I could use your
help in this regard.

I hope this does not sound arrogant but I do not believe in accidents. For
some months, I have wanted to contribute to the political fray at this
crucial time in the body politic. I just did not see how I could do so.
Then I happened to bump into you on #4 train in August  What were the
chances of that? I am hopeful it was not for naught and that your help will
make me realise my dream to help democratic candidates , incliding Mrs
Clinton, win in this crucial, upcoming presidential year.

Re other matters, I am very pleased to see that the campaign has ultilised
Majority Leader Macarthy's flub to good use. With Macathy's speakership
campaign flushed down the toilet, hopefully the Clinton campaign can get
that idiotic Benghazi Committee retired and the waste of tax payer money
will soon end.   Good hunting. I only wish I could be helping you in some
way.


Regards,


Anthony Bailey
