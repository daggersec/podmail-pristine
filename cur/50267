One Month Ago Today, the Iraqi Prime Minister Put John McCain in a Tough
Spot

Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Monday raised the prospect of

talks for a new security agreement to replace the U.N. mandate for their
presence that expires on December 31. [Reuters, 7/7/08

FoxNews.com: Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki told a German magazine
that he supports Barack Obama's plan to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq
within 16 months of taking office.  The apparent endorsement of a
cornerstone of Obama's foreign policy drew swift praise from the Obama
campaign..."U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16
months. That, we think, would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal,
with the possibility of slight changes," al-Maliki told the magazine Der
Spiegel. He said he wants U.S. troops to leave "as soon as possible." [

=20

Where's the Goal Post in Iraq This Week, Sen. McCain?

=20

Early 2003: The End is "Very Much in Sight."

=20

McCain Predicted a "Brief, Successful War In Iraq." While speaking on
the floor of the senate on the day before U.S. military action commenced
in Iraq, McCain said, "The costs of these enterprises are not known with
any degree of certainty at this time.  Nor are the costs we will incur
after what I believe, what I fervently, hope, will be a brief,
successful war in Iraq, as we seek to establish the foundations for a
peaceful, stable and democratizing Iraq."  He added, "I believe the war
in Iraq can be concluded successfully in a relatively brief time."
[McCain Senate Press Release, 3/18/03]

=20

McCain Believed The War In Iraq Would Be Relatively Short.  While
appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," McCain said, "I believe that this
conflict is still going to be relatively short. I believe we've achieved
significant goals and successes." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 3/30/03]

=20

In 2003 McCain Said The End Was "Very Much In Sight."  Senator McCain
was asked "At what point will America be able to say the war was won?"
McCain said there were oil fields to secure and "die-hards" to take care
of but "it's clear that the end is very much in sight, and today I think
Americans should be very proud of their leadership, their
technology...There are still some foreigners, Syrians and others hanging
around. But it won't be long. It will be a fairly short period of time,
but this happens in wars. I'm confident that once they are confident the
area is no longer a threat to the Marines and to or army troops that
they'll start imposing discipline. In the meantime, we'll have a short
period of chaos."  [ABC, Good Morning America, 4/9/03, emphasis added]

=20

In April 2003, McCain Said He Was "Sure" The End Of Conflict In Iraq Was
Near.  While appearing on "Lou Dobbs Moneyline," Dobbs asked McCain, "Is
it your judgment that we are near the end of this conflict?"  To which
McCain replied, "Oh, I'm sure that's true." [CNN, "Lou Dobbs Moneyline,"
4/10/03]

=20

=20

October 2003: Five Years?

=20

McCain Predicted The War Would Take "Four Or Five Years."  During an
appearance on ABC's Nightline, Ted Koppel asked McCain how much more
money the war would cost.  He said, "Estimates I hear as much as 50 to
$55 billion more." When asked, "Over a course of how many years?" McCain
answered, "Four or five years." [ABC, "Nightline," 10/1/03]

=20

November 2003: A Few Months?

=20

McCain Said "We Would Probably Know Within The Next Few Months" If
America Won Or Lost In Iraq.  During an appearance on MSNBC's "Buchanan
& Press," McCain was asked what "victory" in Iraq was.  McCain said, "I
think the next three to six months are very critical in this whole
scenario because the Iraqi people don't want to go back to Saddam
Hussein. They're not crazy. But many of them in the Sunni Triangle are
losing any confidence that the United States can bring them what their
ambitions are all about for themselves and their families. So I think
we're in a very critical time. And we would probably know within the
next few months." [MSNBC, "Buchanan & Press," 11/6/03]

=20

2004: Five Years?

=20

McCain Said "Listen, My Friend, We're Going To Have To Be There For Five
or Six Years."  During a February 2004 appearance on MSNBC's "Hardball,"
McCain discussed the war in Iraq and said, "Listen, my friend, we're
going to be there for five or six years. A little straight talk. We're
going. We're going to have to be there for quite a while." [MSNBC,
"Hardball," 2/25/04]

=20

Early-2005: One Year?

=20

McCain: "I Would Think That It's Going To Be Another Year To A Year And
A Half."  During an appearance on CBS's "The Early Show," McCain was
asked "What is a realistic timetable" regarding the war in Iraq? McCain
said, "If I had to guess, I would think that it's going to be at least
another year to a year and a half, but, hopefully before then we could
have our troops out of a lot of the areas where they're vulnerable to
casualties." [CBS, "The Early Show," 2/3/05]

=20

Mid-2005: A Couple of More Years?

=20

McCain: "I Think Part Of That Is It's Going To Be, At Least, A Couple
More Years."  While appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," McCain said, "I
don't think Americans believe that we should cut and run out of Iraq by
any stretch of the imagination. But I think they also would like to be
told, in reality, what's going on and, by the way, I think part of that
is it's going to be, at least, a couple more years." [NBC, "Meet the
Press," 6/19/05]

=20

McCain: "I Think We Should Tell People It's Not Going To Be A Short-I'd
Rather Say Two Or Three Years."  While appearing on NBC's "Meet the
Press," McCain said, "And, again, I think we should tell people it's not
going to be a short--I'd rather say two or three years, and be surprised
a year from now, than say, 'Everything's fine,' and then be disappointed
a year or two from now." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 6/19/05]

=20

McCain: I Think It's Very Possible "Within The Next Year or Two."  While
appearing on "Meet the Press," McCain said, "I think it's going to be
long and hard and tough."  Tim Russert asked, "Years?" McCain responded
by saying, "Well, when I say years, I think that it's very possible
within the next year or two that you could see this transition taking
place, but the American troops being a supplement rather than being
replaced by, in other words, most of the effort being carried on over
time by the Iraqis, but it's going to be tough. " [NBC, "Meet the
Press," 12/4/05]=20

=20

2006: Months?

=20

McCain: "We're Either Going To Lose This Thing or Win this Thing Within
the Next Several Months."  While appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press,"
McCain said, "If you talk to most military experts, we're in a critical
and crucial time. We're either going to lose this thing or win this
thing within the next several months." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 11/12/06]

=20

Early 2007: Ten Years?

=20

McCain Said Americans Could Be Persuaded To Support The War For 5 to 10
Years.  According to the Houston Chronicle, while at the opening of the
Center for the Intrepid, "McCain said it was important for America to
'accomplish the mission' in Iraq, but said he didn't know how long that
would take. He said Americans could be persuaded to support the conflict
another five to 10 years 'if we can show progress.'" [Houston Chronicle,
1/30/07]

=20

Mid 2007: "I Don't Have A Date"

=20

McCain Said "I Don't Have A Date" When Asked About The End of The War.
While discussing the war in Iraq on NBC's "Meet the Press," McCain said,
"If it is only in a role that is of support and American casualties are
minimal, then I think it's probably worth the investment. If the level
of casualties stays where it is, and we do not have success, then we
know that that will be a condition that we cannot stand before."  Tim
Russert then asked, "By when?" to which McCain replied, "I don't have a
date, I think that the important thing is whether we assess as we move
along." [NBC, "Meet the Press," 5/13/07; emphasis added]

=20

Early 2008: Months?

=20

McCain Said Winning The War "Is Going To Take Months."  During an
interview with the editorial board of the Detroit News, McCain was
asked, "Can we win this war? And how long will it take?" McCain
responded, "It is going to take months. Al-Qaida is on the run, but it
is not defeated. [The Iraqi military] can be effective with our support.
I know how frustrated all of us are with the lack of effectiveness of
the Iraqi government. ... Whoever invented this form of government ought
to be taken out and shot. There has been some progress..." [Detroit
News, 1/3/08]

=20

Early 2008: A Hundred Years?

=20

McCain Said US Could Stay In Iraq for "Maybe A Hundred Years" and He Was
"Fine" With It.  In January 2008, McCain said the U.S. military could
stay in Iraq for "a hundred years" and that "would be fine with me."  At
a town hall meeting in New Hampshire, a questioner said, "President Bush
is talking about our staying in Iraq for 50 year," at which point McCain
interrupted and said, "Make it a hundred.  We've been in South Korea,
we've been in Japan for 60 years, we've been in South Korea for 50 years
or so.  That'd be fine with me as long as Americans are not being
injured, or harmed, or wounded, or killed.  That's fine with me, I hope
it would be fine with you." [Town Hall Meeting in Concord, NH, 1/3/08
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D6LEFrZCNqss> ; emphasis added]

=20

McCain: "I Don't Think Americans Are Concerned If We're There For 100
Years Or 1,000 Years Or 10,000 Years." In an interview on CBS's "Face
the Nation," host Bob Schieffer asked McCain about staying in Iraq for
100 year. McCain responded, "We've got to get Americans off the front
line, have the Iraqis as part of the strategy, take over more and more
of the responsibilities. And then I don't think Americans are concerned
if we're there for 100 years or 1,000 years or 10,000 years. What they
care about is a sacrifice of our most precious treasure, and that's
American blood. So what I'm saying is look, if Americans are there in a
support role, but they're not taking casualties, that's fine. We're in
Kuwait now. As you well recall, we had a war, we stayed in Kuwait. We
didn't stay in Saudi Arabia. So it's going to be up to the relationship
between the Iraqi government and the United States of America." [CBS,
"Face the Nation," 1/06/08; emphasis added]

=20

McCain: "It Doesn't Matter...We Could Be There For A Hundred Years, For
All I Know."  During an interview with the editorial board of the
Detroit News, McCain was asked, "When should the United States leave
Iraq?"  McCain responded, "It doesn't matter. We're still in Kuwait
since the first Gulf War. If we can continue to show this progress, we
could be there for 100 years, for all I know, as long as Americans are
not dying. It's not a matter of American presence; it's a matter of
success so we can beat back this adversary. If we'd done what they
wanted us to do six months ago, al-Qaida would now be trumpeting to the
world that it defeated the United States of America." [Detroit News,
1/3/08,emphasis added]

=20

McCain: "We're Going To Be In This Struggle For The Rest of The
Century."  While speaking at a town hall meeting in Sun City Center,
Florida, McCain said, "I'd like to look you in the eye and tell you
there's not gonna be any more wars.  I'd like to look you in the eyes
and tell you that this terrible evil called radical Islamic extremism is
defeated.  I can't do that.  I've got to tell you that we're gonna be in
this struggle for the rest of this century because it's a transcendent
evil." [Town Hall Meeting; Sun City Center, FL 01/26/08; emphasis added]

=20

McCain: "We Are In A Greater Struggle That Is Going To Be With Us For
The Rest of This Century."  While giving a speech in Nashua, New
Hampshire, We are in two wars. We are in a greater struggle that is
going to be with us for the rest of this century... He added, "These
young people that are in this crowd, my friends, I'm going to be asking
you to serve. I'm gonna be asking you to step forward and serve this
nation in difficult times." [Speech in Nashua, New Hampshire, 1/7/08;
emphasis added]

=20

Mid 2008: "Not too important" when troops come home - No, wait, make it
"2013"=20

=20

=20

On NBC's "Today Show," John McCain said bringing American troops home
was "not too important."  In an interview on NBC's Today Show, host Matt
Lauer asked Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) about his support for the war in
Iraq. Noting that violence has decreased in Iraq, Lauer asked if McCain
has a better "estimate" of when he would withdraw troops from the
country. McCain responded: "No, but that's not too important. What's
important is the casualties in Iraq. Americans are in South Korea.
Americans are in Japan. American troops are in Germany. That's all fine.
[NBC's Today Show, 6/11/08]

=20

McCain: Iraq War will be won by 2013: "By January 2013, America has
welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed
terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom.  The Iraq war
has been won." [McCain Remarks, 5/15/08
