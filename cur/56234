*Blitzer Presses Blunt On Timetable For Withdrawal, McCain Position* (CNN
07/20/08)
WOLF BLITZER: The Iraqi prime minister, Nouri Al-Maliki, he said, he was
quoted as saying,'U.S. Presidential candidate Barack Obama talks about 16
months. That, we think, would be the right timeframe for a withdrawal, with
the possibility of slight changes.' Now later one of the spokesmen said
that's not exactly what he meant to say but it seemed to have pulled the ru=
g
out of John McCain, whose been a strong opponent of any timetable, the
President has been a strong opponent of any timetable. But now, the
democratically elected prime minister of Iraq seems to be siding with
Senator Obama. What do you make of this?

ROY BLUNT: Well you know what, what I think is most interesting about that
is that Americans think it matters what prime minister Maliki is saying
because a year ago they didn't. The policies we're pursuing now that have
stabilized this government that really are proving to the world it has a
future are a reason that these comments make any difference at all. If he'd
had said that a year ago, everybody'd say that government's not going to
last, doesn't matter what Maliki thinks. The very policies that have
stabilized that government make any comedy at least makes it meaningful.
Clearly the situation on the ground at the time should decide this, not som=
e
date-

BLITZER: Even the White House is now talking about some general time
horizon.

BLUNT: Sure and why not? That's exactly what we thought a year ago when
Barack Obama and Speaker Pelosi were opposing the policies that now let tha=
t
look like it might be able to happen with a stable Iraq. Iraq is central to
the problem we face in the middle east right now.

*How Will Maliki's Comments Affect McCain? *(MSNBC 0720/08 11:54am)
ALEX WITT: President Bush and Iraq's Prime Minister have agreed to a genera=
l
time horizon for brining home more US troops. But what impact is this going
to have on the upcoming presidential election? . . . Iraqi Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki was quoted in a German magazine . . . during which time he
said he supports Sen. Obama's 16-month timeline for withdrawal. Maliki late=
r
said that his statements were misunderstood. Does this apparent contrast
with the Bush administration message hurt John McCain at all?

AMANDA CARPENTER: I don't think it does because if you look at the
clarification, the intent of what Maliki was saying is that it would be
ideal to start removing troops a, a, as security conditions continue to
improve on the grown. And this is certainly to be credited with the work
John McCain has done because if you would've followed Obama's plan to
withdraw the troops prematurely . . . you would not have seen this improved
security situation . . .

[ . . .]

PETER DELL: . . . I don't have the slightest idea what John McCain's
position really is on Iraq is right now. This sort of Orwellian phrase,
"general time horizon," that's coming out of the White House similar to so
many other phrases that have very little meaning . . . Sen. Obama wants to
end the war, end it responsibly . . . Sen. McCain, I'm not really sure what
he wants to do. There's a very ill-defined, sort of open-ended position on
Iraq . . .

 [ . . . ]

CARPENTER:  . . . I think McCain's been very clear that he wants the troops
to leave once the I-I-Iraq is stabilized . . . so that we can leave on
victory, so that we're not creating a situation where mass genocide occurs
as soon as our troops leave . . .

*Can McCain Run on Change? Probably Not. *(NBC 07/20/08 10:02am)
CHRIS MATTHEWS: McCain, like everyone else on the planet, knows that people
are urging for something new. They want a change in American life generally=
.
Does he think he can sell real change, John McCain style?

DAN RATHER: Well obviously he does think he can sell it. The open question
is whether he can change the question from, "do we want a Bush III?" . . .
His thing is, "yes it's going to change whether you like it or not but  . .
=2E what kind of change do you want . . . ? Let's face it, it's a very toug=
h
sell for him.

[ . . . ]

KELLY O'DONNELL: . . . here's a great frustration not only with Sen. McCain
but the people around him that the change label has been so affixed to Obam=
a
=2E . . they're trying to use a different word. "Reform." The idea is that
McCain could go to Washington and knock heads . . . that's not quite as
jazzy as "Change you can believe in." He's trying to convey that he would b=
e
the guy that would go against the system because they say he has a record o=
f
that.

MATTHEWS: Why doesn't he go back to being that maverick? That real guy? The
Teddy Roosevelt Republican.

CYNTHIA TUCKER: I miss the John McCain that ran in 2000. When he really was
a maverick . . . that was the John McCain that so alienated hardcore social
conservative preachers.

MATTHEWS: No more of that stuff.

TUCKER:  . . . the lesson he took away is that that John McCain lost. Many
of the people he needs to vote for him, hardcore Republican voters are
suspicious of him . . . now he has tacked further to the right. Who does
that in a general election campaign? And, in addition to that, he's now got
a Karl Rove prot=E9g=E9 running his campaign. So it becomes harder and hard=
er
for him to run away from George Bush if he's going to use Karl Rove tactics
and back the very same policies that George Bus used in the White House for
eight years.

MATTHEWS:  . . . he's running as the change candidate and at the same time
he has to hew to the Bush line. He has to be more Bush than Bush. Doesn't
that put him out there as the third Bush term . . . ?

HOWARD FINEMAN: Sure. And that's exactly what the Obama campaign is doing .
=2E .

MATTHEWS: . . . we've never kept a party in power during a recession after
eight years. So how the heck does John McCain beat the system?

RATHER: That's one reason why the Obama people are convinced that  . . .
they'll win big . . .

[ . . .]

O'DONNELL:  . . . he's in a tough spot on both sides. He's fighting change,
he's fighting the White House reputation and he's trying to convey that he
is his own man. And that is hard to do.

MATTHEWS: They just wont go to the old school thing of saying, you know
what? Ok, we are mostly like Bush with a few racing stripes attached . . .
and go back to what the Democrats did in '64 against Barry Goldwater, what
the Bush senior people did against Dukakis. Just scare 'em.

[ . . . ]

MATTHEWS: Let's get back to John McCain . . . when people vote for John
McCain . . .will people be voting for him . . . or saying, hey, it's just
more Bush?

O'DONNELL: They certainly hope people will vote on his character. That he
has challenged his own party. That he is a patriot . . .

MATTHEWS: Dan, will he be able to sell himself as a new change? Something
different?

RATHER: No. If he is to win, he has to make the argument, the new guy is to=
o
dangerous.

[ . . .]

MATTHEWS: . . . they're going to end up having to run negative. They can't
run him as a positive change force for change.

FINEMAN: Not in the end. No.

*Rove's Influence May Hurt McCain Campaign *(NBC 07/20/08 10:16am)
CHRIS MATTHEWS: As we said, President Bush and John McCain have had a chill=
y
relationship, at best . . . with the President, some of his former staffers
are working hard to get their former rival elected . . .

KELLY O'DONNELL: Well the president would certainly ljike to continue that
idea  of offense as a party of foreign diplomacy. That is something that
John McCain talks about a lot . . . I think McCain has a slightly different
view of foreign policy than the president.

MATTHEWS: . . . Karl Rove is hovering over this campaign. Steve Schmidt, on=
e
of his favorite people, his associate is in there running that campaign. It
looks to me like they want to win.

DAN RATHER: They want to win and john McCain wants to win. Because he has
bought into the Rovian strategy for this next election and why wouldn't he?
=2E . . however that can cost him on the other side. Because on the one han=
d
he's trying to say you know what? I'm not Bush III. On the other hand, he's
having President Bush's operatives run the campaign for him.

[ . . . ]

MATTHEWS: I'm looking at Rove here, over this whole campaign . . .I wonder =
 if
the polarizing, partisan way that the Bush team put together their campaign
isn't going to hurt the McCain effort.

Eric Shawn Accuses Media Of Favoring Obama, Ignoring McCain's Trips to Iraq
(FNC 07/20/08)
ERIC SHAWN: Senator Barack Obama on his overseas trip to Afghanistan, Iraq
and Europe this morning. You know more than 200 journalists have applied to
go along with the three big nightly anchors from the networks a huge media
turnout. This week on America's newsroom Bill Hemmer asked McCain's nationa=
l
communications director what she thinks of the trip and the media blitz.

[play clip]
BILL HEMMER: Do you think there is a bias towards Senator Obama?
JILL HAZELBAKER: Well Senator Obama is visiting Iraq and Afghanistan. I
found it interesting that he released his plan for the way forward in Iraq
and Afghanistan prior to visiting the region or talking to any of the
commanders on the ground. Let's drop that this is a fact-finding trip and
call it what it is: the first of its kind campaign rally overseas. [end
clip]

SHAWN: Well is it? Joining us now is media critic Liz Trotta. So Liz has
McCain gotten the same royal media treatment that Barck Obama is getting
now?

LIZ TROTTA: Well you know this is interesting. First McCain's campaign said
it was an overseas campaign rally, then they denied it, and now apparently
they're sticking to the original version. That's not clear from when she
said that. But as Frank Rich said in the New York Times this morning, this
is a global lollapoloza, this is JFK returns to Europe, ala the original JF=
K
in 1963 when he went to the Berlin Wall. So this is tremendous hype. I thin=
k
the McCain campaign has a valid argument in saying there isn't equal time s=
o
to speak. In fact the Daily News ran a story yesterday saying that they had
formally asked the networks to give equal time to Senator McCain. So it'll
be interesting to see if that balance is maintained or not. In the last
three months, or I should say since June really, there have been 114 minute=
s
of campaign coverage on the three networks, that's for Obama, and 48 for
McCain. We also have had in the last three years, a dozen Time and Newsweek
covers on Obama. True, he's new, and he's a whirlwind, he's a big story, bu=
t
the idea of balance is a valid issue to discuss.

SHAWN: You know you talk about the 48 minutes versus the 100 and something,
more than double for Obama. But my interest is if McCain goes to Iraq, do
you think that the three network anchors and the 200 journalists would be
accompanying him? I mean he's been there -- according to Polick.com- 8 time=
s
so far. He was ridiculed for walking through the market place in 2007 and
hasn't been had this type of treatment.

TROTTA: Well I can't believe- and he has been there a lot let's face it, no=
t
always with great results. But, let's face it, three anchors are not going
to go along. There is a cheering sectin in the liberal media for Obama
whether one likes it or not it exists. And I can't see a case where Senator
McCain would go to Iraq and all three network anchors would be you know
waling along in step and trying to get their interviews. This morning as a
matter of fact, as early as today, Laura Logan from CBS latched the
exclusive interview, again excusive everyone's going to say exclusive on
their interviews, with Senator Obama. [...]

SHAWN: But at the same time, John McCain, their media operation didn't do
the same thing that Obama's been doing, by having all these folks go along
with them, and that makes it harder to cover him.

TROTTA: Well there are a few excuse stories out there that they were not
given the same kind of easy access Mr. McCain on his last three foreign
trips since march, but you know, even if you have to go on your own speec i=
f
you wanna cover it you wanna cover it. And I think the networks have decide=
d
he may well be the next President of the United States and he's the big
story now.

ALEX WITT: Meantime, new reaction from Barack Obama's presidential rival,
John McCain. The Arizona senator dished out some heave criticism in his
weekly radio address.

JOHN MCCAIN: My opponent, Senator Obama, Announced his strategy for
Afghanistan and Iraq before departing on a fact-finding mission that will
include visits to both those countries. Apparently, he's confident enough
that he won't find any facts that might change his opinion or alter his
strategy. Remarkable."

Trips to Iraq (FNC 07/20/08)</span><br><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">=
ERIC SHAWN: Senator Barack Obama on his overseas trip to
Afghanistan, Iraq and Europe this morning. You know more than 200 journalis=
ts
have applied to go along with the three big nightly anchors from the networ=
ks a
huge media turnout. This week on America&#39;s newsroom Bill Hemmer asked M=
cCain&#39;s
national communications director what she thinks of the trip and the media
blitz.</span><br><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">&nbsp;</span><br><span=

<span style=3D"font-family: Times;">JILL HAZELBAKER: Well Senator Obama is =
visiting Iraq and
Afghanistan. I found it interesting that he released his plan for the way
forward in Iraq and Afghanistan prior to visiting the region or talking to =
any
of the commanders on the ground. Let&#39;s drop that this is a fact-finding=
 trip
and call it what it is: the first of its kind campaign rally overseas. [end

style=3D"font-family: Times;">SHAWN: Well is it? Joining us now is media cr=
itic Liz Trotta. So
Liz has McCain gotten the same royal media treatment that Barck Obama is
getting now?</span><br><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">&nbsp;</span><br=
><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">LIZ TROTTA: Well you know this is inte=
resting. First McCain&#39;s
campaign said it was an overseas campaign rally, then they denied it, and n=
ow
apparently they&#39;re sticking to the original version. That&#39;s not cle=
ar from when
she said that. But as Frank Rich said in the New York Times this morning, t=
his
is a global lollapoloza, this is JFK returns to Europe, ala the original JF=
K in
1963 when he went to the Berlin Wall. So this is tremendous hype. I think t=
he
McCain campaign has a valid argument in saying there isn&#39;t equal time s=
o to
speak. In fact the Daily News ran a story yesterday saying that they had
formally asked the networks to give equal time to Senator McCain. So it&#39=
;ll be
interesting to see if that balance is maintained or not. In the last three
months, or I should say since June really, there have been 114 minutes of
campaign coverage on the three networks, that&#39;s for Obama, and 48 for M=
cCain.
We also have had in the last three years, a dozen Time and Newsweek covers =
on
Obama. True, he&#39;s new, and he&#39;s a whirlwind, he&#39;s a big story, =
but the idea of
balance is a valid issue to discuss.</span><br><span style=3D"font-family: =
Times;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">SHAWN: You kno=
w you talk about the 48 minutes versus the 100 and
something, more than double for Obama. But my interest is if McCain goes to
Iraq, do you think that the three network anchors and the 200 journalists w=
ould
be accompanying him? I mean he&#39;s been there -- according to Polick.com-=
 8 times
so far. He was ridiculed for walking through the market place in 2007 and
hasn&#39;t been had this type of treatment.</span><br><span style=3D"font-f=
amily: Times;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">TROTTA:=
 Well I can&#39;t believe- and he has been there a lot let&#39;s
face it, not always with great results. But, let&#39;s face it, three ancho=
rs are
not going to go along. There is a cheering sectin in the liberal media for
Obama whether one likes it or not it exists. And I can&#39;t see a case whe=
re
Senator McCain would go to Iraq and all three network anchors would be you =
know
waling along in step and trying to get their interviews. This morning as a
matter of fact, as early as today, Laura Logan from CBS latched the exclusi=
ve interview,
again excusive everyone&#39;s going to say exclusive on their interviews, w=
ith
Senator Obama. [...]</span><br><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">&nbsp;</=
span><br><span style=3D"font-family: Times;">SHAWN: But at the same time, J=
ohn McCain, their media operation
didn&#39;t do the same thing that Obama&#39;s been doing, by having all the=
