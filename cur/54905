Dear John,

I know you've been inundated with fundraising emails lately, but this time, I wanted to email you just to thank you and let you know what your support has meant to me and to candidates all over the country.

As of this weekend, thanks to the generosity of supporters like you, we've raised more than $1 million for female Democratic candidates across the U.S.

I hope you'll check out this article in Buzzfeed about the incredible feat you've helped make happen.

[ http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/gillibrand-raises-money-for-women-and-builds-a-po ]

As I say in the article, "When we're electing fewer women, we're moving in the wrong direction." Thank you for all your help to ensure we move toward a country with more women in elected office and a country where the outcomes are better for everyone.

Sincerely,

Kirsten
