Dear All,



The First meeting of the Law and Humanities Faculty Seminar, led by our Dis=
tinguished Visitor Professor Peter Brooks, of Princeton and Yale, will be h=
eld next Wednesday, February 4th, at 3:30, in McDonough 588.

The reading for the first meeting will be Sigmund Freud, Three Case Histori=
es, The Wolf Man.  We have ordered several copies of the book, and they sho=
uld be available at the beginning of next week from Roger Bourcicot, the AA=
 in Hotung, on the 6th floor.  We will let you know when they arrive.  In c=
ase time gets short, however, and they have not arrived, or if you want to =
read the material before that time, the book can be ordered online from Ama=
zon, for 11.00 new and 5.00 used, as well as direct to your Kindle.  The li=
nk is:

http://www.amazon.com/Three-Case-Histories-Sigmund-Freud/dp/0684829452/ref=
=3Dsr_1_1?s=3Dbooks.


Or, just go to amazon, the number is 9780684829456: Amazon.com: Books.

Or, Peter and I have a couple of xeroxed copies which we will be happy to l=
end out.

I hope you can make it!  If you have not already done so, let me know if yo=
u are planning or hoping to attend, so i can put together a master list of =
most-likely-attendees.

The seminar will meet four times over the course of the semester.


 Here is the general description:



The legal =93case=94 would seem to have affinities with the medical and psy=
choanalytic =93case history,=94 and perhaps also the use of specific cases =
by historians, or even writers of fiction.  What is a =93case-history=94?  =
What is intended by writing the history of a case?  How does it relate to t=
he cases presented in legal opinions, or to historical or fictional account=
s of problematic persons and situations?
In general, the case-history seems to make a claim to tell a story that is =
exemplary, that may set a precedent, from which others can learn something =
of further application.  What creates exemplarity in legal, historical and =
fictional discourses?  What kinds of reading do cases demand?  What sort of=
 =93application=94 do they ask for?  If a U.S. Supreme Court opinion typica=
lly ends: =93It is so ordered,=94 are there cognate imperatives in other ki=
nds of cases?
Benjamin Cardozo once claimed that from the =93sordid stories of litigants=
=94 would emerge the =93shining truths of the law=94: noble words, but both=
 the shining truths and the sordid stories, and perhaps especially the rela=
tion between them, would seem to merit discussion.

Possible texts might include (but many others available):
law:


Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad

Cooper v. Aaron

Miranda v. Arizona

Missouri v. Seibert

District of Columbia v. Heller


psychoanalysis:


Freud, From the History of an Infantile Neurosis (the =93Wolf Man=94)


history:


Natalie Davis, The Return of Martin Guerre

Carlo Ginzburg, =93Clues=94


Literature:


 Balzac, Adieu

Kafka, The Judgment, In the Penal Colony

Duras, The Ravishing of Lol Stein
