John- comms team would like to give Dan Merica an edited version of YOUR
quote in yesterday's gun hit on Sanders. NEW text highlighted in yellow.
Text that will stay consistent highlighted in green.

Dan is writing a story about Jeff Weaver and Sanders' camp hitting back at
the gun attacks. They are asking us to respond to this weaver quote:

*=E2=80=9CPeople will remember that Secretary Clinton has been all over the=
 map on
guns, she=E2=80=99s been very conservative on guns, she=E2=80=99s been very=
 liberal on
guns, people will remember the attacks she leveled against then-Sen. Barack
Obama, now President Barack Obama back in 2008 on guns, when she was
tacking to the right on this. So I think her argument would be much more
compelling if she had a consistent record on this issue."*

*"What is happening is you=E2=80=99re seeing the polls and and I think that=
 Clinton
campaign is getting very very nervous."*

*NEW QUOTE*

=E2=80=9CBetween Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, only one candidate has=
 a
consistent record fighting against the gun lobby to prevent gun violence.
Senator Sanders' record shows he is willing to hold most industries
accountable for their abuses, but not gun manufacturers and dealers. If
Senator Sanders wants to make good on his pledge to support commonsense gun
safety measures, he ought to commit to fully repealing the immunity he
voted to extend to the gun industry. The NRA said this was its biggest
priority in 20 years, and Senator Sanders still refuses to admit he got it
wrong.=E2=80=9D
