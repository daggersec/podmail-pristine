Good Afternoon,=0A =0AI am wanted to make sure you were aware of a study do=
ne that shows heavy airplane traffic contributes to even more pollution to =
the skies above Los Angeles than the city's congested freeways, cars and co=
rporates. I have included the article below, as well as a link to the artic=
le. Furthermore, studies show that "aviation accounts for about 11 percent =
of carbon dioxide pollution from the U.S. transportation sector and is one =
of the fastest growing sources of carbon pollution, rising three to five pe=
rcent a year."  The Environmental Protection Agency and Obama Administratio=
n has taken some incredible actions recently and I am very thankful that yo=
ur administration is working hard to protecting our country and community. =
=0A =0AI am hoping to see and urging the EPA to work on a solid action plan=
 to cut aircraft and aviation pollution as soon as possible. This is the ai=
r we all breath and pollution that affects us all and our future.=0A =0A =
