I can=E2=80=99t quite articulate this=E2=80=A6but having met with =
hundreds and hundreds of Virginia Tea Party folks for Warner, and having =
actually listened to them. . . I think there is something here:

Trump (and others?) have called for registering Muslims.    He has =
called for a federal domestic police force that will be focussed on =
arresting and deporting 11 million people.  Other candidates are talking =
about separating immigrants by religion.

All of this is about building up and feeding the BIG BROTHER beast.

The Tea Party was born bc of the perception of government encroachment =
in peoples lives =E2=80=94 and it really has always been the Rand Paul =
mantra:  government wants to control your health care decisions.  =
Government wants register all your guns, which will ultimately lead to =
gun confiscation.  Government wants the ability to murder its own =
citizens with drones (remember the Rand Paul filibuster on that one?).  =
The Snowden stuff confirmed what many felt. . .the government was =
collecting vast troves of information on everyone.

At a certain point, I think HRC might bring together all the different =
strands (mostly Trumps) of expanding federal Big Brother government =E2=80=
=94 and talk about how its possible to be safe without creating some =
kind of large and cumbersome and intrusive  police state. =20

This will sew divisions and acrimony o the other side.  But it may be =
too early to raise this.  Or maybe she SHOULD pick a fight with Trump on =
this to help cement his front runner status.   Luke=
