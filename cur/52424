Dear Friend,

Outside spending in Colorado has blanketed the airwaves with ads. Those =
ads are more than just a nuisance -- they're a disservice to our =
democracy. The post-Citizens United disclosure rules are damaging =
Coloradans' right to know who's trying to influence their votes.

All the smoke and mirrors of those ads have taken their toll. Polls in the =
Colorado Senate campaign have become extremely close -- that's the kind of =
movement you can expect when out of state and anonymous special interests =
spend $22 million on a single race. And we can expect this same barrage of =
special interest spending in our fight.

The only way to stand up to the special interests is with grassroots =
action. Help us stay strong by contributing $5.

Colorado has seen more than $22 million in spending from outside groups -- =
that's in addition to the money individual candidates are raising and =
spending. Our elections are in danger of turning into auctions, and that's =
simply not how a democracy is supposed to function.

Elections are supposed to be about who has the best ideas for Colorado =
families, not who has the wealthiest donors. The big-money outside groups =
have spent enormous amounts of money on this year's races. Time is running =
out for grassroots networks like ours to fight back.

Stand up to the special interests who are trying to buy the Senate. Chip =
in $5 toward our $35,OOO goal before it's too late.
