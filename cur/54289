We know what we believe. We know the stakes.

Now we need to win.

Here are two things you should do right away:

First: If you haven't voted already, make a plan for when you're going to =
the polls -- and confirm your polling place and hours. And know that as =
long as you're at your polling place before it closes, you'll be able to =
vote -- and that you can vote even if you aren't yet registered. Make sure =
everyone you know has this link to confirm their polling place, too:

http://www.barackobama.com/lookup

Second: We can't afford to step back and hope others will make the =
difference. So once you vote today, keep going. Get on the phone, get =
online -- all day long, there will be something you can do to help. It's =
all right here:

http://my.barackobama.com/Do-Something

We are capable of so much when we are all in this together.

Please come through today.

Thank you,

Barack
