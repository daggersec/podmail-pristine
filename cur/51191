John -=20

Allow me to introduce you to Hawaii State Representative Mark Takai.

Mark and I went to college together at the University of Hawaii and, like =
me, he served in the Middle East as part of the Army National Guard.

Now he's running for Congress in a competitive primary, and I'm standing =
with him because he offers two things we need more of in Congress:=C2=AD =
courage, and the ability to get things done.

Mark has a critical campaign finance deadline coming up this Monday at =
midnight, and your $10 contribution will ensure he has the resources to =
win.=20

http://action.votevets.org/mark-takai

It's essentially a two-way race pitting Mark against State Senator Donna =
Kim, who led the fight against marriage equality in Hawaii earlier this =
year.

The polls show Mark within the margin of error, but he's building the kind =
of grassroots campaign it takes to win elections in Hawaii.

Mark has fought for veterans throughout his entire career in the State =
House. He helped create the Hawaii Medal of Honor, the Veterans Court to =
connect veterans with the benefits they've earned, and coordinated the =
state's Military Appreciation Package for almost a decade.=20

I am proud to support him, and I hope you'll join me with a $10 to his =
campaign today.

http://action.votevets.org/mark-takai

Mark is a dear friend and a member of the VoteVets emerging leader =
program. Your support for his campaign means a lot to me.

Thank you for your contribution.
