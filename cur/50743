Hi John

I am positive that you are busy these days so am hopeful that you, Mary and
family managed a relaxing break over the holidays. We had a fabulous time
with our reunited family of six and covet those moments as always.

Phil and I are so excited that we will host you in our home in NJ on
February 24th!  We would be thrilled if you wanted to stay overnight as
well so please keep that in mind. While I assume you will be on your own,
we clearly would be delighted to have Mary as well so please pass on that
invitation from us?

Please let me know how I can be helpful to you and keep me posted on your
plans.

See you next month.

Tammy xoxo
