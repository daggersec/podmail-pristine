In the months and years ahead, we're going to accomplish amazing things =
together. No president has ever had the support of such a powerful =
grassroots movement, and Barack and Joe will need you to continue fighting =
alongside them.

But before we take the next step, we need to get our house in order.

The Democratic National Committee poured all of its resources into =
building our successful 50-state field program. And they played a crucial =
role in helping Barack win in unlikely states like North Carolina and =
Indiana. We even picked up an electoral vote in Nebraska.

The DNC took on considerable debt to make this happen.=20

Make a donation of $30 or more now to help the DNC pay for these efforts, =
and you'll get a commemorative 2008 Victory T-shirt:

https://donate.barackobama.com/victoryshirt1

The DNC began building a 50-state organization in 2005.

The infrastructure they put in place over the last four years opened up a =
new batch of battleground states where a Democratic nominee hadn't been =
competitive for a generation.=20

In the final few months, the DNC went above and beyond to expand our =
ground efforts and ensure victory.

We couldn't have won this election without their support.

As we start laying the groundwork for real change, we need to help the DNC =
recover the resources it took to win. Please make a donation today and get =
your 2008 Victory T-shirt:

https://donate.barackobama.com/victoryshirt1

This movement for change is just getting started, and we look forward to =
working with you to bring the change this country needs.

Thanks for everything you did to elect Barack and Joe,

Obama for America
