John --

I know your life is full -- with work, or school, or family -- and yet =
you=20
still find the time to help out when you can.

You may have a tight budget, but you give what you can afford.

A woman recently told the campaign her family skipped a pizza dinner=20
at their favorite place so that they could make a difference in this =
election.

That is the commitment that drives this campaign.

If you can support Barack with a donation today, please know it makes=20
a huge difference. If we win, it will be because of what you did at =
moments=20
like this:

https://donate.barackobama.com/Our-Week

Thanks,

Michelle

P.S. -- It meant a lot to me to speak with you and everyone else last =
night.=20
Thank you for everything you do.
