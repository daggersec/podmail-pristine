John, 

Last month, the House Energy & Commerce Committee took a huge
step towards jumpstarting our economy with clean energy jobs
when they passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of
2009 (ACES). Now, this legislation will be voted on as soon as
next week in the House. 

Passing this legislation will bring us closer than ever to truly
putting us on a path to a clean energy future. But, Big Oil is
doing everything in their power to derail this legislation. Will
you contact your Member of Congress to insist that this bill is
strengthened and passed? 

Click here to ask your Representative to strengthen and pass the
ACES bill today. http://action.lcv.org/campaign/aces_0609/6kk3b59zjn3d8w3?

This legislation will help both our economy and our planet by
helping to create millions of jobs, reducing our dependence on
oil, and cutting global warming pollution. To make sure the bill
creates even more clean energy jobs, we would also like to see
improvements in the bill that strengthen requirements and
increase investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency,
as well as preserve the Obama administration's ability to
regulate dangerous pollutants.

But, Big Oil and their cohorts in Congress are stopping at
nothing to keep us addicted to dirty energy. They are flooding
the halls of Congress with misinformation, and we must counter
their attacks. 

Please ask your Member of Congress to strengthen and pass this
critical legislation.
http://action.lcv.org/campaign/aces_0609/6kk3b59zjn3d8w3?

Passing ACES legislation would jumpstart a clean energy economy
by:

* Supporting the development of new clean energy sources, such
as wind, solar and geothermal, by requiring utilities to
generate at least 20% of their electricity from renewable
resources, with a portion met through efficiency by 2020;
* Dramatically boosting energy efficiency in building,
appliances, and homes, saving over $25 billion per year by
2030; and
* Reducing global warming pollution by at least 17% by 2020 and
83% by 2050.

Send a message to your representative today urging him or her to
defend, strengthen and pass the American Clean Energy and
Security Act (HR 2454).
http://action.lcv.org/campaign/aces_0609/6kk3b59zjn3d8w3?

We have a narrow window of time to move this legislation..
Please don't wait - email your Representative today. 

Thank you for all that you do,

Sincerely,

Gene Karpinski
