"Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or
patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our
common suffering into hope for the future." - Nelson Mandela

In this season of reflection and rebirth, let us recommit ourselves to
the founding principles of our nation.

Democracy is a deeply radical and beautifully inspiring idea.

It asserts that the dignity and voice of every individual matters,

that each one of us has a responsibility to build a common future for
all of us.

The practice of democracy requires empathy and compassion and
curiosity.
It requires faith in humanity's capacity to grow, learn, and evolve.

The practice of democracy requires each of us to call forth our best
self.
As we look toward the challenges of the new year,
let us dedicate ourselves anew to establishing a
government of the people that serves all of the American people
with vision, purpose, and clarity.

Wishing you strength, resolve, friendship, and joy in the New Year!
The Center for Effective Government
