McCain's Alternative Universe
**

Revised September 12, 2008
*

After running a nearly flawless race, the Obama campaign has made the
unforgivable error of allowing the Republicans to hold a convention.

This move gave Senator McCain's campaign the opening to thrust America into
an alternative universe where the 72 year old Republican who has been in
office for 25 years and votes with President Bush more than 90 percent of
the time is an "agent of change" and the son of the single mother on food
stamps is an "elitist."

In this alternative universe it's perfectly coherent to have speeches at th=
e
Republican convention on "small town values" by former New York City Mayor
Rudy Giuliani, on "eastern elites" by former Massachusetts Governor and
Harvard graduate Mitt Romney, and on creating "jobs at home" by Carly
Fiorina who laid off 20,000 workers as CEO of Hewlett Packard and used to
refer to offshoring American jobs as "rightshoring."

Today the McCain campaign released another ridiculous and hyperbolic
advertisement accusing the Obama campaign of sexist smears against Governor
Palin (*
http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/McCain_keeps_up_Palin_vic=
timhood_campaign.html?showall.
*<http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/McCain_keeps_up_Palin_v=
ictimhood_campaign.html?showall.>)
As evidence, the ad cites Obama senior advisor David Axelrod's observation
that Governor Palin "=85tried to attack Obama by saying he had no significa=
nt
legislative accomplishments =97 maybe that's what she was told=85.I think s=
he
had an assignment and she went out and she discharged it.'"

What is sexist about that? Suggesting that Governor Palin took direction
from the campaign rather than acting on her own accord? That is what runnin=
g
mates do. Or does the McCain campaign think that the simple use of the
pronoun "she" is somehow dismissive and sexist? I don't happen to find "she=
"
offensive, and the notion that the McCain campaign might reveals more about
their attitudes towards women than anyone else's.

The ad also cites Senator Biden's remark that Governor Palin was better
looking than him. For better or worse, Senator Biden seems compelled to
discuss the appearance of both tickets =96 with his comments on Senator
Obama's good looks and Senator Biden's own "drop-dead gorgeous" wife. I hav=
e
a lot of respect and admiration for Senator Biden, and know he is nothing
but well-intended in making these observations, but he should probably just
stop commenting on people's looks altogether.

So long as we are comparing notes on allegedly sexist comments, let's revie=
w
some of McCain's. As someone who worked in the Clinton White House, McCain'=
s
first overtures to Hillary voters called to my mind the incredibly tasteles=
s
and mean-spirited joke Senator McCain made in 1998 about then-18 year old
Chelsea Clinton. Of course he also famously chuckled earlier this year when
a supporter called Hillary an obscenity and has told more tacky jokes about
his wife then I care to get into. I don't know that these comments make Joh=
n
McCain a sexist. But they sure make his campaign's charges of sexist smears
by Obama laughable.

Bringing up policy violates a central tenet of the alternative universe, bu=
t
I should also note that Senator McCain opposes equal pay legislation and hi=
s
health care plan would erode important state protections which guarantee
women's access to some of our most basic health needs.

Prior to 2004 McCain had seemingly wrestled with the question of whether it
was best to make his way to the Oval Office as a maverick who bucks his
party, or as a committed friend to the right wing base. He clearly made the
decision in 2004 to forgo the maverick in favor of being a toady to the bas=
e
when he literally and figuratively hugged President Bush as part of his
re-election campaign.

In the alternative universe, McCain's pick of Palin heralds the return of
maverick. No way. The selection of Palin was an attempt to appease =96 not
buck =96 the base of the party. Joe Lieberman would have been the maverick
choice. I will grant you that the Palin pick was unpredictable, but is that
the quality people are really looking for in a president? And what does it
say about how John McCain makes decisions that when he could not go with hi=
s
first selection of the moderate, seasoned, pro-choice candidate his reactio=
n
was to go to the other extreme with a base conservative who has been in the
statehouse for twenty months and he met once?

Back in the real universe unemployment hit a five year high last week, gas
is $4 a gallon, families' wages have dropped an average of $2000, we are
fighting two wars, spending $10 billion month in Iraq, and in the midst of
major housing crisis.

Also back in the real universe a man named George Bush is President of the
United States and John McCain is a man who has been in the US Senate for a
quarter of a century, votes with Bush 90 percent of the time, would not onl=
y
continue Bush's tax cuts but lob on an extra $200 billion a year in new tax
cuts for corporations, would exclude 100 million middle class families from
getting any sort of tax relief, and dismantle the employer-based health car=
e
system.

Meanwhile, Senator Obama is talking specifics about how he would bring abou=
t
change with a middle class tax cut that would go to 95 percent of America's
families, education reform, 5 million new green collar jobs, $1000 tax cut
to deal with energy costs and of course ending the war in Iraq.

Over the course of the past week, many Democrats have thrown themselves int=
o
their own universe of dread and self-doubt. I would remind my friends livin=
g
in that dark place that just a week ago commentators were openly speculatin=
g
on television as to when McCain was going to have to drop Palin from the
ticket and now she is supposedly catapulting him to the Oval Office. A
little perspective is in order.

Put me down as one willing to bet that come November voters in this univers=
e
are going to look more favorably on the candidate talking about solutions
than the one talking about lipstick.
