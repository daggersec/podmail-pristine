Senator Jim Webb, Secretary Bill Perry and Secretary Richard Danzig all =
are firmly behind John Douglass. you know he is what we need. But, John =
needs your help urgently. He has his get out the vote budget deadline =
tonight at midnight and still needs $5,263 to hit his goal. Think of it as =
an investment in your future.

Donate now and make sure John gets out the vote to win on November 6th.

Thank you for all of your support.

Keep up the fight.
