Dear Georgetown Law Center Community:

It is with sadness but also profound gratitude that I write to share some n=
ews with the Georgetown University Law Center community.

After a period of prayerful discernment and with the help of his bishop and=
 spiritual director, our Protestant chaplain, Rev. Kevin Wright, has decide=
d to accept a position as the Director of Christian Education at the Rivers=
ide Church in Manhattan.  The Riverside Church is a great and historic cong=
regation with a rich tradition of inclusion and outreach and Rev. Wright fe=
els that God is inviting him to this new opportunity for ministry.

Though I was very sad when Kevin told me of his decision, it seemed clear t=
o me that he had made a mature discernment and that God was indeed calling =
him to this new opportunity to serve.  As sad as I am to see him go I can=
=92t help but feel excited for him and for the good work he=92ll do.

As so many of you in the community know Kevin has been a huge asset to our =
office and our Law Center community.  His passion and creativity have broug=
ht us exciting new programs like the =93Faith and Justice Conversations=94 =
and the =93What Matters and Why=94 series.  His knowledge of the Washington=
 community and background in community organizing have greatly enriched our=
 commitment to social justice and our efforts to connect students with the =
needs of people in the Washington area.  He has also reached out to many di=
fferent communities within the Law Center showing himself to be a trusted f=
riend, colleague, mentor and pastor.

More impressive, however, than what Kevin does is who Kevin is.  He is a ma=
n of faith and deep prayer who exudes peace and gospel joy.  I cannot think=
 of a time when he has not had an encouraging word and a comforting smile. =
 His warmth and compassion are combined with a deep theological formation. =
 Our office has benefited greatly from his profound knowledge of the Christ=
ian tradition.

There is much more that I could say, but there will be other opportunities =
to express our gratitude for all that Rev. Wright has brought to the Law Ce=
nter.  Kevin will leave us  February 13th.  We will have a party in his hon=
or, but are still working out the details.  We=92ll let you all know as soo=
n as we know more.

Though we have not finalized plans, we expect to form a search committee fo=
r Kevin=92s successor.
We will do our best meanwhile to continue his good work and to serve the ne=
eds of our Protestant students.

Please join me in wishing Kevin well and praying for God=92s blessings on h=
is new work!

Sincerely,

Fr. Paul Rourke, S.J.
Director
Georgetown Law Center Campus Ministry
