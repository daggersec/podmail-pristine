John, at one point after Kevin's email below, grassroots donations were pou=
ring in at more than ten donations *per minute*!

We need to show America that Democrats won't back down in the face of tacti=
cs like these recalls =E2=80=93 can you help keep the momentum going with a=
 donation of just $5 or $10? <https://secure.dlccweb.com/o/6377/p/salsa/don=

John --

The clock has officially started: recalls against two Colorado Democrats ar=
e now set for September 10th.

That leaves Democrats a little more than six weeks make their case to voter=
s and fight through hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of attacks from =
Republicans and the gun lobby. But if we raise $50,000 in the next ten days=
, we can begin our rapid-response plan early in critical swing districts li=
ke these across the country.

Please rush $10 or more to defend Democrats like Angela Giron, John Morse, =
and others across the country who are being attacked for supporting backgro=
und checks! <https://secure.dlccweb.com/o/6377/p/salsa/donation/common/publ=
ic/?donate_page_KEY=3D7387&Email=3Djohn.podesta@gmail.com>

State Sens. John Morse and Angela Giron are being recalled for the supposed=
 "malfeasance" of making their communities safer by requiring background ch=
ecks for all gun sales =E2=80=93 an idea supported by more than 90% of Amer=
icans and 80% of Coloradans.

But now that these recalls are moving forward, we have a chance to prove th=
at Democrats across the country won't be intimidated by an extreme minority=
 who oppose background checks in all instances.

Help us raise $50,000 by the end of the month to defend Democrats like Sens=
. Morse and Giron who've come under attack across the country =E2=80=93 ple=
ase rush $10 or more today! <https://secure.dlccweb.com/o/6377/p/salsa/dona=
tion/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=3D7387&Email=3Djohn.podesta@gmail.com>

Stopping recalls like these is one of the most important priorities for Dem=
ocrats all over America who believe in commonsense gun safety. Thank you fo=
r making a difference in that fight. <https://secure.dlccweb.com/o/6377/p/s=
