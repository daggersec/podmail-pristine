In my regular life, I have a fellowship paid for by Atlantic
Philanthropies/Gara LaMarche,and am an adviser to Gara on politics in
general. Gara has been organizing a consortium of money people and
groups with lots of resources for occasional mtgs re how to be helpful
in getting the Obama agenda passed. Gara believes that this group can
put together some fairly serious resources in fairly short order. (From
what I understand, in the early days of these discussions, John, you had
some involvement in the conversations.) Gara has organized a mtg of this
group in Chicago for this Sun, and is planning on inviting John, and has
invited me as well.
Questions:
=20
1. Do you see any problems with me going?
2. Do either of you want to go?
3. It seems like it would be a good thing for there to be an internal
mtg with the Obama folks who care the most about the how to organize the
outside advocacy piece before this mtg in Chicago on Sunday. Can we go
ahead and put that mtg together?
