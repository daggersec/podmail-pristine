Well....I talked to HRC and she said she did not know where that would have
come from. Said we have to get better but not this.  Asked me if I thought
it came from people on the call this am.   We both agreed that it was not
in their interest to do so.  She then offered that maybe it was donors.

I am telling press otr that it is not true, unfounded.  But honestly don't
know what I should say.

Subject: Fwd:POLITICO Breaking News: Clinton weighs staff shake-up after
New Hampshire

MANCHESTER, N.H. - Hillary and Bill Clinton are so dissatisfied with their
campaign's messaging and digital operations that they are considering
staffing and strategy changes after an expected loss in Tuesday's primary
here, according to a half-dozen people with direct knowledge of the
situation.

The Clintons - stung by her narrow victory in Iowa and the overwhelming
support under-50 voters - had been planning to reassess staffing at the
campaign's Brooklyn headquarters after the first four primaries, but they
have become increasingly caustic in their criticism of aides and demanded
the reassessment sooner, one source told POLITICO.

"The Clintons are not happy, and have been letting all of us know that,"
said a Democratic official who speaks regularly to both. "The idea is that
we need a more forward-looking message, for the primary - but also for the
general election too ... There's no sense of panic, but there is an urgency
to fix these problems right now."
