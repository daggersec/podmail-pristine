WhyAny Deal to Cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid Would be a Moral,E=
conomic and Political Disaster
=20
     Friday, theDemocratic group Third Way published a memo arguing that De=
mocrats shouldsupport =93entitlement reform=94 =96 by which they mean cuts =
in Social Security,Medicare and Medicaid.  I don=92t doubt thesincerity or =
intentions of their proposal, but I believe that if Democrats tooktheir adv=
ice it would result in a moral, economic and political disaster.=20
=20
     Here=92s why:
=20
     The immorality of =93entitlement reform.=94  The very idea that senior=
s on Social Security=96 whose average income is $18,000 a year =96 should b=
e asked to tighten theirbelts while the Federal Government still gives huge=
 tax breaks to millionairesand subsidies to oil companies is just plain wro=
ng.=20
=20
      The principlevoices for =93entitlement reform=94 are the multi-millio=
naires from Wall Street whoargue that we need to cut Social Security and Me=
dicare benefits as part of abargain to reduce the long-term federal deficit=
 and give the =93markets=94confidence.  Never mind that SocialSecurity in p=
articular does not contribute anything to the deficit and has infact genera=
ted a $2.6 trillion surplus that was paid for by workersand employers throu=
gh Social Security taxes. Nevermind that the Wall Street gang clamoring for=
 =93entitlement reform=94 demandedextension of the Bush tax cuts for the we=
althy, subsidies for the oilcompanies, tax breaks for companies that send j=
obs overseas and an end to theestate tax that only affects the sons and dau=
ghters of multi-millionaires.
=20
     Never mind thatmany of those who promote =93entitlement reform=94 rake=
 in millions from the fruitsof their coupon clipping and are taxed only 15%=
 -- while ordinary middle classpeople pay twice that much on income earned =
by actually working for a living.=20
=20
     Last year JohnPaulson madea record $5 billion in personal income as th=
e manager of a hedge fund. Had hesomehow managed to make that astronomical =
sum of money laying bricks orsweeping floors, he would have paid taxes at a=
 rate of 35% on the bulk of hisincome.  Instead, he paid at a rate ofonly 1=
5%, since he earned his money by speculating as a hedge fund managerinstead=
 of making a useful good or service.=20
=20
     The averageSocial Security benefit paid to a retiree is $14,000 per ye=
ar.  John Paulson =96 who received a multi-billiondollar tax break compared=
 to ordinary working Americans -- made as much lastyear as the total paid t=
o 357,142 average Social Security beneficiaries.   And we=92re asking Socia=
l Securitybeneficiaries to =93tighten their belts=94? That=92s just plain w=
rong.
=20
     By the way, aFederal report issued at the end of last week found that =
corporations made morein profits in the last quarter of 2010 than at any ot=
her time in the history ofthe United States.  That, of course, wasfar from =
the case for middle class incomes.
=20
     For the lasttwenty years, middle class incomes have stagnated at the s=
ame time all of ourvery considerable increase in Gross Domestic Product has=
 gone to the top 2% ofthe population.  Middle class peopleshouldn=92t be as=
ked to pay to fix the fiscal mess that was caused by massive taxcuts to the=
 rich, two Republican wars and the collapse of the financial marketscaused =
by the recklessness of the big Wall Street banks. The middle class hassuffe=
red enough from the Republican policies designed by their friends on WallSt=
reet.  Those who had the party shouldbe asked to pay the bill.  The notiont=
hat middle class people =96 and those who aspire to the middle class =96 sh=
ould beasked to sacrifice while the wealthy few are getting richer and rich=
er issimply obscene.
=20
     =93Entitlement Reform=94 is bad economics. Theprinciple long-term stru=
ctural problem in the U.S. economy is the demise of themiddle class.  Long-=
term economic growthrequires that the incomes of ordinary Americans increas=
e in proportion to theincreased productivity of the economy. Otherwise, con=
sumers will not have enough money to buy the goods andservices produced by =
the economy and the result will, once again, be economiccollapse.  That =93=
demand deficit=94 isprecisely what caused the Great Recession.=20
=20
      Middle classwages over the last two decades did not keep pace with in=
creases inproductivity.  Every dime of growth inthe GDP was siphoned off to=
 the financial sector and the wealthy.  For a time, this demand deficit was=
 filledwith a credit bubble.  But when thatbubble ultimately burst, the hou=
se of cards came tumbling down.=20
=20
      Long-termeconomic growth requires that prosperity be widely shared. A=
nd that is not theleast bit inconsistent with the need to close a long-term=
 structural Federaldeficit.
=20
     My wife,Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, who served on President Obama=92=
s FiscalCommission, proposed a comprehensive plan to bring the deficit into=
 primarybalance without asking the middle class to pay by cutting Social Se=
curity,Medicare or Medicaid. Instead, deficit reduction is achieved by rais=
ing taxeson the wealthy; requiring those who make their income from investm=
ents to paythe same tax rate as those who make their money by working; cont=
rolling thecosts of health care with a Public Option; requiring Medicare to=
 negotiate withthe pharmaceutical companies for lower drug prices; making m=
odest cuts in militaryspending; and eliminating many tax expenditures to sp=
ecial interests such assubsidies to the big oil companies.=20
=20
     More recently shehas also proposed creating new tax rates for milliona=
ires andbillionaires.  At the moment the top taxrate is for all income abov=
e $375,000. The tax code currently makes no distinction between upper middl=
e classand our nation=92s economic royalty that makes millions.  Jan=92s pr=
oposal would create five new bracketsbeginning at one million and topping o=
ut at a billion. =20
=20
      If it wereimplemented this year, it would raise $78 billion =96 more =
than the $61 billionreduction sought by the Republicans.  Andit would do th=
is while assuring that the highest rate (for billionaires) isstill below th=
e highest tax rate under Ronald Reagan.=20
=20
     Those who wringtheir hands about the long-term budget deficit act as i=
f the deficit problem isintractable, and conveniently forget that only a de=
cade ago President Clintonleft office with federal surpluses as far as the =
eye could see.  Those surpluses were squandered away byGeorge Bush and the =
Republicans on two wars, and tax breaks for the wealthy.=20
=20
     The question isnot how to reduce the deficit, it is who pays to reduce=
 the deficit.=20
=20
     And the =93whopays=94 question is not just a question of morality, it =
is a question ofeconomics. Economic inequality in the United States is high=
er today than at anytime since 1928 =96 before the last great economic coll=
apse.  The last thing our economy needs is a =93deficitdeal=94 that shifts =
even more income and buying power away from ordinary middleclass Americans =
and into the hands of the wealthy.  That would be a formula for economicsta=
gnation and decline.  And that wouldbe precisely the effect of cutting Soci=
al Security, Medicare or Medicaidbenefits.=20
=20
       From aneconomic point of view, the facts are clear. We can cut the F=
ederal budget deficit without increasing the =93demanddeficit=94 by cutting=
 the incomes of retirees, the disabled and lower incomeworking people.=20
=20
     And let=92s beclear, all of the proposals for =93entitlement reform=94=
 would, in fact, cut theincomes of ordinary Americans.  Let=92slook at a fe=
w:
=20
=B7     Raising the Social Security retirementage to 70 for future retirees=
.  Thisproposal would amount to an effective cut of about 20% in average So=
cialSecurity benefits received by future retirees. Some people say that sin=
ce lifeexpectancy is increasing we should raise the age of retirement.  Tha=
t=92s easy to say if you=92re a lawyer orstock-broker =96 not so easy if yo=
u=92re a bricklayer or a maid who flips beds fora living. By the way, the n=
umbers show that life expectancy has increasedmainly for high-income people=
.
=20
=B7     Privatizing Social Security.  This proposal =96 which was soundly d=
efeatedwhen George Bush proposed it in 2005 =96 has been resurrected by the=
Republicans.  It would destroy SocialSecurity as we know it and replace it =
with a risky investment scheme thatturned over the Social Security Trust Fu=
nd to Wall Street. Of course gettingtheir hands on the Social Security Trus=
t fund is the major reasons why =93privatization=94is promoted by the same =
=93masters of the universe=94 whose reckless speculationcollapsed the econo=
my and cost 8 million Americans their jobs.  It would trade the guaranteed =
benefit ofSocial Security for a bet on the stock market. If you happened to=
 retire when the stock market lost 45% as it did in2008, you=92re just out =
of luck.
=20
=B7     Replacing Medicare with a =93voucher=94system. This is one of the m=
ajor elements of Republican Budget Chairman PaulRyan=92s =93Road Map.=94 Th=
e idea here is to give seniors a fixed value voucher andtell them to go sho=
p the private insurance market.  If private insurance companies raised rate=
s,then seniors would have to come up with the difference.  Instead of being=
 a health insurance plan thatseniors can count on to cover their needs like=
 Medicare, it would become a=93defined contribution=94 plan where the Medic=
are Trust fund would make a fixedcontribution to your health insurance cost=
s without any guarantee that youcould find a plan comparable to traditional=
 Medicare.
=20
This proposal is supposed to be a wayto =93control=94 health care costs.  O=
fcourse it does nothing of the sort. Instead, it controls federal expenditu=
res on health care by shiftingincreases in costs to seniors.  This isnot co=
st control =96 it is cost shifting. In fact, it would increase overallexpen=
ditures on health care in the economy by replacing the most efficientinsura=
nce system in existence =96 traditional Medicare =96 with private insurance=
companies that have massively higher administrative costs =96 plus take a p=
rofit.  And we=92re not talking about small differencesin overhead.  Medica=
re spends about 2% ofevery health care dollar on administration. Private in=
surers spend from 15% to 30% -- or more =96 of every dollar onadministratio=
n and other non-medical costs like marketing and profit.  =20
=20
In fact, a General Accounting Officereport found that in 2006, Medicare Adv=
antage plans =96 the part of Medicare thatalready involves private insuranc=
e plans -- spent only 83.3 percent of theirrevenue on medical expenses, wit=
h 10.1 percent going to non-medical expensesand 6.6 percent to profits. Tha=
t=92s 16.7 percent administrative share comparedto 2% for the traditional M=
edicare that does not involve private insurancecompanies.=20
=20
The bottom line is simple: replacingMedicare with vouchers for private insu=
rance would shift costs to seniors andincrease overall costs by allowing pr=
ivate insurance companies to take a chunkof every dollar without adding any=
 value whatsoever.
=20
=B7     Turning Medicaid into a block grant tothe states.  In this case, th=
e plan wouldbe to control federal outlays on health care for low-income Ame=
ricans =96 andnursing homes for the seniors and disabled -- by shifting the=
 burden to thestates.  The states could then either anteup more cash when h=
ealth care costs rose =96 or they could simply cut benefitsand shift costs =
to low-income working people. If the states came up with the additional mon=
ey, a higher percentagewould be coming from middle class Americans, since m=
ost state tax systems relyon sources that are less progressive than the Fed=
eral income tax.  If they chose to simply cut benefits, theburden would als=
o fall squarely on ordinary Americans.  =20
=20
A group that would be especially hardhit would be middle class seniors who =
need nursing home care, since a third ofMedicaid dollars goes to pay for lo=
ng-term care.  Much of that burden would ultimately fall ontheir children a=
nd families, who would be forced to come up with the money or watchtheir lo=
ved one be thrown out of the nursing home.=20
=20
And once again, the plan to turnMedicaid into a block grant would do absolu=
tely nothing to control health carecosts.  It would only shift those costst=
o everyday Americans and go a long way to undo the expansion of coverage to=
millions under the new Affordable Care Act.
=20
     Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid arethree crucial progressive ac=
hievements that have marked major mileposts alongAmerica=92s journey to rea=
lize our core values. Democrats have to be clear: we won=92t go back.
=20
     =93Entitlement Reform=94 would spell politicaldisaster for Democrats. =
The Third Way memo argues that next year=92s electionwill be about =93defic=
its.=94  That=92s justnon-sense.
=20
     First, a recentCBS News poll found that 51% of Americans say the econo=
my and jobs are the mostimportant problem facing our country today =96 but =
just 7% cited the budgetdeficit.
=20
     But morefundamentally, elections are never =93about issues.=94  Swing =
voters make their decisions based ontheir evaluations of the qualities of t=
he competing candidates. People voteabout whether a candidate is on their s=
ide, strongly committed to core values,a strong effective leader, self-conf=
ident, respectful =96 whether she or heinspires them. =20
=20
      Issues oftenbecome symbols in the voters=92 minds of whether a candid=
ate is =93on their side=94or =93a strong effective leader.=94  Butelections=
 are never =93about=94 an issue. They are about candidates.
=20
      Last yearDemocrats were thrown out of office because people were sick=
 of an economy thathad become worse and worse for them. As a consequence, m=
any swing votersdecided that Democrats weren=92t on their side.  If the eco=
nomy had been roaring back from recession, they would havevoted differently=
.  Their positions ondeficits, or Federal spending, would have made very li=
ttle difference becausethey are abstractions that have no direct, palpable =
impact on individual votersor their families.=20
=20
      On the otherhand if a voter becomes convinced that a candidate actual=
ly intends to takesomething away that they value =96 to cut their Social Se=
curity or Medicarebenefits, for instance =96 they will decide in a nano-sec=
ond that the candidateadvocating that position is not on their side.   That=
 is particularly true because mostAmericans believe that they are owed thei=
r Social Security and Medicare benefitssince they have paid throughout thei=
r working lives into Social Security andMedicare.  Voters don=92t view Soci=
alSecurity and Medicare just as =93government programs.=94  They view them =
as =93insurance programs.=94  Americans believe they deserve Social Securit=
yand Medicare benefits just as they would the benefits owed under any other=
insurance contract.
=20
     The notion thatindependent voters will some how be swayed by an abstra=
ction like a =93deficitdeal=94 is a fantasy that must have been dreamed up =
by folks who spend all oftheir time talking to other policy wonks inside th=
e beltway =96 certainly notsomeone who has experience with real world elect=
oral politics.=20
=20
     The Third Waymemo argues that seniors rarely break for Democrats anywa=
y.  Precisely. President Obama won in 2008 while losing seniors by eight po=
ints.  Last fall, Democrats lost seniors by 21points.  The President can wi=
nre-election while losing seniors by 8 points =96 but not by 21.  The elect=
ion passes through states with oldpopulations =96 like Pennsylvania, Ohio, =
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Florida.=20
=20
      A decent chunkof seniors who voted against Democrats last year have t=
o be convinced thatDemocratic candidates are on their side in 2012, or Demo=
crats are toast.  If they see Democrats bargain away theirSocial Security, =
Medicare and Medicaid benefits =96 or those of their kids =96 theywon=92t v=
ote Democratic in November of 2012. It=92s that simple.=20
=20
      The pollingshows clearly that the voters oppose cuts in in Social Sec=
urity, Medicare andMedicaid.=20
=20
=B7      The public opposes cutting Social Security benefits by 70% to 80%.=
=20
=B7     Two-thirds of likely voters oppose raising the retirement age.
=B7     Up to two-thirds support making the Social Security Trust fund solv=
ent forgenerations by raising the payroll tax to cover income above $107,00=
0 a year.=20
    =20
     A memo last weekfrom Democracy Corps summarized the findings of a surv=
ey they conducted in 50of the most competitive Republican-held Congressiona=
l districts =96 nearly all ofwhich gave a majority to Obama in the last pre=
sidential election. =20
=20
     In November,Republicans won these districts by 11 points. Now, as they=
=92ve got to know them in practice, their lead has shrunk totwo =96 a loss =
of 9 points. =20
=20
     Under 40 percentof the electorate in these districts sees their incumb=
ents as =93on their side.=94
=20
     Democracy Corpsreports, the more these voters learn of the Republican =

s in these Republican districts support the GOP plan to cut $61billion, and=
 by 48 to 40 percent, voters there say they are less likely tosupport the i=
ncumbent if the incumbent backs the Tea Party agenda. =20

     Another pollfound that 37% of Americans agreed with Democrats=92 appro=
ach to cutting spendingas opposed to 25% for Republicans.=20
=20
     One of thereasons is that as Americans have begun to look at Republica=
n budget proposalsup close =96 in the concrete, not the abstract.  They don=
=92t like what they see.  That=92s especially true when they hear thatRepub=
licans want to cut things that are important to them, at the same timethey =
give tax cuts to the rich, or subsidies to oil companies.  To voters this m=
eans that the problem isn=92tthat we=92re =93broke=94 =96 as House Speaker =
Boehner claims =96 but rather that the Republicansgive priority to the weal=
thy and big corporations instead of their needs.=20
=20
     Contrary to muchinside-the-beltway opinion, a recent NBC/WallStreet Jo=
urnal poll showed that a 51% to 46% majority says the governmentshould do m=
ore, rather than less.=20
=20
    It found that by54% to 18%, Americans do not believe that cuts in Medic=
are are necessary toreduce the deficit. Forty-nine to twenty-two percent sa=
y cuts in SocialSecurity are not needed.  Fifty-sixpercent say cuts in Head=
start programs are =93mostly=94 or =93totallyunacceptable.=94   Seventy-sev=
en percentsay the same of cuts in primary and secondary education. Majoriti=
es also callunacceptable cuts to defense, unemployment insurance, student l=
oans, and heatingassistance to low-income families.
=20
     On the other hand, while Republicans railagainst increases in taxes =
=96 even for the rich -- a whopping 81% favor placinga surtax on people who=
 make more than a million dollars.  Sixty-eight percent want to end the Bus=
h taxcuts on those who make over $250,000.=20
=20
     Many =93deficithawks=94 argue that we have to =93get real=94 and =93ma=
ke the tough choices=94 to balancethe budget.  How about we really get real=
and deal with the deficit using the approaches supported by the Americanpeo=
ple: increasing taxes on millionaires, or cutting tax subsidies to speciali=
nterests like oil companies =96 not by cutting Social Security, Medicare an=
dMedicaid benefits.
=20
     Fortunately, alot of major Democrats get the picture. Today, Senate De=
mocratic Leader Harry Reid will hold a =93Back Off SocialSecurity=94 event =
at the Capitol with senior groups and a large group of his colleagues. =20
=20
      They realizethat any long term =93deal=94 with Republicans over entit=
lements this year wouldinevitably erode Social Security, Medicare and Medic=
aid benefits because itmust pass a House that is now dominated by the Tea P=
arty. That is simplyunacceptable.
=20
     Democratic acquiescence to any deal thatcuts in Social Security, Medic=
are and Medicaid would be a moral, economic andpolitical disaster.
=20
      The Democratic message on entitlementsshould be simple and clear: to =
paraphrase the late Charlton Heston =96 you willhave to take cuts in Social=
 Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits out of ourcold, dead hands.=20
