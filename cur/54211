John - 

 

Just tuck this in your UFO files for future reference. 

 

One of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified
flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program. 

 

I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web. While I was never
fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them as
the US prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On occasion, I
had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified
organization in El Segundo, CA. No one could get into the cafeteria without
TS/SCI clearances, so this was not  "lightweight group of gossipers." One of
these times, a member of that group was really excited - said they'd just
picked up Fastwalker (I assumed that same day).  He described how it entered
our atmosphere from "deep space" (origin actually unknown, of course, but
from the backside of the satellite) and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty
closely on its way to earth. Not only was it going very fast but it made a
30 degree course correction (turn) which means it did not have a ballistic
(free fall) reentry trajectory that a meteorite might have. So, it was under
some sort of control - although whether it was "manned" or just "robotic"
there's no way to tell.

 

Although its now 24 years later, one factoid makes me think the USAF is
still collecting information on these Fastwalkers.  Reading the current
official USAF "DSP Fact Sheet" there is this line near the end: In addition,
researchers at The Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions
of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future.

 

http://www.losangeles.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5323

 

Also, much of the information on this site is accurate although I do not
know the author or his sources:
http://ufodigest.com/shadowmag/extra/topsecret.html

 

Somewhere within that USAF program office is many year's worth of Fastwalker
data. If someone were to collect and analyze it, patterns will emerge that
provide information about the various types of craft and their destinations,
which would add substantiation to eyewitness claims on the ground about UFO
activity. Furthermore, it would be interesting to understand the dates of
these appearances - is there a certain time of the every year they swarm in
(which might indicate a resource mining operation) or might there be a
correlation  with major events on earth, (such as the detonation of the
first atomic bomb at White Sands in 1945 although no DSP's existed to
provide any info on that particular event)?  

 

Regards,

 

Bob Fish
