Dear Professors Leon and Podesta:

I was perusing the list of paper topics that you provided and was intrigued
by the last item on the list, about the creation of a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission about the War on Terror. I'm interested in
exploring this further as a paper topic, but wanted to check to see if this
was a topic that someone had already written about or that no one else was
planning on writing about it.

Thanks very much!

Sincerely,
Dave Wilkins
