John --

This week, two U.S. senators, a Democrat and a Republican with "A"=20
ratings from the NRA, introduced a bill to close loopholes in =
background=20
checks for all commercial gun sales.=20

Let that sink in for a minute. Millions of Americans have demanded =
action,=20
and Congress is listening.

Now that we've got legislation, the next step is passing it. And no =
surprise=20
here: Allies of the gun lobby are threatening to block a vote. You can =
be=20
damn sure they're going to do the same thing if the bill makes it to =
the=20
House, too.

OFA is taking the gun lobby head on. We won't stand by silently while=20
the families in Newtown, Aurora, and Tucson grieve. So many people=20
have worked tirelessly for congressional action.=20

We won't let Congress forget.

Chip in $5 or more today -- and let's get this done:
