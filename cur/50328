I'd like to suggest Jonathan Silver to Bill Daley for inclusion in the
economic process.  In the tech/govt reform group, the spot I had in mind
for Jonathan has faded (as we focus, we're increasingly thinking that
open government is the main initiative of reinventing govt 2.0).  Also,
there's some tension between Jonathan and Tom Wheeler (former partners),
and they both think they shouldn't be too close to each other in the
process.  Jonathan said he'd love to be involved in financial
institutions or other economic policy work.

I'll send his name to Bill unless you think otherwise.
