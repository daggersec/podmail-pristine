All - I just saw Sandy Berger.  He has a letter supporting TPA that has been=
 signed by all national security advisors, secdefs, and secstates (save Bake=
r and Kissinger).  The question is whether HRC will sign it.  He is going to=
 a meeting at the White House at 5 today to discuss the public campaign in f=
avor of TPA. =20

As an immediate step, I recommend that John or Robby get in touch with WH se=
nior staff to buy some time on this so we can determine the best course and l=
ay the groundwork for it. =20

I see two options: stay off the letter, or sign the letter with a few tweaks=
 and say that she supports TPA but will withhold judgment on TPP until she s=
ees what's in the final agreement. =20

There are obvious problems with both approaches.  Personally, I recommend th=
e latter approach because she is going to have to take a position on this in=
 any event and it is hard for me to see how she opposes TPA. We could constr=
uct some additional elements that she can advocate for to reflect her concer=
ns about trade deals and her commitment to stand up for workers/businesses (=
including on currency manipulation). =20

If John/Robby can buy a few days, we could discuss Thurs.  Otherwise, we may=
 need to get on a call sooner. =20
