Dear Colleagues,

I'm writing to you in my role as chair of the Career Services Committee for=
 the past several years.  I understand that some colleagues are not making =
class recordings available to our students who need to miss class because o=
f callback interviews with law firms about summer associate positions, or i=
nterviews in connection with making a final decision about accepting an off=
er.  All professors, of course, are entitled to run their classes as they s=
ee fit.  I thought, however, that I would provide some information about th=
e fall law firm interview process so that everyone is aware of the situatio=
n that our students face.

The summer associate program is the most significant source of eventual per=
manent employment for our graduating class, accounting for about half of th=
e jobs that annual graduates obtain.  Roughly half of our students obtain s=
ummer associate positions, and 97% or more have obtained offers of permanen=
t employment as a result of taking such positions.  Students must return to=
 school in mid-August to begin the interview process, and most must schedul=
e their callback interviews by the second week of September.  They then hav=
e 28 days from the date of an offer to make a final decision.  This means t=
hat in order to make an informed decision they have four weeks to arrange f=
or all callbacks and to receive and consider any additional offers.  Becaus=
e of the long-term consequences, we are encouraging students to make carefu=
lly informed and considered decisions about their choice of firm.  This oft=
en results in their scheduling several interviews in an effort to do so.  A=
s you know, all of this occurs against the backdrop of a challenging employ=
ment market, which only adds to the stress.

For several years I have taught a large fall semester class comprised mainl=
y of second-year students, many of whom are going through this process.  I =
ask students to let me know if they ever need to miss class for any reason,=
 including law firm interviews.  My experience is that students who need to=
 schedule interviews that conflict with my class have made a good faith eff=
ort to avoid doing so, and that they typically have little practical choice=
 in the matter.  I am quite comfortable letting these students obtain class=
 recordings.  I've found in fact that many of these students are among the =
most conscientious in the class, and that the large number of interviews th=
ey have reflects their sterling first-year performance.  My experience, the=
refore, is that students who must miss class because of interviews are quit=
e responsible and are not giving short shrift to their academic responsibil=
ities.

I hope that this information is helpful in determining your own policies re=
garding access to class recordings.

Thanks,
Mitt
