Hello Hillary,

As you put your team together, in my view the two best Colorado political
consultants are Mike Melansen and Alan Salazar. They both were architects
of Governor Hickenlooper's recent win, and have huge experience in U.S.
Senate and Governor's races, as well as supporting roles in Presidential
ones.

Also, you should meet Al Yates-African American, PhD in theoretical
physics, former President of Colorado State University, founder of the
Democracy Alliance, and ....the list goes on. He singlehandedly has in his
head the data analytics of the last ten years in Colorado (funded with huge
resources) including the explanation of why Mark Udall lost and John
Hickenlooper won. I always won Colorado because of him. I would like to
arrange a time with him and you/ and your team as we get started.

I know there are many good people in Colorado who would want to help, will
help, and are seeking roles or have had roles with you or the President in
the past.  The three I mention above have no agenda, are smart, humble and
effective. In my view, the team you put together in Colorado will be the
keystone of your victory here. So please be cautious and on target. I am
available to you or your team whenever you want.

All the best,

Ken Salazar

 My dear friend and colleague Hilary,

 I so enjoyed our meeting today. I am all in because I know you, believe in
you, and share your values.

 I will help you as much as I can. Specifically, I would offer to (1) host
your first fundraiser in Colorado at Hope's and my home (my Mom might even
make it if she can); (2) help identify the key elected leaders in Colorado
like Representative Crisanta Duran and Mayor Hancock of Denver and host a
meeting with you and them; (3) help identify the right political talent in
Colorado; and (4) help as needed across the nation.

 You are the best. Cesar Chavez prayed "give me the courage to serve others
because in service there is true life." You have done so in your words and
deeds and I look forward to your next chapter of service.

 All the best,

 Ken Salazar
