Juliana,
=20
Assume you get all these clips but I thought I'd just give you a heads up a=
bout the following story which is getting picked up in the mainstream press=
. John might want to be made aware that if anything should end up on his de=
sk, he should know that Stephen Bassett, Executive Director of the EPPAC, a=
nd his campaign have no association whatsoever with journalist Leslie Kean =
or CFi (Coalition for Freedom of
Information) or SCI FI Channel, and that, in fact, Bassett is a nutjob and =
troublemaker, and should be ignored.

Thanks much!

Larry
