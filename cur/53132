In the face of over-the-top and bombastic rhetoric from her opponent, =
Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth showed real courage supporting a =
diplomacy-first approach with Iran.

Things are going well for Tammy: she leads in the polls and is building a =
great organization. She could have taken the easy way out politically and =
sided with Senator Kirk to mitigate any electoral fallout.

But she didn't -- she demonstrated the kind of leadership we can all =
expect from her in the United States Senate. A Senator willing to put her =
country ahead of her campaign, and veterans and military families ahead of =
the billionaire backers funding the anti-deal effort.

Once again, Tammy Duckworth has earned our thanks, and our support.

In her defense of the deal, Congresswoman Duckworth put our troops front =
and center, urging caution that "a pre-emptive strike would be extremely =
costly to the United States in terms of resources, the most precious of =
which are our men and women in uniform."

Whether it's the Iran deal, or caring for veterans and expanding their =
benefits when they return from war, Tammy Duckworth puts us first. It's =
one of the reasons we're so proud to have supported her through the years.

She'll make a tremendous U.S. Senator. But only if we all stand together =
with her today.

All the best,
