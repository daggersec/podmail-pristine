Good here.

Good morning all -- here are revised bullets for this evening.  I think
they do everything we discussed.

Three things:

1. At the top, instead of writing out entire riffs that she knows backward
and forward from the stump, we just put in the main tent-pole sentences, to
leave the rest to her.  You'll see.

2.  The "right to rise" immigration hit is different -- take a look.

3.  Added a few sentences on the Voting Rights Act.

HRC is departing earlier than planned this morning so I'll have to send her
a revised version in the next 1.5 hours or so.  So please send me any edits
asap.  (If you miss this window, the event isn't until tonight so we'll
have time for important changes today.)

Thank you all for your invaluable guidance!
