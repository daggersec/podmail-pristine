Dear John,

Doubling down =E2=80=A6 and "running scared" =E2=80=A6 that's Congressman T=
oomey in a nutshell!

As the Delco Times, one of our state's leading newspapers, said "Judging fr=
om the negative direction in which Toomey has already taken his campaign, i=
t appears he does not have confidence in his own ability to beat Sestak in =
November."

Last week, Congressman Toomey (and two special-interest groups) tried to bl=
unt our upward momentum - - reflected in the Quinnipiac Poll that showed us=
 having made up 8 points in three months; the race tied; and Quinnipiac's p=
ollster concluding the Senate race was "wide open" - - by launching 7 decep=
tive, negative "attack ads" across the state.

We asked for your help to respond, and you did so, tremendously!

Today, we've learned Congressman Toomey is "doubling down" and has purchase=
d an additional week of negative TV ads for $250,000.  We are asking you to=
 please step forward, and make a contribution of $25, $50, $75, $100, $250,=
 whatever you are able to afford, to help us respond!

As the Delco Times said in its editorial, "Toomey Turns to Attack Tactics":

"Enduring election ads is enough of an ordeal.  Having to endure them a ful=
l four months before the general election is downright torturous.

Add the fact that they are attacking an opponent instead of promoting a can=
didate's platform makes them all the more aggravating. Nevertheless, that's=
 the tack Pat Toomey has chosen to take. ...

Last week, Toomey launched a TV ad campaign featuring five commercials. Fou=
r 15-second spots directly attack Sestak. A fifth 30-second ad criticizes t=
he Democratic Party in general...

What is puzzling about Toomey's approach is that he chose to go negative at=
 all, much less early in July.

=E2=80=A6 One would think he would have his own record to stand on in engin=
eering his campaign strategy.

Immediately going for the jugular suggests someone running scared =E2=80=A6

Judging from the negative direction in which Toomey has already taken his c=
ampaign, it appears he does not have confidence in his own ability to beat =
Sestak in November."

With no platform to present to the voters and a past record of supporting t=
he disastrous Bush agenda, Congressman Toomey - - a right-wing ideologue - =
- is "running scared" because of the momentum we've demonstrated and the ca=
mpaign operation we are building and extending throughout Pennsylvania.

When your opponent is "running scared =E2=80=A6 [and] it appears he does no=
t have confidence in his own ability to beat Sestak in November" =E2=80=A6 =
that is when a contribution NOW can be so critical - to keep the pressure o=
n - as our strategy is to win in the summer, so that we dominate in the fal=
l!

Please make a contribution to help us push-back against this upcoming week =
of negative attacks.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/sestak2010?refcode=3Dejul22link3

Your contributions last week allowed us to bring on-line several new office=
s; we'd like to bring several more new offices on-line this week as well.

We are 15 weeks out from election day =E2=80=A6 let's keep Congressman Toom=
ey "running scared"!
=20
Best regards,
Rich Sestak
Campaign Director
