Clips:
*Highlight #1
**Palin Answers on Domestic Policy and Earmarks *(MSNBC 09/12/08 6:00pm)
CHARLES GIBSON: Yesterday we talked of foreign affairs and national
security, today, she opened her home to us and we talked about domestic
policy. She and John McCain are trying to lay claim to being the agents of
change. Implicit in that is criticism of the way the Bush administration ha=
s
been running things.

[cut to interview]

GIBSON: Governor, John McCain and you are now talking about the GOP as the
party of change. We've got a very sick economy. Tell me the three principle
things you would do to change the Bush economic policies.

SARAH PALIN: And you're right, our economy is weak right now and we have go=
t
strengthen it. And government can play an appropriate role in helping to
strengthen the economy. Our 6.1% unemployment rate is unacceptable also
across our nation. We need to put government back on the side of the people
and make sure that it is not government solely looked at for all the
solutions for one. Government has got to get out of the way in some respect=
s
of the private sector being able to create the jobs that we need. Jobs that
are going to allow for the families to be able to afford, healthcare, to be
able to afford their mortgages, to be able to afford college tuition for
their kids. That's got to be the principle here: reform government,
recognize that it's not government to be looked at to solve all the
problems. Taxes of course I think is one of the most important things that
government can, obviously control and help with this issue.

GIBSON: What you said to me at the beginning, I don't think anybody in the
Bush administration would disagree with. What do you change in the in the
Bush economic plans?

PALIN: We have got to make sure that we reform the oversight also of the
agencies, including the quasi-government agencies, like Freddie and Fannie,
those things that have created an atmosphere here in America where people
are fearful of losing their homes, people are looking at job loss, people
are looking at unaffordable health care for their families, we have got to
reform the oversight of these agencies that have such control over
American's pocketbooks.

GIBSON: So, let me summarize the three things that you'd change in the Bush
economic plans . . .

PALIN: Reduce taxes, control spending, reform the oversight and the
overseeing agencies and committees to make sure that America's dollars and
investments are protected.

GIBSON: So, let me . . . break some of those down. You said cut spending.
How much smaller would a McCain budget be, where would you cut?

PALIN: We will find efficiencies in every department. We've got to. There
are some things that I think should be off the table. Veteran's programs,
off the table . . . that's the greatest manifestation that we can show, in
terms of support for our military, those who are in public service, fightin=
g
for America. We've got to make sure that our veterans are taken care of and
our promises are fulfilled.

GIBSON: So you'd take military off the table and veteran's benefits. That's
20% of the budget.

PALIN: Veteran's benefits off the table.

GIBSON: Do you talk about entitlement reform? Is there money you can save i=
n
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?

PALIN: There are certainly efficiencies that are going to be found in all o=
f
these agencies. I am confident in that.

GIBSON: But agencies are not involved in entitlements. Basically
discretionary spending is 18% of the budget.

PALIN: We have certainly seen excess in agencies though. And in, when
bureaucrats, when bureaucracy gets kind of comfortable, going with the
status quo, and not being challenge to find efficiencies and spend other
people's money wisely, then that's where we get into the situation that we
are into today. And that is a tremendous growth of government, a huge debt,
trillions of dollars of debt that we're passing on to my kids and your kids
and your grandkids. It's unacceptable.

GIBSON: One off John McCain's central campaign arguments . . . is
eliminating earmarks. Getting rid of them. Are you with John McCain on that=
?

PALIN: I certainly am. And of course the poster child for the earmarks was
Alaska's. What people in the lower 48 refer to as the "bridge to nowhere."
Of course it was a bridge to a community with an airport in southeast
Alaska. But that was excessive and an earmark like that, not even supported
necessarily by the majority of Alaskans. We killed that earmark, we killed
that project.

GIBSON: But it's no pretty clearly documented, you supported that bridge
before you opposed it. But you turned against it after congress had
basically pulled the plug on it. Do you want to revise and extend your
remarks on=97

PALIN: It has always been an embarrassment that abuse of the earform,
earmark process has been accepted in congress and that's what John McCain
has fought and that's what I joined him in fighting. It's been an
embarrassment, not just Alaska's projects but McCain gives example after
example after example. And now, obviously, Charlie, with the federal
government saying, "No, the rest of the nation does not want to fund that
project." You have a choice, you either read the writing on the wall and
understand, ok, yeah, that project's going nowhere and the state isn't
willing to fund that project, so what good does it do to continue to suppor=
t
something that circumstances have so drastically changed. You call and
audible and you deal in reality and you move on. And Charlie, we killed the
bridge to nowhere and that's the bottom line.

GIBSON: You said you now agree with John McCain that earmarks should be
eliminated. The state of Alaska, governor, this year, requested $3.2 millio=
n
for researching the genetics of harbor seals, money to study the mating
habits of crabs, isn't that exactly the kind of thing that John McCain is
objecting to?

PALIN: Those requests through our research divisions and fish and game and
wildlife departments and our university, those research requests did go
through that system, but wanting it to be in the light of day, not behind
the closed doors with lobbyists making deals with congress to stick things
in there under the public radar. That's the abuse that we want to stop.

GIBSON: In the time I have left, I want to talk about some social issues.
Roe v. Wade, you think it should be reversed.

PALIN: I think it should I think that states should be able to decide that
issue. I am pro-life, I do respect other people's opinion on this also, and
I think that a culture of life is best for America. What I want to do when
elected vice-president, with John McCain, hopefully be able to reach out an=
d
work with those who are on the other side of this issue. Because I know we
can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America
and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and
should be empowered to embrace to allow that culture of life. That's my
personal opinion on this Charlie.

GIBSON: John McCain would allow abortion in cases of rape and incest, you
believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is endangered.

PALIN: That is my personal opinion.

GIBSON: Would you change and accept it in rape and incest?

PALIN: My personal opinion is that abortion allowed if the life of the
mother is endangered. Please, understand me on this. I do understand
McCain's position on this. I do understand others who are very passionate
about this issue who have a differing view.

GIBSON: Embryonic stem cell research. John McCain has been supportive of it=
.

PALIN: You know, when you're running for office, your life's an open book
and you do owe it to Americans to talk about your personal opinion which ma=
y
end up being different than what the policy in an administration would be.
My personal opinion is we should create human life, create an embryo and
then destroy it for research if there are other options our there. And
thankfully again, not only are there other options but we're getting closer
and closer to finding a tremendous amount more of options. Like, as I just
mentioned, the adult skin cell research.

GIBSON: Homosexuality. Genetic or learned?

PALIN: Oh, I don't know but I'm not one to judge and I, you know, I'm from =
a
family and a community with many, many members of many diverse backgrounds
and I'm not going to judge someone on whether they believe that
homosexuality is a choice or a genetic, I'm not going to judge.

GIBSON: Seventy percent of this country supports a ban on automatic weapons=
.
Do you?

PALIN: I do not. And, here again, life being an open book, here as a
candidate. I'm a lifetime member of the NRA, I believe strongly in our
second amendment rights. That's kind of inherent in the people of my state
who rely on guns for, not just self-protection, also for our hunting and fo=
r
sport also. It's a part of the culture here in Alaska; I've just grown up
with that.

GIBSON: After the sit-down interview, we walked out to the Palin backyard .
. . as we stood there, taking in the view, Gov. Palin mentioned Hillary
Clinton. I saw you quoted somewhere speaking somewhat admiringly of . . .
Sen. Clinton during the primary campaign. Do you think Obama should have
picked her?

PALIN: I think he's regretting not picking her now. I do. What determinatio=
n
and grit and even grace through some tough shots that was fired her way. Sh=
e
handled those well.

GIBSON: One historic candidate talking about another.

*Palin Addresses Banning Books, Women's Rights *(MSNBC 09/12/08 6:20pm)
CHARLES GIBSON: Finally tonight, there is a personal side in Sarah Palin's
run for the presidency. Even in this day and age, people wonder if a woman,
even the governor of a state can have it all.

[cut to interview]

GIBSON: Is it sexist for people to ask how can somebody manage a family of
seven and the vice-presidency. Is that a sexist question to ask?

PALIN: I don't know. I'm lucky to have been brought up in a family where
gender's never been an issue. I'm a product of Title IX also where we had
equality in schools, it was just being ushered in with sports and equal
opportunity for education. All my life. I'm part of that generation where
that question is kind of irrelevant because it's accepted. Of course you ca=
n
be the vice president and raise a family. I'm the governor and I'm raising =
a
family. I'm the mayor and have been raising a family. I've owned a business
and we've raised a family. When people asked me when I was governor and
pregnant, "Gosh, how are you going to be the governor and have a baby in
office too?" I replied back then, as I would today, I'll do it the same way
the other governors have done it when they've had either a baby in office o=
r
raised a family, granted their men, but do it the same way they do it.

GIBSON: We posted this question on the internet, we had fifteen thousand
replies within 48 hours and every woman with young children struggles with
this question. Should I? How can I? Will I be able to? And I am curious to
hear about how you've internalized that struggle?

PALIN: Sure. And I understand what that struggle is and what those internal
questions are. I've gone through the same thing over these 19 years from
having my firstborn to today having a newborn in these 19 years a lot of
circumstances have changed. I stayed home with my son until he was 7 years
old, just worked part time until I got into fulltime employment again when
he was seven. I had that choice then and I've had choices of course along
the way.

GIBSON: We also talked with the governor about the so-called troopergate
investigation here in Alaska and the story that's all over the internet,
that she tried to ban books here in Wasilla.

PALIN: Never banned a book, never had the desire to ban a book. It's an old
wives tale is the way I characterize this, whether I ban books or not.


*Highlight #2
**Tucker Bounds Points out How Well Palin Did in her Interview *(MSNBC
09/12/08 2:54pm)
CONTESSA BREWER: Overall, how do you think she did when she was being
presented with some tough questions on foreign policy.

TUCKER BOUNDS: I think it was a fabulous interview, I think she articulated
in a very impactful way, made a case that she's ready to be president of th=
e
United States. Not just vice president of the United States, she's ready to
take on, take a leadership role. She has excellent experience. She's the
only candidate in this race on either ticket that has executive experience,
overseeing a budget, crossing out wasteful spending. She's an excellent
candidate. We're happy to have her on the ticket. The interview last night
was great.

BREWER: . . . she's going to do some solo campaigning, say in Carson City,
Nevada. Do you think that she's more of a help alongside McCain or separate=
d
from him so that there's more ground that gets covered.

BOUNDS: Well, I think it's a benefit either way, I think that John McCain
definitely likes campaigning with his running mate. But also, it's nice to
be able to split up the ticket and move across the target states, reaching
out directly to voters. You know, the one thing, Contessa, I'd like to
mention, is that interview last night, you know, so many of those answers
were so right on the money and the question that you pulled there is the
answer that every American wants to hear. That we want, we want, good and
extraordinary amounts of intelligence so that when there is an inherent
effect or threat coming at our country, that we're going to have the
response. The measured response, the smart response we need in the White
House and that's what John McCain and that's what Gov. Palin represent.

*Mitt Romney Discusses Sarah Palin's Knowledge of World Affairs* (FNC
09/12/08 4:30pm)
MITT ROMNEY:  She was obviously knowledgeable, well prepared, thoughtful. A=
n
experienced person.  She's an executive; she's learned how to make
decisions; she know how to draw on the expertise of people to brief her,
provide information and then be able to make the decisions necessary.  No
one's going to be Henry Kissinger, even if they want to be. But she did a
terrific job [=85] in putting to bed the questions that have been raised by
people who thought she didn't have what it takes to become not only vice
president but president, if the necessity were required.

NEIL CAVUTO: I understand that she doesn't need Henry Kissinger, as an
impression, but that's a whole separate issue.  Governor, what do you make
of the fact, I guess this is predictable in an election year, how each side
[=85] carried an impression of the interview, obviously democrats saying it
proves that she's nervous, she is unsure of herself. We just found out that
she got a passport last year, inexperienced. The republicans say she is
comfortable, she seemed to be in her own element, able to deal with all the
questions, but what do you think ultimately went out with the American
people? You know [=85] how these kinds of appearances matter. What will
resonate or hope will resonate with just average folks watching this?

ROMNEY:  Well, I think people who watch Sarah Palin like her, and they say,
"There's a person who understands me and understands what's going on in my
life. It's person who I can trust.  I think they say this is not your
typical politician.  This is a person who is very different, and Washington
could well deserve and could well use someone like Sarah Palin. I think
they've seen a lot of John McCain and Barack Obama, and now they got a new
face and a person who they can identify and connect with, and I think they
want to see her in Washington. So, I'm convinced that the buzz and the bump
that came out of her nomination -- the buzz and the bump is going to
continue. To propel her forward.   And I think the Obama people are frankly
just on their heels; they don't know to deal with. They've tried everything=
,
one attack after another and people are just rejecting it, saying look, I'v=
e
watched Sarah Palin, I've heard her.  She's thoughtful, she's experienced,
she 's capable, and they're willing to support her.

CAVUTO: Governor, I have a theory on this, and you know it better than
anyone.  When you were surging, and emerged as a potential front runner in
the race from out of nowhere, I'm sure you knew how it got to be,
journalists who interviewed you would go for the gotcha moment.  Now Sarah
Palin's going for that, where everyone's going for the gotcha moment.  [=85=
]
How would you advise her going forward, because she's going to talk to folk=
s
like me, and [=85] even worse [=85]. How do you deal with that? [=85]

ROMNEY:  Well first of all, I think the American people have gotten used to
this "gotcha" politics.  [=85] What's the cost of a gallon of milk?  What's
the cost of a loaf of bread? He didn't try that on her, because obviously
she knows the answers for those things.  [=85] I think the American people =
are
beginning to dismiss the idea that a quiz show is the way to determine who
the next president should be.  [=85] I think when there are attempts at a
gotcha question, the American people are growing tired of it, and they don'=
t
pay a lot of attention.  And I think what she did was demonstrate the kind
of knowledgeable, thoughtful experience that you want in a leader of the
nation. So they found that she passed pretty darn well.  And will there be =
a
mistake here and there? I would presume so.  We're all human.  But I think
the American people have said, these slips of the tongue or mistake here an=
d
there [=85] they just don't pay a lot of attention.   [=85]

CAVUTO: When you were in the race, did you have to get a briefing book of
all the state capitals, all the country capitals, the leaders of foreign
countries, even obscure ones [=85]?

ROMNEY: Well, I think you have to be well read. I think somebody who's
running for national office have to be reading books, has to be reading
newspapers, magazines, watching broadcast coverage to figure out what's
going on around the world.  But I don't the American people expect a [=85]
vice presidential candidate to exactly know the capitals and leaders of
every country in the world.  And if you get asked about who's the president
of Tanzania, you sort of smile and say, that's not how we're going to choos=
e
our president.  But you sure better know who the prime minister is of Iraq,
and have some perspectives on whether he's successful or not successful in
his endeavors to strengthen the Iraqi military.  These are the kinds of
issues that are front and center, and the ones they use to assess someone's
capacity to deal with the kinds of problems that are faced in the White
House. [=85]

s on Domestic Policy and Earmarks </i></b>(MSNBC 09/12/08
6:00pm)<br>CHARLES GIBSON: Yesterday we talked of foreign affairs and
national security, today, she opened her home to us and we talked about
domestic policy. She and John McCain are trying to lay claim to being the
agents of change. Implicit in that is criticism of the way the Bush
administration has been running things.<br>&nbsp;<br>[cut to interview]<br>=
&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: Governor, John McCain and you are now talking about
the GOP as the party of change. We've got a very sick economy. Tell me the
three principle things you would do to change the Bush economic policies.<b=
r>&nbsp;<br>SARAH PALIN: And you're right, our economy is weak right now
and we have got strengthen it. And government can play an appropriate role =
in
helping to strengthen the economy. Our 6.1% unemployment rate is unacceptab=
le
also across our nation. We need to put government back on the side of the
people and make sure that it is not government solely looked at for all the
solutions for one. Government has got to get out of the way in some respect=
s of
the private sector being able to create the jobs that we need. Jobs that ar=
e
going to allow for the families to be able to afford, healthcare, to be abl=
e to
afford their mortgages, to be able to afford college tuition for their kids=
.
That's got to be the principle here: reform government, recognize that it's=
 not
government to be looked at to solve all the problems. Taxes of course I thi=
nk
is one of the most important things that government can, obviously control =
and
help with this issue.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: What you said to me at the begin=
ning, I don't think
anybody in the Bush administration would disagree with. What do you change =
in
the in the Bush economic plans?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: We have got to make sur=
e that we reform the oversight
also of the agencies, including the quasi-government agencies, like Freddie=
 and
Fannie, those things that have created an atmosphere here in America where
people are fearful of losing their homes, people are looking at job loss,
people are looking at unaffordable health care for their families, we have =
got
to reform the oversight of these agencies that have such control over
American's pocketbooks.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: So, let me summarize the three=
 things that you'd
change in the Bush economic plans . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: Reduce taxes, c=
ontrol spending, reform the oversight
and the overseeing agencies and committees to make sure that America's doll=
ars
and investments are protected.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: So, let me . . . break =
some of those down. You said
cut spending. How much smaller would a McCain budget be, where would you cu=
t?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: We will find efficiencies in every department. We've
got to. There are some things that I think should be off the table. Veteran=
's
programs, off the table . . . that's the greatest manifestation that we can
show, in terms of support for our military, those who are in public service=
,
fighting for America. We've got to make sure that our veterans are taken ca=
re
of and our promises are fulfilled.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: So you'd take milit=
ary off the table and veteran's
benefits. That's 20% of the budget.<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: Veteran's benefits =
off the table.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: Do you talk about entitlement reform? I=
s there money
you can save in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: Th=
ere are certainly efficiencies that are going to be
found in all of these agencies. I am confident in that.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON=
: But agencies are not involved in entitlements.
Basically discretionary spending is 18% of the budget.<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: =
We have certainly seen excess in agencies though. And
in, when bureaucrats, when bureaucracy gets kind of comfortable, going with=
 the
status quo, and not being challenge to find efficiencies and spend other
people's money wisely, then that's where we get into the situation that we =
are
into today. And that is a tremendous growth of government, a huge debt,
trillions of dollars of debt that we're passing on to my kids and your kids=
 and
your grandkids. It's unacceptable.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: One off John McCain=
's central campaign arguments . .
. is eliminating earmarks. Getting rid of them. Are you with John McCain on
that?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: I certainly am. And of course the poster child fo=
r
the earmarks was Alaska's. What people in the lower 48 refer to as the "bri=
dge
to nowhere." Of course it was a bridge to a community with an airport in
southeast Alaska. But that was excessive and an earmark like that, not even
supported necessarily by the majority of Alaskans. We killed that earmark, =
we
killed that project.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: But it's no pretty clearly docume=
nted, you supported
that bridge before you opposed it. But you turned against it after congress=
 had
basically pulled the plug on it. Do you want to revise and extend your rema=
rks
on=97<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: It has always been an embarrassment that abuse of=
 the
earform, earmark process has been accepted in congress and that's what John=
 McCain
has fought and that's what I joined him in fighting. It's been an
embarrassment, not just Alaska's projects but McCain gives example after
example after example. And now, obviously, Charlie, with the federal govern=
ment
saying, "No, the rest of the nation does not want to fund that project." Yo=
u
have a choice, you either read the writing on the wall and understand, ok,
yeah, that project's going nowhere and the state isn't willing to fund that
project, so what good does it do to continue to support something that
circumstances have so drastically changed. You call and audible and you dea=
l in
reality and you move on. And Charlie, we killed the bridge to nowhere and
that's the bottom line.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: You said you now agree with Jo=
hn McCain that
earmarks should be eliminated. The state of Alaska, governor, this year,
requested $3.2 million for researching the genetics of harbor seals, money =
to
study the mating habits of crabs, isn't that exactly the kind of thing that
John McCain is objecting to?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: Those requests through our=
 research divisions and
fish and game and wildlife departments and our university, those research
requests did go through that system, but wanting it to be in the light of d=
ay,
not behind the closed doors with lobbyists making deals with congress to st=
ick
things in there under the public radar. That's the abuse that we want to st=
op.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: In the time I have left, I want to talk about some
social issues. Roe v. Wade, you think it should be reversed.<br>&nbsp;<br>P=
ALIN: I think it should I think that states should be able
to decide that issue. I am pro-life, I do respect other people's opinion on
this also, and I think that a culture of life is best for America. What I w=
ant
to do when elected vice-president, with John McCain, hopefully be able to r=
each
out and work with those who are on the other side of this issue. Because I =
know
we can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in Amer=
ica
and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and
should be empowered to embrace to allow that culture of life. That's my
personal opinion on this Charlie.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: John McCain would al=
low abortion in cases of rape
and incest, you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother=
 is
endangered.<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: That is my personal opinion.<br>&nbsp;<br>G=
IBSON: Would you change and accept it in rape and incest?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALI=
N: My personal opinion is that abortion allowed if the
life of the mother is endangered. Please, understand me on this. I do
understand McCain's position on this. I do understand others who are very
passionate about this issue who have a differing view.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON:=
 Embryonic stem cell research. John McCain has been
supportive of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: You know, when you're running for off=
ice, your life's
an open book and you do owe it to Americans to talk about your personal opi=
nion
which may end up being different than what the policy in an administration
would be. My personal opinion is we should create human life, create an emb=
ryo
and then destroy it for research if there are other options our there. And
thankfully again, not only are there other options but we're getting closer=
 and
closer to finding a tremendous amount more of options. Like, as I just
mentioned, the adult skin cell research.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: Homosexuality=
. Genetic or learned?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: Oh, I don't know but I'm not one =
to judge and I, you
know, I'm from a family and a community with many, many members of many div=
erse
backgrounds and I'm not going to judge someone on whether they believe that
homosexuality is a choice or a genetic, I'm not going to judge.<br>&nbsp;<b=
r>GIBSON: Seventy percent of this country supports a ban on
automatic weapons. Do you?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: I do not. And, here again, l=
ife being an open book,
here as a candidate. I'm a lifetime member of the NRA, I believe strongly i=
n
our second amendment rights. That's kind of inherent in the people of my st=
ate
who rely on guns for, not just self-protection, also for our hunting and fo=
r
sport also. It's a part of the culture here in Alaska; I've just grown up w=
ith
that.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: After the sit-down interview, we walked out to t=
he
Palin backyard . . . as we stood there, taking in the view, Gov. Palin
mentioned Hillary Clinton. I saw you quoted somewhere speaking somewhat
admiringly of . . . Sen. Clinton during the primary campaign. Do you think
Obama should have picked her?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: I think he's regretting n=
ot picking her now. I do.
What determination and grit and even grace through some tough shots that wa=
s
fired her way. She handled those well.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: One historic ca=
ndidate talking about another.<br><span></span> <br><b><i>Palin Addresses B=
anning Books, Women's Rights </i></b>(MSNBC 09/12/08
6:20pm)<br>CHARLES GIBSON: Finally tonight, there is a personal side in
Sarah Palin's run for the presidency. Even in this day and age, people wond=
er
if a woman, even the governor of a state can have it all.<br>&nbsp;<br>[cut=
 to interview]<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: Is it sexist for people to ask how can =
somebody
manage a family of seven and the vice-presidency. Is that a sexist question=
 to
ask?<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: I don't know. I'm lucky to have been brought up in=
 a
family where gender's never been an issue. I'm a product of Title IX also w=
here
we had equality in schools, it was just being ushered in with sports and eq=
ual
opportunity for education. All my life. I'm part of that generation where t=
hat
question is kind of irrelevant because it's accepted. Of course you can be =
the
vice president and raise a family. I'm the governor and I'm raising a famil=
y.
I'm the mayor and have been raising a family. I've owned a business and we'=
ve
raised a family. When people asked me when I was governor and pregnant, "Go=
sh,
how are you going to be the governor and have a baby in office too?" I repl=
ied
back then, as I would today, I'll do it the same way the other governors ha=
ve
done it when they've had either a baby in office or raised a family, grante=
d
their men, but do it the same way they do it.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: We poste=
d this question on the internet, we had
fifteen thousand replies within 48 hours and every woman with young childre=
n
struggles with this question. Should I? How can I? Will I be able to? And I=
 am
curious to hear about how you've internalized that struggle?<br>&nbsp;<br>P=
ALIN: Sure. And I understand what that struggle is and what
those internal questions are. I've gone through the same thing over these 1=
9
years from having my firstborn to today having a newborn in these 19 years =
a
lot of circumstances have changed. I stayed home with my son until he was 7
years old, just worked part time until I got into fulltime employment again
when he was seven. I had that choice then and I've had choices of course al=
ong
the way.<br>&nbsp;<br>GIBSON: We also talked with the governor about the so=
-called
troopergate investigation here in Alaska and the story that's all over the
internet, that she tried to ban books here in Wasilla.<br>&nbsp;<br>PALIN: =
Never banned a book, never had the desire to ban a
book. It's an old wives tale is the way I characterize this, whether I ban
books or not.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><u>Highlight #2<br></u><b><i>Tucker Bo=
unds Points out How Well Palin Did in her Interview </i></b>(MSNBC
09/12/08 2:54pm)<br>CONTESSA BREWER: Overall, how do you think she did when=
 she
was being presented with some tough questions on foreign policy.<br>&nbsp;<=
br>TUCKER BOUNDS: I think it was a fabulous interview, I think
she articulated in a very impactful way, made a case that she's ready to be
president of the United States. Not just vice president of the United State=
s,
she's ready to take on, take a leadership role. She has excellent experienc=
e.
She's the only candidate in this race on either ticket that has executive
experience, overseeing a budget, crossing out wasteful spending. She's an
excellent candidate. We're happy to have her on the ticket. The interview l=
ast
night was great.<br>&nbsp;<br>BREWER: . . . she's going to do some solo cam=
paigning, say
in Carson City, Nevada. Do you think that she's more of a help alongside Mc=
Cain
or separated from him so that there's more ground that gets covered.<br>&nb=
sp;<br>BOUNDS: Well, I think it's a benefit either way, I think
that John McCain definitely likes campaigning with his running mate. But al=
so,
it's nice to be able to split up the ticket and move across the target stat=
es,
reaching out directly to voters. You know, the one thing, Contessa, I'd lik=
e to
mention, is that interview last night, you know, so many of those answers w=
ere
so right on the money and the question that you pulled there is the answer =
that
every American wants to hear. That we want, we want, good and extraordinary
amounts of intelligence so that when there is an inherent effect or threat
coming at our country, that we're going to have the response. The measured
response, the smart response we need in the White House and that's what Joh=
n
McCain and that's what Gov. Palin represent.<br>&nbsp;<br><b><i>Mitt Romney=
 Discusses Sarah Palin's Knowledge of World Affairs</i></b>
(FNC 09/12/08 4:30pm)<br>MITT ROMNEY:<span>&nbsp;
</span>She was obviously knowledgeable, well prepared, thoughtful. An
experienced person.<span>&nbsp; </span>She's an
executive; she's learned how to make decisions; she know how to draw on the
expertise of people to brief her, provide information and then be able to m=
ake
the decisions necessary.<span>&nbsp; </span>No one's
going to be Henry Kissinger, even if they want to be. But she did a terrifi=
c
job [=85] in putting to bed the questions that have been raised by people w=
ho
thought she didn't have what it takes to become not only vice president but
president, if the necessity were required.<br>&nbsp;<br>NEIL CAVUTO: I unde=
rstand that she doesn't need Henry Kissinger,
as an impression, but that's a whole separate issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gov=
ernor, what do you make of the fact, I guess this is predictable
in an election year, how each side [=85] carried an impression of the inter=
view, obviously
democrats saying it proves that she's nervous, she is unsure of herself. We
just found out that she got a passport last year, inexperienced. The
republicans say she is comfortable, she seemed to be in her own element, ab=
le
to deal with all the questions, but what do you think ultimately went out w=
ith
the American people? You know [=85] how these kinds of appearances matter. =
What will
resonate or hope will resonate with just average folks watching this?<br>&n=
bsp;<br>ROMNEY: <span>&nbsp;</span>Well, I
think people who watch Sarah Palin like her, and they say, &quot;There's a
person who understands me and understands what's going on in my life. It's
person who I can trust.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think
they say this is not your typical politician. <span>&nbsp;</span>This is a =
person who is very different, and Washington could
well deserve and could well use someone like Sarah Palin. I think they've s=
een
a lot of John McCain and Barack Obama, and now they got a new face and a pe=
rson
who they can identify and connect with, and I think they want to see her in=
 Washington.
So, I'm convinced that the buzz and the bump that came out of her nominatio=
n --
the buzz and the bump is going to continue. To propel her forward.<span>&nb=
sp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>And I think the Obama people are frankly just=
 on their heels;
they don't know to deal with. They've tried everything, one attack after
another and people are just rejecting it, saying look, I've watched Sarah P=
alin,
I've heard her.<span>&nbsp; </span>She's thoughtful,
she's experienced, she 's capable, and they're willing to support her.<br>&=
nbsp;<br>CAVUTO: Governor, I have a theory on this, and you know it
better than anyone.<span>&nbsp; </span>When you were
surging, and emerged as a potential front runner in the race from out of
nowhere, I'm sure you knew how it got to be, journalists who interviewed yo=
u
would go for the gotcha moment.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now Sarah Palin's going for that, where everyone's going for the got=
cha
moment.<span>&nbsp; </span>[=85] How would you advise
her going forward, because she's going to talk to folks like me, and [=85] =
even
worse [=85]. How do you deal with that? [=85]<br>&nbsp;<br>ROMNEY:<span>&nb=
sp; </span>Well
first of all, I think the American people have gotten used to this "gotcha"
politics.<span>&nbsp; </span>[=85] What's the cost of a
gallon of milk?<span>&nbsp; </span>What's the cost of
a loaf of bread? He didn't try that on her, because obviously she knows the
answers for those things.<span>&nbsp; </span>[=85] I
think the American people are beginning to dismiss the idea that a quiz sho=
w is
the way to determine who the next president should be.<span>&nbsp; </span>[=
=85] I think when there are attempts at
a gotcha question, the American people are growing tired of it, and they do=
n't
pay a lot of attention.<span>&nbsp; </span>And I
think what she did was demonstrate the kind of knowledgeable, thoughtful
experience that you want in a leader of the nation. So they found that she
passed pretty darn well.<span>&nbsp; </span>And will
there be a mistake here and there? I would presume so.<span>&nbsp; </span>W=
e're all human.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I think the American people have
said, these slips of the tongue or mistake here and there [=85] they just d=
on't
pay a lot of attention.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>[=85]<br>&nbsp;<br>CAVUTO:=
 When you were in the race, did you have to get a
briefing book of all the state capitals, all the country capitals, the lead=
ers
of foreign countries, even obscure ones [=85]?<br>&nbsp;<br>ROMNEY: Well, I=
 think you have to be well read. I think
somebody who's running for national office have to be reading books, has to=
 be
reading newspapers, magazines, watching broadcast coverage to figure out wh=
at's
going on around the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I
don't the American people expect a [=85] vice presidential candidate to exa=
ctly
know the capitals and leaders of every country in the world.<span>&nbsp; </=
span>And if you get asked about who's the
president of Tanzania, you sort of smile and say, that's not how we're goin=
g to
choose our president.<span>&nbsp; </span>But you sure
better know who the prime minister is of Iraq, and have some perspectives o=
n
whether he's successful or not successful in his endeavors to strengthen th=
e
Iraqi military.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are the
kinds of issues that are front and center, and the ones they use to assess
someone's capacity to deal with the kinds of problems that are faced in the
White House. [=85]<br></div></div><br>-- <br>Evan Whitbeck<br>Tracker/Media=
