*HRC Call @ 5:45pm // Donna @ 5:30pm*
Flagging that Oren is going to be be scheduling a call w/ Navin, Mandy,
Joel, Jim, Robby and HRC at approx. 5:45PM to review the IA/NH data
(focusing primarily on IA). HRC is free for a full hour then on her drive
to the airport, so we can expect this call will last a while.

I called Donna's assistant and Donna CAN come early at 5:00 pm (Still TBD
on Maura, but her assist said it's very likely she can come then as well).

Then, schedule would be:

4:15-5:00: Message for the week call
5:00-5:45/6:00: Donna/Maura
6:00-6:45: HRC data call (HRC's call window is 5:45/6:00-7:00 ET)
6:45: Kenneth Cole

*POC for Midtown office*
Anne Sciaino
Cell: (973) 715-5609
Midtown Office: (646) 647-2740

*Daniel Oberhaus-- VICE on Aliens*

Sent in below questions and is working on a deadline of *TODAY*. You
suggested email answers, but these questions are long and detailed. Do you
want me to set up a call with him? Or let him know that you won't be able
to get to it until tomorrow? I'm also happy to hop on the phone, type up
your responses, and respond to Daniel.



*Why do you think that the disclosure of UFO related documents is
important?*

*It seems like a lot of UFO documents would contain sensitive military
information =E2=80=93 how would you go about getting these released?*


*Do you think if Hillary is elected she would make good on her promise to
get to the bottom of this UFO business? Why?*


*Other than Hillary, are there any other alien-friendly candidates in the
running? If not, why do you think this is?*


*What makes you think there is information on UFO and extraterrestrials
that the government is not sharing with the people? What would the motive
be for this?*


*If it turned out that there was information being withheld, how do you
think people would react to it? Are we ready to hear this? Why/why not?*
