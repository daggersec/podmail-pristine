Hi John,

I hope you=E2=80=99re doing well. Not sure if you saw my email from last =
week. After doing some research, I=E2=80=99ve decided to tweak my topic =
slightly to focus on the Inspectors General, rather than the GAO, and on =
ways that Congress could streamline the IGs and strengthen their =
oversight power and specifically their ability to obtain =
records/documents/testimony from their respective agencies. This just =
seems like much more of a hot topic right now, with many recent =
Congressional hearings on this and related issues. It=E2=80=99s also =
much more interesting to me personally.

Let me know if you have any concerns.

Thank you,
Matt
