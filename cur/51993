Subject: Upcoming National Security Fundraiser

John=2C Jeff=2C Michele=97 Thank you for including me in the upcoming natio=
nal security event scheduled for Friday=2C October 16. I=92ve got a lot of =
younger people who are interested in the national security space but are li=
mited in the amount that they can contribute. My own recommendation is that=
 we should be thinking about broadening the participation pool and supporte=
rs for Secretary Clinton and that you might consider a slightly smaller con=
tribution for events like this. This helps get people into the system and a=
lso generates support. I=92ll take your lead on this but I think it=92s som=
ething we should consider.With all best wishes=2CKurt 		 	   		  =

curity event scheduled for Friday=2C October 16. I=92ve got a lot of younge=
r people who are interested in the national security space but are limited =
in the amount that they can contribute. My own recommendation is that we sh=
ould be thinking about broadening the participation pool and supporters for=
 Secretary Clinton and that you might consider a slightly smaller contribut=
ion for events like this. This helps get people into the system and also ge=
nerates support. I=92ll take your lead on this but I think it=92s something=
 we should consider.</div><div style=3D"font-family:Calibri=2C sans-serif=
