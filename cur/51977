John,
Hope you=92re doing OK amidst all that is going on.
I=92d like to list you as a reference for a proposal I=92m submitting to =
Open Society Foundation.  It would allow me to spend some time =
(alongside my consulting practice) putting together a plan (likely =
legislative or regulatory) to implement US development, defense, =
diplomacy (Ie =91smart power=92) assistance/resources more effectively, =
along with a route to develop popular support for it.  I need three =
references, as was hoping you=92d agree to be one.  (Nothing to write, I =
just need to give the OSF folks an email and phone # for you and think =
they only reach out if I make it to the final group which is likely a =
long shot.)  Let me know.
Thanks
Mara=
