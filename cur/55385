Dear Friends and Colleagues,

Below are a few great examples of how we are working to bring
attention to all issues that impact voters, from Medicaid expansion,
to ensuring public safety, and the ongoing campaign around gun
control. These are just 3 of our 21 states doing what we do every day
- make progress happen, and happen NOW.

As always, let me know what you think, or even better, contribute to
us here.

AND - don't forget to vote for your "favorite"
right-winger in our own network-wide bracket. The "Crazy
8" are ready to compete for getting into the "Infamous
Four." You can find it here: www.marchbadness.org

Progress Iowa Educates Voters About Medicate Expansion Through the
"Medicaid Madness" Statewide Tour

Wednesday, March 27th kicked off the "Medicaid Madness"
tour as part of the Healthiest Iowa Initiative (coordinated by 26
organizations, led by Progress Iowa) as a way to educate Iowans about
Medicaid expansion which would cover an additional 150,000 Iowans
including uninsured young adults, veterans, the working poor, and
mentally ill. A press conference Monday morning, March 25th, launching
the Healthiest Iowa Initiative, was held in the same location and
immediately prior to the Governor's weekly press conference, enhancing
media coverage on the issue. Wednesday's "Medicaid Madness" events
generated press coverage across the state, including in 5 of Iowa's 7
television markets. Although the Governor has objected to the
expansion because of a potential failure on the part of the federal
government to honor its commitments, Governor Branstad's
alternative plan costs Iowa more and still relies on the federal
government for funding. Iowans who attend the events are asked to sign
a petition calling on Governor Branstad's support, and Progress
Iowa and the partnering organizations hope to gain enough momentum
behind the expansion to influence the Governor's decision.=A0

Granite State Progress Applauds the New Hampshire House's
Decision to Repeal "Kill at Will" Law

The New Hampshire House voted to repeal the ALEC model law known as
the "Kill at Will" law this past Wednesday, March 27th.
With a vote of 189-184 the House voted to repeal the law and instead
adopt the bi-partisan majority committee report on House Bill 135.
Zandra Rice Hawkins, Executive Director of Granite State Progress,
says that the vote "signals that the House is ready to restore
balance and common sense to public safety in New Hampshire" and
that HB 135 "simply requires basic common sense that Granite
Staters will use violence as a last resort, not the first
option." The bill will now move to the Senate, and Granite State
Progress will be calling on state Senators to put aside the rhetoric
make the right decision to protect citizens.

Progress Now Nevada Draws Major Media Attention Around The Campaign On
Gun Control

ProgressNevada Gun Control 2

ProgressNow Nevada joined with Organizing for Action and Mayors
Against Illegal Guns to coordinate a rally for the National Day of
Action on March 28th, putting pressure on Congress to pass tighter gun
control legislation.=A0 The rally highlighted the fact that 86% of
Nevadans are in favor of universal background background checks, and
demonstrated that now is time for Congress to get behind the voters
and take action on the issue of gun control.=A0 The rally took
place outside Senator Reid and Senator Heller's offices - which was
also the site of a deadly shooting in September of 2011 - further
emphasizing the need for action. The day of action created 48 press
hits statewide, including with Reno CBS, NBC, and ABC and Las Vegas
CBS, NBC, ABC, Telemundo, and Fox, who left out their usual
fabrication and instead referred to the rally for what it was, a gun
control rally.
