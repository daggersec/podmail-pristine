Thanks John.  I spent a little time with her earlier this week and she saw
a few of our folks who were very impressed.  I'm going to see her again
next week and would love to speak with you after that.

I think she's fabulous. I wanted to get her to be GC for the campaign
assuming there is one to be, but roles are a bit complicated with outside
lawyers. I don't think Neera knows she's considering moving on. Let me know
if you would like to discuss.
