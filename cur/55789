**New Poll Shows Union Vote Provided Key Support in Battlegrounds**=20
AFL-CIO Union Voters Help Drive Historic Victory for Obama
Leaders Vow to Continue Grassroots Campaign to Restore Economy That
Works for All
=20
(Washington, November 5) =E2=80=93 Union voters played an important role in
President-elect Obama=E2=80=99s historic victory, delivering a critical blo=
c of
support in swing states that helped propel Obama and other working
family candidates to big wins last night, election-night polling
released by the AFL-CIO today showed. Calling the victory in the
presidential race and the expansion of majorities in the House and
Senate a working families=E2=80=99 mandate for broad-based economic change,
AFL-CIO leaders vowed to continue the large-scale mobilization to push
through broad economic reform.
=20
=E2=80=9CLed by a candidate with an uncommon ability to inspire hope, we
reclaimed our country from those who are serving corporate interests and
the privileged at the expense of everyone else,=E2=80=9D AFL-CIO President =
John
Sweeney said.  =E2=80=9CWe have taken the first crucial steps to build a be=
tter
future for our children and grandchildren.  And what we=E2=80=99ve seen =E2=
=80=93 the
stunning voter participation and the common call for change =E2=80=93 is an
indication of the history we can continue to make together.=E2=80=9D =20
=20
High turnout among working-class union voters in states like Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Michigan formed a foundation of support for Obama.  In
new battleground states like Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina and
Florida, Sweeney said the AFL-CIO mounted a bigger effort than ever
before, voting by large margins for Obama, and =E2=80=9Cjoined young people=
 and
other new voters to build a new majority for economic fairness.=E2=80=9D  =
=20
AFL-CIO union members across battleground states supported Obama by a
whopping 68-30 margin, according to an election night survey conducted
for the AFL-CIO by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. =20
=20
=E2=80=9CMore than 250,000 union volunteers took to the streets in the larg=
est
independent voter mobilization in history,=E2=80=9D AFL-CIO Political Commi=
ttee
Chair and AFSCME President Gerald McEntee said.  =E2=80=9CPeople volunteere=
d
because they want a President who will fight for America=E2=80=99s working
families.  In the critical battleground states, workers gave Sen. Obama
the winning edge.=E2=80=9D
=20
Other key findings from the election-night survey include:
=20
=C2=B7 Obama won among white men who are union members by 18 points while
losing that group by 16 points in the general public;
=C2=B7 Obama won among union gun owners by a 12-point margin while losing
that group in the general public by 25 points;=20
=C2=B7 Union veterans voted for Obama by a 25-point margin. He lost among
that group in the general public by nine points;
=C2=B7 Working America members voted 67-30 for Obama. Working America gun
owners (33% own guns) voted 23 points for Obama; general public gun
owners voted 25 points for McCain;
=C2=B7 Sixty percent of union members identified the economy and jobs as
their top issue with 84 percent saying strengthening the economy was the
most important factor in their vote;
=C2=B7 Union members identified protecting pensions and Social Security and
reducing health care costs as the top priorities for the new
Administration;
=C2=B7 Seventy-five percent say the new President and Congress has a mandat=
e
to strengthen the economy, create jobs, and reform health care;
=C2=B7 Eighty-one percent of union members support passing the Employee Fre=
e
Choice Act
=20
The record mobilization for this election won=E2=80=99t end on election day=
,
AFL-CIO leaders said.=20
=20
=E2=80=9CThe election is just step one in delivering the change we need,=E2=
=80=9D
Sweeney said.  =E2=80=9CWorking men and women are poised to keep the energy
pumping to help the Obama administration lead the change we need.  There
will be no gap or letdown.=E2=80=9D
=20
Working families=E2=80=99 immediate and long-term priorities include:
=C2=B7 A broad-based economic recovery package in the short term that
provides aid to cash-strapped local and state governments to maintain
vital services, extends unemployment benefits and increases funding for
food stamps to provide relief to working families who are hurting during
the economic downturn and invests in  infrastructure spending to rebuild
our crumbling roads, bridges and schools and put people to work ;
=C2=B7 Restoring workers=E2=80=99 freedom to join unions and bargain with t=
heir
employers for better wages and benefits by passing the Employee Free
Choice Act;
=C2=B7 Reforming our broken health care system to cut costs for families,
increase access to quality care and provide coverage to the nearly 50
million Americans without health insurance; =20
=C2=B7 Investing in America=E2=80=99s future and create a new economy of go=
od, green
jobs through long-term infrastructure projects; education and skills;
and clean, renewable, home-grown energy;
=C2=B7 Re-regulating Wall Street to restore the integrity of the banking an=
d
financial sectors and protect working people=E2=80=99s hard earned money - =
-
their pensions, savings and homes;
=C2=B7 Developing a new model for fair trade that will restore American
competitiveness and protect good jobs at home and worker=E2=80=99s rights a=
round
the world;
=C2=B7 Enacting broad-based tax reform to end tax giveaways for the wealthy
and corporations that outsource American jobs.
=20
This year=E2=80=99s campaign was the largest, broadest and most targeted ef=
fort
in AFL-CIO history.  The program reached union members, members of union
households, retirees and members of Working America, the AFL-CIO=E2=80=99s
community affiliate for workers who don=E2=80=99t have a union on the job. =
 In
all, the AFL-CIO=E2=80=99s program reached out to more than 13 million unio=
n
voters in 24 battleground states.  The AFL-CIO was engaged in 13 Senate
races, 60 House contests as well as the presidential race. =20
=20
More than 250,000 AFL-CIO volunteers gave up countless evenings and
weekends throughout the course of this campaign to talk to co-workers,
neighbors and other union members about the stakes in this election.  In
the final four days of the election, the AFL-CIO=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CFinal F=
our=E2=80=9D GOTV
program reached millions of union voters in battleground states.
=20
Over the course of the campaign, volunteers made 76 million phone
calls, knocked on 14 million doors and delivered 29 million flyers at
worksites. The AFL-CIO and its affiliate unions sent 57 million pieces
of mail to union households this year. As a result of this effort, 84
percent of union members in battleground states said they heard from
their union this election cycle.
=20
Working America played a central role in delivering working-class union
voters this election. Working America grew to 2.5 million members this
year, including 800,000 members in Ohio alone.  The organization ran a
year-long mobilization, engaging its members =E2=80=93 mostly working-class
moderates and independents -- on health care, green jobs and other
issues important to working families. In the final days before the
election, more than 1,000 full-time canvassers fanned out across 11
battleground states.  In total, Working America knocked on 1.65 million
doors to encourage members to vote and educate them on the candidates=E2=80=
=99
positions on working family issues.
=20
The 2008 effort relied heavily on sophisticated targeting designed to
increase voter turnout for Obama and other working family candidates
among exurban and rural voters in key states. Since identifying more
than 3 million undecided voters in August, the AFL-CIO=E2=80=99s intense
communications among swing groups like retirees, veterans and gun owners
shifted the landscape in states such as Ohio.=20
=20
The AFL-CIO also carried out a nine-state voter protection program to
ensure every vote would count on Election Day. The My Vote, My Right
voting rights protection program worked for several months to educate
citizens about their voting rights, train polling monitors and worked
closely with Secretaries of State on election administration plans,
AFL-CIO Political Director Karen Ackerman said.  On Election Day, the
program deployed more than 2,700 volunteer polling monitors nationwide,
including 800 in Michigan and 500 in both Ohio and Pennsylvania.=20
=20
The AFL-CIO is the nation=E2=80=99s largest umbrella organization of unions=
,
representing 10.5 million working men and women nationwide. =20

increase voter turnout for Obama and other working family candidates among =
exurban and rural voters in key states. Since identifying more than 3 milli=
on undecided voters in August, the AFL-CIO=E2=80=99s intense communications=
 among swing groups like retirees, veterans and gun owners shifted the land=
scape in states such as Ohio. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The AFL-CIO also carried out a nine-state voter protection program to =
ensure every vote would count on Election Day. The My Vote, My Right voting=
 rights protection program worked for several months to educate citizens ab=
out their voting rights, train polling monitors and worked closely with Sec=
retaries of State on election administration plans, AFL-CIO Political Direc=
tor Karen Ackerman said.&nbsp; On Election Day, the program deployed more t=
han 2,700 volunteer polling monitors nationwide, including 800 in Michigan =
and 500 in both Ohio and Pennsylvania. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The AFL-CIO is the nation=E2=80=99s largest umbrella organization of u=
nions, representing 10.5 million working men and women nationwide.&nbsp; <B=
