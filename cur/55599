Code of Ethical Conduct</span></p>

<p>As a condition of being permitted to serve as a member of
the Obama Transition Project, I agree to abide by the following requirements:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I will disqualify myself from involvement in any
particular Obama Transition Project matter which to my knowledge may directly
conflict or appear to conflict with a financial interest of mine, my spouse,
family member, partner, client, or other individual or organization with which
I have a business or close personal relationship or had such a relationship
within the past 12 months.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I will disqualify myself from involvement in any
particular transition matter the subject of which I have engaged in reportable
lobbying activities, as defined by the Lobbying Disclosure Act, within the
previous 12 months.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I will not solicit or accept any money or things of
value in exchange for a promise to support or use influence on behalf of any
person who is a candidate for any appointive office or place in the United
States Government.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I understand that in my Obama Transition
Project-related activities, unless given specific authorization, I am not
permitted to make any representations on behalf of Senator Obama or the
Democratic Nominee for Vice President, their designees, or any official of the
Obama Transition Project.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I understand that authorization is required from the
Obama Transition Project&#39;s Executive Director or the Executive Director&#39;s
designee before seeking, on behalf of the Obama Transition Project, access to
any non-public information.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I will hold in confidence any non-public information
provided to me in the course of my duties with the Obama Transition Project and
ensure that such information is used exclusively for purposes of the Obama
Transition Project.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>I will not use or permit to be used any non-public
information, in any manner, for any private gain for myself or any other party,
at any time during or after the operation of the Obama Transition Fund.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>During my service with the Obama Transition Project, I
will not communicate with or appear before, with the intent to influence, any
federal agency with respect to which I have substantial responsibility during
the activities of the Obama Transition Project, on behalf of any other person
or entity (except federal, state, or local government entities).&nbsp; I will
promptly cause my firm or organization to establish reasonable procedures to
assure that I will not participate in any undertaking with respect to which I
am affected by this provision.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>For 12 months following the conclusion of my service
with the Obama Transition Project, I will not on behalf of any person
communicate with or appear before, with the intent to influence:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>any federal agency on a particular regulatory or policy
matter for which I had substantial responsibility during my service to the
Transition Project.&nbsp; </p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><span>10.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>I

I nor any member of my immediate family will accept a gift from:</p>

</span></span>any person or organization under circumstances where it
may reasonably appear that the gift is being given in order to influence my
decisions, advice, recommendations or actions as an Obama Transition Project
member</p>
