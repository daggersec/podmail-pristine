ran-on-his-blackberry-%e2%80%93-except-he-doesnt-use-one/

John McCain Town Hall Meeting =96 12/7/07:

 "The Iranians are still exporting the most lethal explosive devices across
the Iraqi border and into Iraq and killing brave, young Americans and Iran
is still supporting terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas. So=
,
if they want to communicate with us and we want to communicate with them,
fine. We all have blackberries. It's fine."

Unfortunately John McCain does not use a Blackberry:

    Q: Do you use a Blackberry or e-mail?

    Mr. McCain: No.

In the clip he also compares a poll to a banana. I'm not kidding.
