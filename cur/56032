John --

I'm writing to you on a great day for America.

This morning, I gathered with members of Congress, my administration, and =
hardworking volunteers from every part of the country to sign =
comprehensive health care reform into law. Thanks to the immeasurable =
efforts of so many, the dream of reform is now a reality.

The bill I just signed puts Americans in charge of our own health care by =
enacting three key changes:

It establishes the toughest patient protections in history.

It guarantees all Americans affordable health insurance options, extending =
coverage to 32 million who are currently uninsured.

And it reduces the cost of care -- cutting over 1 trillion dollars from =
the federal deficit over the next two decades.

To ensure a successful, stable transition, many of these changes will =
phase into full effect over the next several years.

But for millions of Americans, many of the benefits of reform will begin =
this year -- some even taking effect this afternoon. Here are just a few =
examples:

Small businesses will receive significant tax cuts, this year, to help =
them afford health coverage for all their employees.

Seniors will receive a rebate to reduce drug costs not yet covered under =
Medicare.

Young people will be allowed coverage under their parents' plan until the =
age of 26.

Early retirees will receive help to reduce premium costs.

Children will be protected against discrimination on the basis of medical =
history.

Uninsured Americans with pre-existing conditions can join a special =
high-risk pool to get the coverage they need, starting in just 90 days.

Insured Americans will be protected from seeing their insurance revoked =
when they get sick, or facing restrictive annual limits on the care they =
receive.

All Americans will benefit from significant new investments to train =
primary care doctors, nurses, and public health professionals, and the =
creation of state-level consumer assistance programs to help all patients =
understand and defend our new rights.

As I've said many times, and as I know to be true, this astounding victory =
could not have been achieved without your tireless efforts.

So as we celebrate this great day, I want to invite you to add your name =
where it belongs: alongside mine as a co-signer of this historic =
legislation. Organizing for America will record the names of co-signers as =
a permanent commemoration of those who came together to make this moment =
possible -- all of you who refused to give up until the dream of many =
generations for affordable, quality care for all Americans was finally =
fulfilled.

So, if you haven't yet, please add your name as a proud health care reform =
co-signer today:

http://my.barackobama.com/cosigner2

Please accept my thanks for your voice, for your courage, and for your =
indispensable partnership in the great work of creating change.

History, and I, are in your debt.

President Barack Obama
