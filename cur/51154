Republican Congressman Slated to Oppose President Obama=B9s Health Care Pla=
n
Hooked on Health and Insurance Campaign Contributions

Washington, D.C. =AD Public Campaign Action Fund raised serious conflict of
interest questions about Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.) and the expected
opposing remarks he will deliver tonight in response to President Barack
Obama=B9s speech to a joint session of Congress on health care reform.

According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, Rep. Boustany
has received $1,256,056 from health and insurance interests since first
being elected in 2004. The total counts for more than 20 percent of all of
his fundraising.=20

=B3There is a conflict of interest when members of Congress stand before th=
e
public and recite the same talking points put forth by lobbyists and the
heads of insurance and HMO giants opposing health care legislation,=B2
commented David Donnelly, national campaigns director of Public Campaign
Action Fund. =B3Rep. Boustany has taken more than $160,000 in campaign
contributions from insurance and HMO interests alone. Do you think he=B9ll
disclose that to his national audience tonight? It=B9s time to end the mone=
y
chase and pass the Fair Elections Now Act.=B2

Introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and in the House
of Representatives by Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), the Fair Elections Now Ac=
t
(S.752, H.R.1826) would create a voluntary system of public financing that
provides candidates with a limited sum of public funds once they demonstrat=
e
broad community support. Candidates are also able to raise additional funds
in small amounts on top of the grant that are matched on a four to one
basis, up to a limit, and are eligible to receive media vouchers for
airtime. Because the system is voluntary and places no further restrictions
on those who choose not to participate, the law is constitutional.

Public Campaign Action Fund is a national nonprofit organization dedicated
to passing comprehensive public financing of elections and working to hold
elected officials accountable for the favors they give to special interest
donors.
