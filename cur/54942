Dear Colleagues,


I'm writing to let you know that I've decided to leave the Law Center. My l=
ast day in the office will be August 27.


Working at Georgetown Law has been a terrific experience, but after almost =
12 years, I'm looking forward to new adventures and taking some time for my=
self.


I've greatly enjoyed working with all of you over the years and wish you my=
 very best.


If you need anything, please contact the wonderful communications team at: =
communications@law.georgetown.edu


Fondly,

Elissa
