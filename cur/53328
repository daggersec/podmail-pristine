Dear John, 

From all of us at VoteVets.org, I wanted to wish you a very Happy New Year. 

Things are starting off great, because of all of your help. Just days ago, we saw Tammy Duckworth, Bill Enyart, and Tulsi Gabbard sworn in as members of Congress. Tammy and Tulsi are the first female combat veterans ever elected, so this was a truly historic day. 

On the Senate side, we saw the swearing in of Senator Jon Tester, Senator Claire McCaskill, Senator Sherrod Brown, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Senator Joe Donnelly and Senator Tim Kaine. That's six pro-Veteran Senators who will be there on Capitol Hill, because of your help! 

Last year, VoteVets.org was able to spend over $7 million dollars to make this all happen, and we were only able to be so active because of your incredible support. 

We are beginning to outline our plans for the next year - but before we talk to you about moving forward we wanted to take a moment and wish the very best to you and yours for 2013. 

As always, do not hesitate to call or email me, or Les MacDonald, with any questions, suggestions, or concerns. 

We will be in touch in the weeks to come! In the meantime, thank you again!! 

Sincerely, 

Jon
