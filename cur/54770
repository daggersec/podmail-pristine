Recovery going well.  Yesterday I got dressed for the first time out of
pajamas.   Today I did it again, in the same clothes as yesterday.  I am
getting around pretty well with my cane.  Today I switched to advil during
the day, and it was fine.  Tonight however I will be taking the real pain
stuff for bed. I showed the kids my staples which might not have been a
great idea..  Gabe was fairly horrified, though he did say he would try to
be more helpful when I ask.  Even Maribel didnt really want to look.  I
think they look pretty good, all 15 of them.

Bel's team won 2-0,, Gabe's team lost 4-1.  Tomorrow they both play again.
Nice that all games this weekend are in dublin.

Hope the wedding was fun.  And you are all enjoying the weekend.

xo
megan
