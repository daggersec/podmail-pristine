Mike & Co. --

Wheels are in motion on almost every major front right now in Congress, with=
 Paul Ryan announcing tonight that he is a to serve as a unity candidate for=
 Speaker, if all the major caucuses of the House Republican conference endor=
se him.  He is giving the conference until this Friday to decide whether it i=
s behind him.=20

Some key issues won't be addressed until a successor to Speaker Boehner has b=
een elected in November, others will necessarily be teed up if not resolved b=
efore then.=20

Meanwhile, the hearing schedule this week includes:

=E2=80=A2  Senate Budget on ideas for reforming the federal budget making pr=
ocess, tomorrow

=E2=80=A2  House Financial Services on housing finance reform, tomorrow=20

=E2=80=A2  House Transportation on the Highway Trust Fund reauthorization, T=
hursday (mark-up)  =20

Below, a review of the SEC nominations announced today.   In the days to fol=
low, the status of such issues as the debt limit increase, the CR extension,=
 and the Ex-Im and Highway Trust Fund reauthorizations.=20

Best,

-----------

Today, President Obama announced nominations of candidates to replace depart=
ing SEC Commissioners Luis Aguilar, whose term expired in June, and former D=
aniel Gallagher, who left the agency this month.

For the Aguilar seat, reserved for a Democrat, Obama nominated Lisa Fairfax,=
 a law school professor supported by allies of Sen. Elizabeth Warren who hav=
e wrangled with the White House over this position for several months.  Inve=
stor protection advocates pressured the administration to withdraw its initi=
al nominee for the job, a corporate lawyer who had represented pro-business g=
roups. =20

For Gallagher's Republican post, Obama has put forward the name of Hester Pe=
irce, a researcher at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. =20

Should these nominees be confirmed, it would be the first time a majority of=
 SEC Commissioners are women.  In fact, four out of five of the Commissioner=
s would be.   =20
Fairfax's research has focused on corporate governance,an increasingly conte=
ntious issue for the agency.  In February, she supported an Episcopalian chu=
rch's effort to rein in firearm sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc via a sharehold=
er proposal.

She was previously a professor at the University of Maryland law school and w=
orked at law firm Ropes & Gray.  She was recently named a member of the SEC i=
nvestor advisory committee, a panel of experts who make rulemaking recommend=
ations to the agency.  In May 2014, she hosted a conference that included of=
ficials from Public Citizen, Better Markets and the AFL-CIO.  Fairfax is a H=
arvard Law School graduate.

Hester Peirce, a researcher at the Mercatus Center at George Mason Universit=
y, would replace former SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher, who left the agen=
cy earlier this month.

Peirce has won applause from Republicans for her extensive research and crit=
icisms of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.  Her positions on financial regulation wi=
ll likely draw fire from Senate Democrats who have privately expressed conce=
rn with Peirce's views on Dodd-Frank.

Before Mercatus, Peirce was a banking committee staffer for Sen. Richard She=
lby during the drafting of Dodd-Frank.  She worked with the Republican SEC C=
ommissioner Michael Piwowar in 2011 when they were both Shelby staffers on t=
he Banking Committee.  Piwowar was the Republican economist.  Both of them w=
orked on the confirmation process for Gallagher and Commissioner Luis Aguila=
r in June 2011.

At the SEC, Peirce worked for Commissioner Paul Atkins. She also clerked for=
 Judge Roger B. Andewelt of the Court of Federal Claims in Washington.  She c=
urrently serves on the SEC's Investment Advisory Committee.

Sen. Schumer, a member of the Banking Committee that will vote on the nomina=
tions, said that one of the chief issues is whether the SEC will enact a rul=
e requiring public companies to disclose their political spending. =20
