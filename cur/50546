Can we point those who are writing to the 2013 video in which she supports
marriage equality from both a policy and legal standpoint to push back on
the point this is not a flip flop?

*Shifting Position, Clinton Says Gay Marriage Should Be a Constitutional
Right *

 Hillary Rodham Clinton=E2=80=99s campaign said on Wednesday that she hopes=
 that
the Supreme Court will make same-sex marriage a constitutional right,
reflecting a shift in her previous view that it is a decision that should
be left to the states.

 Adrienne Elrod, a spokeswoman for Hillary for America, said, =E2=80=9CHill=
ary
Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come
down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional
right.=E2=80=9D

 The statement reflects a further evolution in Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s views=
 on gay
marriage. Last year, during an interview with NPR, she said that she
supported the expansion of same-sex marriage rights on a state-by-state
basis.

 =E2=80=9CFor me, marriage had always been a matter left to the states,=E2=
=80=9D Mrs.
Clinton said, going on to explain that such a path of progress was working.

 The interview frustrated some in the gay community as Mrs. Clinton was
reluctant to say if she always believed that homosexuals should have the
right to marry or if her opinion changed since the 1990s when her husband,
President Bill Clinton, signed the Defense of Marriage Act.

 Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s shift comes ahead of a decision by the Supreme Cour=
t,
probably in June, on whether all 50 states must allow gay and lesbian
couples to marry.

 Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s campaign initially made the statement on Wednesday =
to
BuzzFeed news.
