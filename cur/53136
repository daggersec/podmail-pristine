Sandalow is prepared to take a leave of absence and step into the lead
for the Energy and environment policy group.  I think going forward a
strong team would be Sandalow and Joe Aldy - PhD economist from RFF  who
has been great (I have not spoken with him about a leave of absence).  I
assume one of the Heathers.  And then I would like to add two younger
folks who can just get things done - research, writing, etc.  One is a
campaign volunteer, served on the energy policy team, worked for the
Chicago mayor previously; is currently at McKinsey - he is of Indian
decent.  The other is  a woman lawyer at Latham that use to work for me;
she also did press at the State Department before going to law school.
She has done the background work for the energy and environment EO
proposals. =20

=20

That would give us a total of five - 3 men - one of color and 2 women.
Not sure how many need to get paid.  Let me know what you think. =20

Following up on the EPA conversation.  Frances is a very good idea -
particularly since "minding" our environmental friends will be
challenging.  Also the African American woman from NJ that we discussed
for EPA #2 was just named Corzine's  COS.  Although she is telling folks
her first hope is to be #1 at EPA.  Not sure she knows climate but could
get that expertise through the #2, e.g.  =20

Thanks, Carol
