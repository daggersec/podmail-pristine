John --

The President did something big last week.

He proposed a set of major reforms to help protect our
children and our communities by curbing gun violence, and
he's already announced 23 executive actions that will go a
long way in helping keep our kids safe.

This is an important start -- but I have no illusions about
what needs to be done and how difficult it will be.

Every step we intend to take will preserve the tradition of
responsible gun ownership in our country and uphold the
Second Amendment. And while we'll never end gun violence
entirely, if we can save the life of even one child, then
we have a responsibility to act.

This action includes not only what we can do, but what
Congress can do. To make a real and lasting difference,
they must act soon.=20

The President has called on Congress to act on four
specific legislative measures: closing background check
loopholes, banning military-style assault weapons and
limiting high-capacity ammunition magazines, making our
schools safer, and increasing access to mental health
services.

Read more about the President's plan to reduce gun
violence, and make sure you forward this to friends and
family:

http://my.barackobama.com/Gun-Reform

The President asked me to work with law enforcement,
teachers, parents, sportsmen, Democrats, Republicans, faith
leaders, mental health experts, and other organizations and
individuals to come up with a set of concrete policy
proposals. The plan he put forth is the product of those
conversations and recommendations.

Right now, President Obama is counting on you.

Each one of us needs to speak up and demand action. It
doesn't matter whether you live in a big city or a small
town like Newtown, Connecticut. When our fellow Americans
are victims of senseless violence, we all pull together as
one American family.

Let's get this done, folks.

Whether the action we take saves one life or 1,000, it
matters.

Thank you,

Joe
