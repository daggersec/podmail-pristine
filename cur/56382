**Guess what? Since this supporter put together this=20

If you like it, we ask that you share it with any friends, family=20

their mind about who to vote for (and everyone knows some).=20
All you have to do is pass it on -- forward it, share on Facebook,=20

Done. What else?

If you spot something that's especially persuasive or inspiring,=20

With 12 days to go in this election, and millions of voters still=20
