Dear Friend,

fuggedaboudit.jpg
Last night, Colorado's corrupt Secretary of State Scott Gessler
officially announced he is running for Governor of Colorado in 2014.

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DB8ygihYBKwk6-TcTcXRQyQ

Gessler as Governor would be a nightmare for Colorado. Click here to
donate to ProgressNow Colorado. Your gift will immediately be put to
work holding Gessler accountable in 2014

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3D4eqvRM1l7pkkOKb_0h5i_Q

.

Scott Gessler's time as Secretary of State has been a sad story of
incompetence and corruption. Gessler stepped into scandal almost
immediately after taking office, when he announced his intention to
"moonlight" for his former right-wing elections law firm. After a
public outcry, Gessler backed away from that horrible idea--but he
didn't stop there.

While Gessler spent enormous amounts of time and taxpayer money
unsuccessfully searching for so-called "illegal voters," his voter
registration systems failed and lost the registrations of hundreds of
legal voters. Gessler has consistently sought to make voting harder by
stopping mail ballots and purging so-called "inactive" legal voters.

Take a moment right now to make an investment to stop Scott Gessler
with your donation to ProgressNow Colorado.=A0

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DcfKX3uWTgNAlHDZyXxaQxA

Perhaps the worst of Gessler's misdeeds came to light just this
summer, when the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission determined
that Gessler had "violated the public trust for private gain" by
spending your taxpayer dollars to attend partisan political events
like the Republican National Convention. Gessler was fined the maximum
amount possible after the commission determined Gessler had used his
office's discretionary account as a slush fund to pursue his own
partisan agenda.

We at ProgressNow Colorado have spent more time holding Gessler
accountable since taking office than any other right-wing politician
in this state (and for good reason). Click here to donate and help us
double down on our efforts to hold Gessler accountable.

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3Dpw3q_FlV4yI9FYAXNLq-kg

We're on the ground right now telling the truth about Gessler's
record. We're not going to let Gessler get away with hiding from his
incompetence, double dealing partisanship, and outright corruption.

But we need your help! Donate now to say "no" to the "Honey Badger."

Amy Runyon-Harms
