John & David,

Obviously, the convention will provide a prime time for us to meet with fun=
ders for Progressive Accountability, since there will be so many old and ne=
w funders in attendance.  In particular,  I believe it provides a great opp=
ortunity to meet with new funders for whom this will be their first convent=
ion and consequently won't be invited to very many things.  These new major=
 funders will be looking for impressive things to come to and impressive pe=
ople to meet with.

Consequently, I think we should do two briefings --one from 2:00 to 3:30 on=
 Tuesday and one from 10:00 to 11:30 on Wednesday.  This will be super inex=
pensive to do.  We will the invited with a simple letter and do it in the s=
pace that Media Matters has reserved for the whole convention.  I am certai=
n these briefings will cost not more that a couple thousand dollars for cof=
fee and donuts so no worries about the cost.  These letters should go out t=
his week so I absolutely need sign-off on the times ASAP!

Additionally, I would like to schedule some individual meetings with large =
donors who wont come to the briefings and would like to have your availabil=
ity, John, as I already have David's.

The convention should be a great opportunity for us to kill many birds with=
 one stone.  but I must start scheduling now!!!!!


Thanks,

MP
