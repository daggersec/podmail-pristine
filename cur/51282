Chris,
We blew an engine on take off from Kigali. I now don't arrive back in
to the states until Thursday afternoon. I'll try to call from the
road, but I'm travelling thru Ethiopia so the chances of connecting
seem remote. Will you think about what we need to accomplish on Friday
on the call and what paper we'll need and I'll ck in when I hit the
ground Thursday.
John
