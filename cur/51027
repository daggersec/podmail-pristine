Matt - while on vacation I have given some thought to how I might publicly
express my support for HRC. Here is what I have come up with after a couple
of drafts. Let me know if something like this in an op-ed would be
helpful. If not, no problem as it has helped me craft an answer if asked
why I support her.

Here it is:

 On February 1, 2016 I intend to proudly caucus for Hillary Clinton. Here
are the reasons I support her to be our next President and our country's
first woman President.

Hillary Clinton is not new to the fight for middle class families.
Throughout her public life she has consistently fought to expand and
strengthen the middle class. I have no doubt she will continue that fight
as President.

Expanding and strengthening the middle class starts with quality jobs. To
often the discussion of good jobs fails to include the unique challenges
faced by rural Americans. Hillary Clinton understands that some of the
deepest and most pronounced poverty exists in rural areas of the country.
Her strong support for the Renewable Fuel standard and bio based
manufacturing as important parts of a revitalized rural economy indicates
to me that she will work hard to promote meaningful economic opportunity
throughout the country.

The economy  of the future will depend on a well educated and trained
workforce. Hillary Clinton realizes that the cost of education from
pre-school to college and beyond increasingly strains family budgets with
unprecedented cost and debt. She believes that government needs to play a
role in removing that strain and she has proposed a plan to make pre-school
more available and college more affordable . She will not quit on
any American seeking a better life through education and training.

Good paying jobs may not be enough for a family devastated by a serious
injury or illness. Hillary Clinton believes that every American has the
right to affordable healthcare. She knows that millions of Americans now
have an added layer of security by having access to health care insurance
under the Affordable Care Act.  She will preserve those protections and
look for ways to expand access to affordable health insurance coverage for
all Americans.

Good ideas and programs will not improve lives unless they are implemented.
A candidate has to win the election first before she can implement those
ideas as President. In a tight Presidential race experience and
resilience can be the difference between winning and losing. Hillary
Clinton brings to this Presidential race a unique blend of experience and
toughness forged from her participation in 3 presidential races and
hardened by her years in the harshest political limelight. She knows what
it takes and she is battle tested and ready.

Even good ideas and getting elected is not enough. As a former governor of
Iowa and now as a member of President Obama's cabinet I have been
privileged to observe and counsel presidents as they navigate the toughest
job on earth. The most successful presidents are those who can both lead
and govern. Leadership inspires. Governance delivers. As President, Hillary
Clinton will both inspire and deliver results. Iknow because I have worked
with her as a First Lady, a twice elected Senator, and most recently as her
colleague in President's Cabinet where she served as a distinguished
Secretary of State.

Hillary Clinton leads by example. Her courage in China when she declared
that "women's rights are human rights" has inspired women all over the
world to demand equality and freedom. As a Senator for New York she worked
with farmers to improve their prosperity in rural New York.  As Secretary
of State we established together a program called "Feed the Future" which
delivers food assistance to over 12 million hungary children in the poorest
countries in the world.

Effecting policy changes and progress toward improving lives in this
country and globally depends on the strength of relationships among
political, business and thought leaders. Having spent 8 years in the White
House, 8 years in the U.S. Senate and 4 years as Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton has established close working relationships with Congressional
leaders, governors and mayors, opinion makers and global leaders. No
candidate in the race can match Hillary Clinton's breadth and depth of
relationships from Main Street to Pennsylvania Avenue and in centers of
power around the world.

On a personal note Hillary Clinton is one of the most loyal people I know
and that is rare in politics. When I was elected governor of Iowa in 1998 I
met with President Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. In that private meeting
he gave me some very good advice. He encouraged me to stay true and loyal
to the ideas I ran on and to the people who had faith in me to govern well.

Hillary Clinton was one of those people.

My election that year was a surprise to many but not Hillary Clinton.
Despite the fact that I was way behind in the polls Hillary Clinton
encouraged people she knew from all over the country to invest in me when I
needed help especially in the last weeks of the campaign. Without her
personal involvement I may not have won. Why did she do it? Loyalty.
Hillary and Tom Bell,my brother-in-law, became friends in 1972 when they
worked together as staff members to the Congressional Watergate Hearings.
Long before she was a household name, Tom Bell told me how much he liked
and respected her.

Over the past 15 years I've come to like and respect her, too.

That is why I support her.

Hillary Clinton has the right policies to strengthen and expand the middle
class, is battle tested and is our party's strongest general election
candidate, and has the experience and relationships to lead  and govern
well. For all of those reasons and friendship  I will caucus for Hillary
Clinton on February 1, 2016.
