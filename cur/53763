Amanda,
Happy to do this. But this should be more than a Colorado piece.

 For context, Senators Kennedy and McCain and I worked very hard to pass
comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate in 2006. Hillary was very
supportive and a leader in these efforts. The legislation died in the
Republican controlled House despite the strong push from President Bush. We
tried again in 2007.

I do not know Senator's Sanders history on the matter, so it would be very
useful for our HRC team to get me a background piece on Bernie's activity
and votes over the years on comprehensive immigration reform. Then we can
draft an oped that is supportive of Secretary Clinton's approach to
immigration reform, and contrast her efforts to Bernie's. The piece can
then be used in other States, besides Colorado-e.g., Nevada, Texas,
Florida, etc.

Thank you.

Ken
