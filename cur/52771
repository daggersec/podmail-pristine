The problem, that Richard correctly articulates is  that those of us who 
are longtime advocates will know to opt out HOWEVER,  and this is a big 
however, Many Duals will be  captured by passive  enrollment by not understanding 
if they should opt out, or by confusing  notifications as they were in the 
SPD enrollment and for those on In Home  waivers and others who have fragile, 
complex and co-morbid conditions the  consequences can be grave as you know.
 Question: Are people on In Home waivers exempt?  If so, they will not need 
to opt out? Please clarify, and thanks. --  nancy 
 
In a message dated 1/11/2013 5:20:35 P.M. Pacific Standard Time, 


With the duals, a person has the absolute right to opt out for their  
Medicare. They don't have to have a reason or get anybody's  permission. 



That was also true of cancer patients to receive  MERs Medical Exemption 
Requests in the SPD transition to Mandatory  Medi-Cal Managed Care.  They also 
had a right they did not have to  prove, yet none the less, in practice, 
they were captured and often  after some were resourceful enough to make their 
way to legal aid lawyers  and after heavy lifting by those legal aid 
lawyers, many were STILL denied  exemptions.  And in cases where time can mean 
your life, as was the  case of the cancellation  of Anna Valdez's surgery to 
remove a  cancerous tumor and get the appropriate chemotherapy regimin, and 
others on  ventilators or mid treatment, and many other fragile conditions, 
delays  can be deadly.
 
In theory, this might be written.  In practice,  this is not what happened 
to some seniors and people with disabilites in the  past SPD enrollment by 
the Department of Healthcare Services, and Richard and  all the rest of us 
have no reason to rest easy that this will not occur in the  Duals transition, 
which is why it is good that the deadline was pushed  back.  And the large 
group that you fought so mightily with Deborah and  DRC and all the Consumer 
and Advocacy groups must insist that EVERY Senior or  Person with a 
Disability in the SPD transition must IN REALITY be receiving  appropriate care 
before ONE MORE Person is added to managed care in the Duals  Demonstraion 
pilot. No one person can be acceptable collateral damage of  mismanaged 
administration of these programs.
 
And at least in theory, the state is not going  to even offer enrollment to 
people on waivers. They should not receive any  enrollment materials. There 
will be no medical exemption request process  for the duals because of the 
right to opt out for Medicare.
