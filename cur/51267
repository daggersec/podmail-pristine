Dear John,

Election Day is exactly two weeks from today.

But right now, we're facing an urgent deadline that will determine exactly =
where we can compete -- and how fiercely -- in the final push.

On Friday morning, we have to make the final, hard decisions about =
deploying our resources. That means your support by Thursday at midnight =
is absolutely vital.

Your first donation of $10 or more will provide resources urgently needed =
before the deadline. And you'll receive a limited edition Obama-Biden car =
magnet:

https://donate.barackobama.com/deadlinemagnet2

Your support will determine how hard we can fight in key battleground =
states -- and if we can expand our operation into some newly-competitive =
states during the final days.

What began in Springfield, Illinois, more than 20 months ago will reach =
its peak on Tuesday, November 4th.

We know what we need to do to win.  But it's up to you if we have the =
resources to fight hard and expand our reach.

Make a $10 donation to support this campaign before Thursday at midnight =
and receive a limited edition Obama-Biden car magnet:

https://donate.barackobama.com/deadlinemagnet2

Thanks,

Obama for America
