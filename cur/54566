Friends:

546 days ago, I sent out an email with some exciting news: I was declaring
my candidacy for Mayor of Los Angeles.  I had no idea what the ensuing 18
months would bring or whether or not our campaign would prevail, but I was
driven by a strong sense of urgency about our city's future.  I felt then
that Los Angeles was not doing enough to realize its potential and that
government had to play a critical role in the revitalization and rebuilding
of a great city, as we were able to do in my district over the last decade.

We set about building an incredible campaign--one donation, one
conversation, one volunteer at a time.

More than 9,000 donors donated more than 11,000 times.  I visited all of
the 92 neighborhoods of Los Angeles and laid the foundation for a
successful grassroots campaign.  We started talking to voters two months
ahead of any other campaign and had thousands of volunteers talk to their
neighbors about the future of our city.  We developed and laid out
ambitious plans to put this city back to work.  We raised money, breaking
records for the number of donors, the speed of fundraising, and the most
raised in a single event.  We debated (over 40 times) and we listened and
we moved this campaign forward, earning the support of leaders, the LA
Times, and everyday residents like you.

On Tuesday night, the work we did paid off.  In the face of more than $3
million in unregulated money for my opponents, we drew upon our broad base
of support and upset the conventional wisdom, finishing in first place by
four points!

Now, the fun part begins--we need to raise in 74 days what we raised in a
year and a half.  It will be tough but rewarding work, and our internal
polling already has us ahead in the head-to-head matchup by more than 10
points.

I'm running out of the house now, but I need you to step up again and
donate.

This isn't being sent from a service.  I personally wrote this to my core
supporters and am pressing "send" myself.

Please consider the maximum amount ($1300/$2600 per couple) or the most
that you can give.  It WILL make the difference of whether we win or not.

Do it now at http://bit.ly/donateEric and share the link with friends.

I am so grateful and humbled to have your support.  I am more idealistic
today than when I first entered public service and more confident of our
victory in May with each growing day.  I couldn't have done this without
you.

Let's get this done.

My very best,

Eric

P.S. Here is the original message I sent out a year and a half ago:

-----Original Message-----
From: EM Garcetti **
Sent: Sep 8, 2011 8:55 AM
To: Eric Garcetti **, Amy Elaine Wakeland **
Cc: Stephanie Daily Smith **
Subject: some exciting news--it's official!

Dear friends and family:


I hope this message finds you all well.


I am personally sending this email to a hand-selected group of folks from
my personal email addresses to share some exciting news with you: today, I
am taking papers out to run to be the next mayor of Los Angeles.  Ten years
ago, I committed myself to pursue public service in the heart of one of
America's greatest cities.  Many of you donated, volunteered, walked
precincts, gave me advice, and we built an amazing campaign that defied the
odds and won.


The decade of service that followed has been incredible--we've transformed
neighborhoods and changed lives and we have seen our work recognized
locally and nationally as a model for safer, more livable, and more
prosperous communities.  You all probably get my email updates and read
every bit of them :), so I won't expand any further, but let me just say
thank you for being my support network, my extended family, and for all the
assistance you have offered in the past.


I know am I ready to be mayor.  I am ready to inspire this city, to lead it
out of tough times, to get Angelenos and Americans inspired again about
what is possible, and to make Los Angeles a model city once again.  After
talking through the decision with Amy and the rest of my family, my head
says we can win, my heart says this is the right time, and my gut says
let's go and build an unstoppable campaign.


The campaign will be played out over the next 18 months (the election is
March 5, 2013), but it is important to start now to make sure we win.  I
hope I can count on you in the months ahead.


"Eric, how can I help?" you ask?  Well, thanks for asking :) Let me tell
you what you can do (and all of this can be achieved on our web site
starting at 6:30pm Pacific Time today--we can't officially launch it any
earlier unfortunately due to campaign restrictions):


1) Donate: It is my goal in the next couple of weeks to show the strength
of my network--you--the most loyal, committed, creative, and experienced
friends a guy could hope to have.  I need to raise as much money as
possible as I launch this campaign.  While the 18 months until the March
2013 election will certainly be a marathon, I am hoping to quickly sprint
forward with a lot of financial momentum to show our campaign's strength.
 So, if you are able, *please donate* *today.*  The maximum donation is
$1000 per person ($2000 per couple if both sign the check) and every bit
helps.  Again, this can't be done electronically until about 6:30pm tonight
Pacific Time at www.ericgarcetti.com


2) Sign up: Go to www.ericgarcetti.com tonight or tomorrow morning and sign
up for campaign notices to keep up with what we are doing.  I promise not
to clutter up your inbox, but will communicate with meaningful ways to get
involved in the campaign and with updates on how the campaign is growing
and progressing.


3) Spread the word: I will rely on you to help this campaign grow.  Whether
it is a community leader, a future fundraiser or donor, someone who wants
to volunteer or an opinion-maker, let them know about this campaign and
about the work I have done as a councilmember.  I know we will have the
strongest, most diverse, most energetic group of supporters of anyone in
this race so please help build the buzz and build the network.  If there
are folks who you think I should call to join the campaign, send those
emails and phone numbers my way--I plan to spend a lot of time reaching out
to my friends' networks over the next months and I appreciate your help in
connecting me with other great folks.  For fundraising ideas and leads,
please email my extraordinary fundraising director, Stephanie Daily Smith
at dailysmith@gmail.com (she is also cced above).  For volunteers, please
send emails to info@ericgarcetti.com, and we will be in touch.

I'll be posting to my Facebook page(s) an announcement as well--and
cross-post or hit "like" if you are on Facebook when I do.


That's it for now--I just wanted you to know the news personally from me
before you heard about it elsewhere.


There will be many more ways to get involved in this campaign in the coming
months and I know that you will feel the same sense of optimism and
excitement that I do about this campaign and about Los Angeles' future.


Thanks for your friendship and support.  I'm lucky to have a group of
friends like you.  Here's to great days ahead.


Warmly,


Eric
