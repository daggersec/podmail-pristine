Ana-

I was expecting we'd already have it. But the goal is that Paul, John
and I have long plane rides across the country on Sunday evening so if
we could get the draft survey before we travel that would maximize our
ability to work on it. Can we try for COB today? Or, Sunday before
noon? I know we all agree it is really important the whole team spends
time on this since it is a $100K+ piece of research.

thanks,

Tom
