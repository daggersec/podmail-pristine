John --

Yep, me again. Surprise: I'm here to ask you for money.

Here's why: Tomorrow is our biggest fundraising deadline=20
yet, and I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask everyone=20
who is able to make a donation.

We just can't win without supporters like you pitching in what=20
you can, when you can -- we're facing too much special-interest=20
spending on the other side to keep up without everyone doing=20
their part.

Can you donate $3 or more before tomorrow night's deadline?

https://donate.barackobama.com/July-Deadline78

To be frank, we've gotten our behinds handed to us the past two=20
FEC deadlines by Mitt Romney and his crew. I'll refrain from sharing=20
how that really makes me feel.

But that hasn't stopped us from opening more offices, hiring more=20
field organizers, and reaching out to more voters. Ultimately, that's=20
what's going to deliver us a win in November -- and that's all thanks=20
to the 2.4 million grassroots donors like you who are building this=20
campaign.

It might sound crass, but ramping up our ground game to the level=20
it needs to be across the country takes cash -- a whole lot of it.

You know what to do. Chip in if you can, before tomorrow at midnight:

https://donate.barackobama.com/July-Deadline78

99 days left. Here we go.
