To the Members of the Law Center community:
=A0
As we begin this new academic year, I would like to bring to your attention=
 the "Reflections on Ferguson" discussion tomorrow, August 28 at 4:00 pm.=
=A0 You should have received an email from the University President's offic=
e yesterday informing you of this important event, which will feature Law P=
rofessors Paul Butler and Peter Edelman.

For those of you who cannot make the event in person at Gaston Hall on the =
Main Campus, we are setting up a webcast that can be viewed in room 520 of =
McDonough.=A0 In addition, for those of you who cannot attend either in per=
son or via the webcast (and I realize a number of the first year sections h=
ave mandatory meetings at this time), a recording of the event will be post=
ed on the website. =A0
=A0
As President DeGioia has written, this discussion will be an opportunity "t=
o reflect on our responsibilities - as individuals, as a university and as =
a nation - to seek justice and promote dignity." I thank  Professors Butler=
 and Edelman for participating in this conversation, and I hope you will co=
nsider watching the event, either in person, via the webcast in McDonough, =
or through the recording on the website.

Sincerely,
Bill
