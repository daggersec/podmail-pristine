Feel free to keep feeding to me.  I can reach out and get her plugged in.

I've not been in touch with Jonathan Silver, but perhaps Pete, Trevor, and
Ben have.  If not, I can reach out and connect him directly with one of
those guys who will be the co-coordinators of our Clean Energy and Climate
Change working group.

Thanks, Ed

Great to visit with you at 8.0 Clean Energy Summit. After we spoke I was on=
 the first red eye from hot, hot Vegas to refreshingly cool NY and have bee=

Hillary would be a great President! We all need to do our part to help her =
move this country forward. I like her plan to combat Climate Change - as do=
 many of our friends - as well as her position on Arctic Drilling. Thank go=
