As we watch in horror as violence in Israel and Palestine escalates and the=
re continues to be needless and senseless killings, we offer a prayer of lo=
ve, compassion and strength.=20

May Israelis and Palestinians find the love that resides deep in their hear=
ts and pulses through all of us, the love that cries to us from the loving =
energy of the universe to love the "Other," the "Stranger." This is a love =
that can be hard to access and find and yet it is a never-ending, all perva=
sive love that encourages and calls us to stand-up for the well-being of ea=
ch other, for the security of all, for justice for all, for peace. May the =
Israelis and Palestinians use this well-spring of love to overcome their fe=
ars and stand for a new future.=20

=20

May the Israelis and Palestinians find the compassion that lives in each pe=
rson but that is often suppressed in times of fear and anger and learn to a=
sk the questions that so many seem afraid to ask. What would cause a young =
man or woman to kill a stranger? What fear, what sorrow, what pain lurks in=
 the dark crevasses of their hearts? How can we begin to heal the pain, the=
 sorrow, the loss? Where can we start?=20

=20

May the Israelis and Palestinians access the strength that permeates the ro=
ots of Mother Earth and embolden them to demand a different future. To cros=
s divides and build bridges that flow with human beings coming together ope=
ning their hearts to each other with generosity and love and work together =
towards peace and reconciliation.=20

We bow our heads in sorrow, in grief, in angst and even in rage that innoce=
nt lives are being lost on all sides and pray for a healing and reconciliat=
ion.=20

So where did all this violence in Israel and Palestine come from? Where sha=
ll we start? If you want the big historical picture from 1880 to the presen=
t moment, you'll get two very different narratives depending on who is tell=
ing it. In my book "Embracing Israel/Palestine" [ http://www.tikkun.org/eip=
 ] I try to tell the story in a way that is sympathetic to each side, and c=
ritical of each side. The truth is that each side has at times been cruel a=
nd unreasonable toward the other.=20

But if you focus on the past few decades, the reality is that both people a=
re currently suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder--the Jewish peop=
le from the trauma of living as a homeless people for some 1700 years, many=
 in a Christian Europe that blamed us for killing their messiah/god or in M=
uslim countries in apartheid-like powerlessness, eventually culminating in =
the murder of one out of every three Jews alive at the time from 1939-1945;=
 and the Palestinian people from the Naqba or disaster of having 800,000 dr=
iven from their land in 1948 during Israel's war for independence and then =
those who remained being conquered in 1967 and living under Occupation or b=
lockade ever since for the past 48 years. While the Israeli army has been o=
ccupying the West Bank, what in 1948 was originally in 1948 800,000 Palesti=
nian refugees living in exile have grown to 4 million, many of them living =
in some of the worst conditions anywhere on the planet, often treated horri=
bly by the Arab countries where they live in refugee camps. Meanwhile, Isra=
el has provided economic and political incentives to Jewish Israelis to mov=
e to the West Bank, build settlements there that, under the protection of t=
he Israeli army, have seized Arab lands and expanded and appropriated the w=
ater resources while Arab Palestinians have had desperate water shortages. =
Many of them go not because they want to oppress Palestinians but because t=
hey can live in comfortable villas on the hills overlooking Palestinian vil=
lages in comfort they could not possibly afford elsewhere in Israel. But on=
ce there, most refuse to listen to the stories of Palestinian suffering, an=
d their role in sustaining that, instead, like most Israelis, stuck in the =
stories of past Jewish suffering, and seeing themselves as victims rather t=
han as perpetrators. PTSD clouds the vision of even the most decent among t=
hem.=20

Palestinians living within the borders of the pre-1967 Israel have been giv=
en equal rights legally, but de facto face discrimination in housing and em=
ployment while those living in the occupied West Bank face a de facto syste=
m of apartheid with housing in the settlements closed to Israeli Arab citiz=
ens, with special roads built for the Jewish settlers and prohibited to the=
 Arab residents, and with an army presence which responds to demonstrations=
 with systematic violence and a quasi-legal system which typically imprison=
s thousands of Palestinians without trial in what they call "administrative=
 detention." Israel claims to be a democracy, yet denies the West Bankers t=
he right to vote in Israeli elections but meanwhile imposes taxes and creat=
es laws for those over whom it has been ruling for the past 48 years.=20

While Israel signed the Oslo Accords which promised to end the Occupation i=
n five years, after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was murdered by a =
Jewish religious fanatic, the accord was de-facto gutted by Israel increasi=
ng the settlers from the 150,000 that lived there in 1993 to some 500,000 l=
iving there now. And every week the Israeli Army kills some Palestinians, o=
ften young teenagers protesting the Occupation.=20

This story is enough reason to understand why the Palestinian people have t=
wice risen in rebellion against the Occupation, yet these Intifadas, as the=
y are called in Arabic, only increased the denial of Palestinian human righ=
ts by Israelis. Israelis, many of them either survivors of the Holocaust or=
 the children of survivors, have been led by their government and by the do=
minant right-wing Zionist ideology, to see these rebellions as manifestatio=
ns of hatred toward Jews rather than as desperate measures by an oppressed =
people. So whereas Israeli violence against Palestinians has always been de=
scribed as legitimate acts of self-defense, every act of rebellion against =
an unjust occupier are called acts of terrorists.=20

Not that the Palestinian people have always had clean hands. Their refusal =
to allow Jews to come to Palestine in the years when Nazism was sweeping Eu=
rope, their ability to convince Arab states to use their oil-based influenc=
e to get the British occupiers of Palestine to set up a blockade against Je=
ws seeking refuge in Palestine not only before and during the second world =
war, but also from 1945-48 when hundreds of thousands of Jewish survivors o=
f Nazism were placed in refugee camps in Europe and prevented from coming t=
o Palestine, created a legacy of anger at the Palestinian people among Isra=
elis who were in those European refugee camps or had friends or relatives w=
ho went through that post-Holocaust experience. . And the assault on the ne=
wly proclaimed Jewish state by 7 surrounding Arab states seemed to have the=
 covert and sometimes overt support of sections of the Palestinian people, =
which contributed to the anger of Israelis at those who insisted that Jews =
had no right to a state of their own, even though Arabs had over a dozen Ar=
ab and Islamic states at the time.=20

The nationalist extremist section of the Zionist movement that had hoped th=
at Arabs would simply leave Palestine used the 1947-49 war to terrorize Pal=
estinian civilians, causing hundreds of thousands to flee for their safety,=
 while the Israel Army (IDF) forcibly removed at least another 80 to 100 th=
ousand Arabs from their homes. These Arab refugees were not allowed by Isra=
el to return to their homes, though most had not sought to hurt Israelis bu=
t only to flee to safety in surrounding Arab lands that was not available t=
o Israeli Jews who had no other place to flee. The guilt over this unusual =
and human-rights violating act of  in not allowing Palestinian non-combatan=
t civilians to return to their homes, thereby creating the Arab refugee pro=
blem, was transformed by Israelis into a refusal to listen to Palestinian s=
uffering lest it open the door to the demand for a "right of return" to Pal=
estinian homes, many of which had already been given to newly arriving Isra=
eli Holocaust-survivors. This denial of responsibility by Israel unleashed =
a hatred by Palestinians and their supporters around the world that had bee=
n much more narrowly based among Arabs before this development. When Palest=
inian refugees sought to take back some of their stolen farms or houses in =
the early 1950s, they were met with the armed might of the fledgling Israel=
i army in a special unit led by Ariel Sharon, and were described as Arab te=
rrorists.=20

When Israel opened its gates to hundreds of thousands of Jews who had been =
living in Arab states in the 1950s, it was flooded with people who brought =
with them a history of anger at Muslims for what they perceived to be the h=
atred and anti-Semitism that had shaped their experience of living under Ar=
ab rule. While I believe that experience was shaped in large part by the wa=
y the colonial powers set up the tensions between Arabs and Jews in North A=
frica and in Middle Eastern states in the years before the creation of Isra=
el, the actual experience of being a hated minority by these Sephardic or M=
itzrachi Jews from Muslim lands seemed to mesh well with the Zionists who c=
reated Israel and who had refused, once the fighting stopped in 1948, to al=
low Palestinians to return to their homes.=20

Yet from the standpoint of many Israelis, all this is ancient history, and =
Palestinians ought to have adjusted to life under Occupation. But that has =
not happened. Instead, Islamic fundamentalism spread among powerless and im=
poverished Palestinians, first in Gaza, and more recently among some in the=
 West Bank as well. The primary organization of fundamentalists, Hamas, has=
 never rescinded its commitment to eliminate the Jewish state, unlike the P=
alestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization that have =
over and over again proclaimed their willingness to live in peace with Isra=
el. In the past ten years, the Palestinian Authority has actively collabora=
ted with the Israeli security forces, for the most part succeeding in preve=
nting terrorists from using the West Bank as a launching pad for attacks on=
 Israel or even on the West Bank settlements.=20

In an act of deep cynicism, Israel withdrew from Gaza and refused to pass i=
ts military control over to the Palestinian Authority, knowing that Gaza wo=
uld thus fall into the hands of Hamas. Then, using the excuse of Hamas' rel=
entless opposition to the State of Israel, the right-wing governments of Is=
rael in the past ten years have used fear of these fundamentalists as their=
 excuse to continue to stir up anger at Arabs in general and Palestinians i=
n particular. And after pretending to want negotiations with the Palestinia=
ns during the Obama years, Israel kept on expanding its settlements in the =
West Bank, imposed a crippling blockade on Gaza, and then refused to honor =
the promise it had made to the Palestinian Authority to release Palestinian=
 prisoners in March of 2014. When 3 teenagers from the West Bank settlement=
s were kidnapped and brutally murdered, the Israeli government escalated it=
s harassment of Hamas supporters in the West Bank and killed some Gazan Ham=
as activists, which in turn precipitated Hamas responding with rocket attac=
ks on Israel which were thwarted by the US military's Protective Shield, wh=
ile Israeli devastated Gaza that summer, killing over 2400 Gazans and wound=
ing thousands more, and leaving tens of thousands more homeless. Yet from t=
he standpoint of the Israeli people, the intent of those rockets aimed at I=
sraeli cities was proof that if they could, Hamas would try to wipe them al=
l out--and that gave the Israeli Right a further legitimacy to escalate its=
 vilification of all Palestinians and allowed Israeli Prime Minister Netany=
ahu to win re-election in March of 2015 and to create the most Right-wing a=
nd racist coalition Israel has ever seen. Hamas thereby managed to restimul=
ate the deepest PTSD fears of the Israeli people for their own survival, wh=
ile Palestinians, suffering from their own PTSD, seemed unable to recognize=
 how much the terrorist acts of a few only managed to further confirm Israe=
li anger and support for more repressive policies.=20

It was in this context that a group of Israeli Jewish nationalist fundament=
alists decided to provoke a new struggle for control of the Temple Mount in=
 Jerusalem which is where one of Islam's holiest sites, the Al Asqa Mosque =
is located. Under agreements that Israel has made with the Islamic authorit=
ies, the Temple Mount has been under the control of Muslim religious leader=
s who prevent Jews and Christians who visit the Temple Mount to pray there.=
 Yet some of the settlers believe that they should reclaim that site and re=
build the ancient Jewish Temple and resume the daily sacrifices of animals =
prescribed in the Torah and abandoned when the Temple was destroyed in 70 C=
.E. So every year at the time of Jewish holidays some of them go to the Tem=
ple Mount to symbolically reclaim that space for Jewish nationalist religio=
us extremism. And in anticipation of this happening again, the Israeli gove=
rnment closed the Temple Mount to most Palestinian men under the age of fif=
ty, allowing a very small number to come to pray.=20

Why is this nationalist extremism and not simply a legitimate expression of=
 a religious yearning to return to the period two thousand years ago when J=
ews controlled that religious site? Because for the past many hundreds of y=
ears most orthodox authorities explicitly prohibit religious Jews from goin=
g to the Temple Mount at all, arguing that we do not know exactly where the=
 Holy of Holies of the Temple was located on that space, and that stepping =
into that space is forbidden by Torah law to anyone but the High Priest (a =
position which has been vacant for the past two thousand years). So the rea=
son why this group of nationalist fundamentalists goes up to the Temple Mou=
nt in large numbers on Succot is to provoke the Palestinians and to demonst=
rate the absolute powerlessness of the Palestinian people to even protect t=
heir own holy Islamic site. The response has been consistent and predictabl=
e: young Muslims throw rocks at these Jewish provocateurs, Israeli police t=
hen teargas the Muslim demonstrators, the Mosque is shut to Muslims and the=
 Palestinian people are once again humiliated and prevented from praying in=
 their holy mosque. To add to the tension, members of the Knesset held publ=
ic hearings about the status of the Temple Mount in which they publicized t=
he position of Right-wing settlers that the Temple Mount should revert to J=
ewish control and the Mosque should be shut.=20

Given all the rest of the story, it was not surprising (though deplorable) =
that some individual Palestinians would respond to this whole history, and =
then to the repression symbolized by the Israeli authorities preventing acc=
ess to many Palestinians to the Temple Mount, with acts of violence.=20

Acts of random violence and murders of some Israeli civilians by individual=
 Palestinians acting often on impulse, as deplorable and morally outrageous=
 as they are, were not unpredictable--in fact, many Israelis at this moment=
 wonder if they are only the first stage in yet another widespread Intifada=
. I hope not, because I don't want to see either Israelis or Palestinians k=
illed. Yet I can also understand (though not condone) the outrage of Palest=
inians to this whole history, and now to the greater repression facing Pale=
stinians as Prime Minister Netanyahu's government has given the ok to respo=
nd to Palestinians engaged in acts of rock throwing or other acts of violen=
ce by killing them. In the past week Palestinians living in East Jerusalem =
have faced systematic harassment and violence from police and the IDF calle=
d in to supplement police forces. And the government has encouraged Israeli=
s to carry firearms and to shoot people suspected of being on the verge of =
doing acts of violence. By and large Israelis have responded to these calls=
 with acts of vigilantism, and the situation might soon explode to deeper v=
iolence.=20

But I doubt if it will. The reality is that the Palestinian people on the W=
est Bank, and most Palestinians living in Israel, are well aware of the fut=
ility of armed struggle, and in any event most don't have arms even vaguely=
 sufficient to hold off the immense power of the Israeli army. The truth is=
 that the Palestinian people at the moment are largely a psychologically de=
feated people, lacking creative non-violent leadership,  and though some in=
dividuals are likely to continue random acts of violence, most observers th=
ink it unlikely that we will see anything like the level of response to the=
 occupation that characterized the intifadas of the past. Nor will we see w=
hat would be far more strategically smart: massive non-violent civil disobe=
dience by Palestinian citizens of Israel coordinated with similar non-viole=
nt resistance among the occupied West Bankers.=20

We who are spiritual progressives find ourselves in a similar position of p=
owerlessness. Yet as Cat Zavis' prayer (above) suggests, there is one thing=
 on our side: the abiding hunger of every human being to live in a world of=
 love and kindness and generosity. That yearning has not been totally defea=
ted among Israelis or Palestinians, and though this looks like a very dark =
time, it will emerge again, though that day may be several decades into the=
 future.=20

What will help that yearning emerge more fully in Israel and Palestine is i=
f it can first become a shaping force in Western societies. We, in the Unit=
ed States, have the blood of hundreds of thousands on our hands from the mu=
rder and displacement of Native Americans, slavery, Vietnam, and more recen=
tly from our war in Iraq that eventually virtually destroyed that country's=
 capacity to function and unleashed forces that now manifest as ISIS and ot=
her Islamic fundamentalist groups. It is our responsibility, and our opport=
unity to transcend the militarist approach to world problems, to reject the=
 strategy of domination and military/economic/cultural/diplomatic "power ov=
er" others as the alleged  path to homeland security ( a path that has been=
 used for the past 10,000 years and rarely yields peace and well-being, and=
 replace it with a strategy of generosity as manifested in the Network of S=
piritual Progressives' Global Marshall Plan [ http://www.tikkun.org/gmp ]. =
If there was a candidate for the President who was talking about this kind =
of approach and endorsing the strategy of generosity and the Global Marshal=
l Plan, the most loving and hopeful parts of most Americans would respond a=
nd that candidate would have a good chance of becoming the next president, =
or the next president after that!=20

It is only when such a development happens in the West in a real way, and W=
estern societies replace their attempts to dominate the world with attempts=
 to engage in a respectful and generous way with the world's population tha=
t there is the chance that we can help Israelis and Palestinians move close=
r to reconciliation of the heart. No political solution without that change=
 of heart is likely to last or be viable for any length of time.=20

And that is why it is so important for those who want a world of peace to e=
mbrace the Global Marshall Plan. Please download the full 32-page descripti=
on of it in the pamphlet you can get for free at www.tikkun.org/gmp [ http:=
//www.tikkun.org/gmp ]. And in the meantime, join with all of us in the rel=
igious and spiritual world who are praying for an end to the violence from =
both sides, and for a miraculous appearance of a new spirit of love and gen=
erosity.=20

To help make that happen, please not only pray with us, but join the Networ=
k of Spiritual Progressives at www.spiritualprogressives.org/join [ http://=
www.spiritualprogressives.org/join ] and help us get your local city counci=
l, state legislature, and elected Congressional reps (your Congressperson a=
nd your two senators) and any presidential candidate you support to endorse=
 the Network of Spiritual Progressives' version of the Global Marshall Plan=
. This is specifically what You can do, so don't say you didn't know what y=
ou could do, because this is concrete and possible for you to do!=20

As a religious Jew, I'm committed to the Torah injunction to not only love =
my neighbor as myself, but as the Torah goes on to say, "thou shalt love th=
e stranger/the Other: (in Hebrew, ve'ahavta la'ger) and to not oppress them=
. It is this commitment that made me write "Embracing Israel/Palestine" and=
 that makes me today pray for the well-being of both peoples recognizing th=
at the only real way to be pro-Israel is to also be pro-Palestine, and the =
only real way to be pro-Palestine is to be pro-Israel, because both peoples=
 well-being is intrinsically tied to the well-being of the other. And this =
is true for all of us, because our well-being as Americans or whatever your=

-like powerlessness, eventually culminating in the murder of one out of eve=

 during Israel's war for independence and then those who remained being con=
quered in 1967 and living under Occupation or blockade ever since for the p=

 in 1948 was originally in 1948 800,000 Palestinian refugees living in exil=

 political incentives to Jewish Israelis to move to the West Bank, build se=

 Arab lands and expanded and appropriated the water resources while Arab Pa=
lestinians have had desperate water shortages. Many of them go not because =
they want to oppress Palestinians but because they can live in comfortable =
villas on the hills overlooking Palestinian villages in comfort they could =
not possibly afford elsewhere in Israel. But once there, most refuse to lis=

 forcibly removed at least another 80 to 100 thousand Arabs from their home=

 though most had not sought to hurt Israelis but only to flee to safety in =
surrounding Arab lands that was not available to Israeli Jews who had no ot=
her place to flee. The guilt over this unusual and human-rights violating a=

y Israelis into a refusal to listen to Palestinian suffering lest it open t=

 Palestinians and their supporters around the world that had been much more=
 narrowly based among Arabs before this development. When Palestinian refug=

ending to want negotiations with the Palestinians during the Obama years, I=
srael kept on expanding its settlements in the West Bank, imposed a crippli=
ng blockade on Gaza, and then refused to honor the promise it had made to t=
he Palestinian Authority to release Palestinian prisoners in March of 2014.=
 When 3 teenagers from the West Bank settlements were kidnapped and brutall=
y murdered, the Israeli government escalated its harassment of Hamas suppor=
ters in the West Bank and killed some Gazan Hamas activists, which in turn =
precipitated Hamas responding with rocket attacks on Israel which were thwa=
rted by the US military's Protective Shield, while Israeli devastated Gaza =
that summer, killing over 2400 Gazans and wounding thousands more, and leav=
ing tens of thousands more homeless. Yet from the standpoint of the Israeli=
 people, the intent of those rockets aimed at Israeli cities was proof that=
 if they could, Hamas would try to wipe them all out--and that gave the Isr=
aeli Right a further legitimacy to escalate its vilification of all Palesti=
nians and allowed Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to win re-election in Ma=
rch of 2015 and to create the most Right-wing and racist coalition Israel h=
as ever seen. Hamas thereby managed to restimulate the deepest PTSD fears o=
f the Israeli people for their own survival, while Palestinians, suffering =
from their own PTSD, seemed unable to recognize how much the terrorist acts=
 of a few only managed to further confirm Israeli anger and support for mor=
e repressive policies. </span></span><span style=3D"font-size:15.0pt;font-f=

a group of Israeli Jewish nationalist&#160; fundamentalists decided to prov=
oke a new struggle for control of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem which is wh=
ere one of Islam's holiest sites, the Al Asqa Mosque is located. Under agre=
ements that Israel has made with the Islamic authorities, the Temple Mount =
has been under the control of Muslim religious leaders who prevent Jews and=
 Christians who visit the Temple Mount to pray there. Yet some of the settl=
ers believe that they should reclaim that site and rebuild the ancient Jewi=
sh Temple and resume the daily sacrifices of animals prescribed in the Tora=
h and abandoned when the Temple was destroyed in 70 C.E. So every year at t=
he time of Jewish holidays some of them go to the Temple Mount to symbolica=
lly reclaim that space for Jewish nationalist religious extremism. And in a=
nticipation of this happening again, the Israeli government closed the Temp=
le Mount to most Palestinian men under the age of fifty, allowing a very sm=
all number to come to pray.</span></span><span style=3D"font-size:15.0pt;fo=

emism and not simply a legitimate expression of a religious yearning to ret=
urn to the period two thousand years ago when Jews controlled that religiou=
s site? Because for the past many hundreds of years most orthodox authoriti=
es explicitly prohibit religious Jews from going to the Temple Mount at all=
, arguing that we do not know exactly where the Holy of Holies of the Templ=
e was located on that space, and that stepping into that space is forbidden=
 by Torah law to anyone but the High Priest (a position which has been vaca=
nt for the past two thousand years). So the reason why this group of nation=
alist fundamentalists goes up to the Temple Mount in large numbers on Succo=
t is to provoke the Palestinians and to demonstrate the absolute powerlessn=
ess of the Palestinian people to even protect their own holy Islamic site. =
The response has been consistent and predictable: young Muslims throw rocks=
 at these Jewish provocateurs, Israeli police then teargas the Muslim demon=
strators, the Mosque is shut to Muslims and the Palestinian people are once=
 again humiliated and prevented from praying in their holy mosque. To add t=
o the tension, members of the Knesset held public hearings about the status=
 of the Temple Mount in which they publicized the position of Right-wing se=
ttlers that the Temple Mount should revert to Jewish control and the Mosque=
 should be shut.</span></span><span style=3D"font-size:15.0pt;font-family:G=

 first stage in yet another widespread Intifada. I hope not, because I don'=

tand (though not condone) the outrage of Palestinians to this whole history=
, and now to the greater repression facing Palestinians as Prime Minister N=
etanyahu's government has given the ok to respond to Palestinians engaged i=
n acts of rock throwing or other acts of violence by killing them. In the p=
ast week Palestinians living in East Jerusalem have faced systematic harass=
ment and violence from police and the IDF called in to supplement police fo=
rces. And the government has encouraged Israelis to carry firearms and to s=
hoot people suspected of being on the verge of doing acts of violence. By a=

immense power of the Israeli army. The truth is that the Palestinian people=
 at the moment are largely a psychologically defeated people, lacking creat=

 continue random acts of violence, most observers think it unlikely that we=
 will see anything like the level of response to the occupation that charac=
