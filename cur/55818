Hi Gara--

This is Eryn on John's gmail, relaying a message.  Do you mean Tuesday
night the 14th? If so, John can do it but needs to reasonably leave for SFO
by 9:30 pm PTO make the red eye.

If this dinner is on Sunday the 12th though, John won't be able to make it.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Eryn
