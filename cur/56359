al
eastern Kentucky, where poverty is worse among women than men. The Arizona
senator said he was familiar with the disparity but that there are better w=
ays
to help women find better paying jobs. &#39;They need the education and tra=

particularly since more and more women are heads of their households, as mu=

  QUESTIONER: Thank you. I was wondering, Senator McCain, why, um, when you=
 had the opportunity<span>to</span> vote <span>to</span> give <span>equal</=
span> rights <span>to</span> women, <span>equal</span> <span>pay</span>, I =
was wondering why you didn&#39;t show up <span>to</span> vote and you said =
that if you did, you wouldn&#39;t support it?<br>

<br>JOHN MCCAIN: I think you&#39;re referring <span>to</span> a vote recent=
ly that would&#39;ve allowed, which would&#39;ve eliminated the statute of =
limitations on lawsuits of, for charges or allegations of discrimination. U=
h, I think that if you eliminate the statute of limitations and make it, uh=
, unending then you may be violating the rights of the individual who&#39;s=
 being sued as well, whether they be a man or a woman. So, I believe that t=
he Supreme Court&#39;s decision was correct, that there is a statute of lim=
itations as, as <span>to</span> when charges or allegations or legal means =
are taken, uh, and<b> I believe that it was a correct decision of the Unite=
d States Supreme Court and I don&#39;t believe that this would do anything =
<span>to</span> help the rights of women except maybe help <span>trial</spa=
n> <span>lawyers</span></b> and others in that profession. And that&#39;s m=
y<span>view</span>. [applause]. If you&#39;d like <span>to</span> follow up=
, I&#39;d be glad <span>to</span> hear your response <span>to</span> that. =
