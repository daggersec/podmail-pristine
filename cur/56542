*Likable Enough? Clinton=E2=80=99s Exaggerated Favorability Problem*

JULY 28, 2015

Brendan Nyhan

Is Hillary Rodham Clinton
<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/13/us/elections/hillary-clinton=
.html?inline=3Dnyt-per>
in trouble? You would think so from the coverage of recent polls showing
that her unfavorable
<http://www.gallup.com/poll/184346/sanders-surges-clinton-sags-favorability=
.aspx>
ratings
<https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2179399-cnn-orc-poll-2016-election=
-9-a-m-july-26-2015.html>
have increased nationally and in key
<http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-=
presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?ReleaseID=3D2261>
states
<http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/nbc-marist-polls-show-donald-trump-r=
unning-strong-iowa-nh-n398401>
.

Multiple media outlets and pundits have suggested that her personal
unpopularity well over a year before the presidential election is a major
problem for her. A Washington Post article
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2015/07/27/four-poll-number=
s-to-make-hillary-clinton-sweat/>
described the poll numbers as =E2=80=9Cdecidedly sobering for Hillary Clint=
on=E2=80=99s
presidential prospects in 2016.=E2=80=9D

The underlying theory is, as The Post piece put it, that =E2=80=9Cpresident=
ial
politics tends to be dominated by personality=E2=80=9D and that Mrs. Clinto=
n =E2=80=9Cmay
be hard pressed to win a traditional presidential election in which
likability matters most.=E2=80=9D Likewise, a Los Angeles Times article
<http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-clinton-likability-20150727-story.html=
#page=3D1>
approvingly cited the maxim that =E2=80=9Cit=E2=80=99s often said that elec=
tions can boil
down to a contest of who would a voter rather have a beer with.=E2=80=9D

None of these claims are supported by the data.

The Huffington Post Pollster average shows that Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s
favorable/unfavorable
ratings
<http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/hillary-clinton-favorable-rat=
ing#%21mindate=3D2014-01-01&partisanship=3DN&estimate=3Dcustom&hiddenpollst=
ers=3Dppp-d,morning-consult,saint-leo-university,politico-penn-schoen-berla=
nd,harris-internet,clarity-dnew-republic,ppp-d,rasmussen>
at the national level have not changed as drastically as the coverage
suggests. They averaged 47 percent favorable/45 percent unfavorable in
January and are at 44 percent favorable/48 percent unfavorable now =E2=80=
=94 a
relatively modest shift given the onslaught of negative coverage she
received during the controversies over her use of private email and
donations to the Clinton Foundation. (As I explained
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/upshot/a-15-minimum-wage-but-why-just-fo=
r-fast-food-workers.html?rref=3Dupshot>
last year and as Chris Cillizza, author of the Post article, notes, Mrs.
Clinton=E2=80=99s ratings were always going to decline as she returned to t=
he
partisan fray after serving as secretary of state.)

Candidate perceptions are not a good predictor
<http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/youre-likable-enough-mit=
t/>
of the ultimate election outcome, especially this early. In April 1992, for
instance, a Gallup poll found that Bill Clinton=E2=80=99s ratings were 34 p=
ercent
favorable and 47 percent unfavorable, but he went on to defeat George H.W.
Bush by more than five percentage points in the popular vote seven months
later. By contrast, even though an April 2008 Gallup poll found that 60
percent of Americans had a favorable view of John McCain, he ended up
losing to Barack Obama by more than seven percentage points.

While it might seem obvious that people vote for the candidate they like
best, that notion often gets the direction of causality backward. In the
heat of the campaign, we ultimately tend to find reasons to support
candidates who share our party affiliation or seem to have a good record in
office (and to oppose candidates who do not). One way people do this, as
the George Washington University political scientist John Sides notes
<http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/romneys-empathy-gap/>,
is by focusing on the positive aspects of candidates they are inclined to
support (Mitt Romney=E2=80=99s management experience) and playing down any =
less
appealing aspects (his likability).

Of course, it=E2=80=99s easy to imagine unattractive candidates who could d=
amage a
presidential ticket. But the parties will go to great lengths to prevent a
candidate like Donald Trump from winning the nomination. The candidates who
actually contest general elections tend to be relatively evenly matched.

Could Mrs. Clinton lose? Of course! But it=E2=80=99s far too soon
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/upshot/fight-the-temptation-to-pay-atten=
tion-to-polls.html?rref=3Dupshot&abt=3D0002&abg=3D1>
to know, especially given the powerful effect that the state of the economy
next year will have on the eventual outcome. At this point, I=E2=80=99d loo=
k
to the betting
markets <http://www.predictwise.com/politics/2016president>, which put
Democrats=E2=80=99 chances of retaining the presidency at approximately 60 =
percent.
People with real money on the line seem to have a more favorable view of
her odds in 2016.

*Correction: July 29, 2015 *

An earlier version of this article misstated the time before the
presidential election. It is in less than 16 months, not 20 months.
