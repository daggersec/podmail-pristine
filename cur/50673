&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I hope that you are very well &amp; that this finds you smiling. I=
t has been quite some time since we&#39;ve caught up, but I am reaching out=
 and wondering where we can connect when I&#39;ll be in DC at the end of ne=

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Apologies for writing out of the blue, but recent personal tragedy=
 has me acting more boldly than usual and also questioning just about every=
thing. (Our baby daughter died on Thanksgiving when she was just four days =
