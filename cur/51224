This reservation is based on information you have provided
Hertz, including information regarding your current
geographic location.  Hertz reserves the right to demand
proof of what you have told us.  In particular, if you have
indicated that you are located outside your country of
residence,  you may, at the time of rental, be required to
prove where you were when this reservation was made,
through evidence such as an air or rail carrier ticket
receipt, a hotel bill or a utility bill addressed to you at
the location where you say you were.  Failure to provide
such substantiation may invalidate the rates you have been
quoted, or invalidate the entire reservation.  Providing
false information to Hertz in connection with this
reservation would also breach your rental agreement and
could violate the law.
