Robby will get the memo out today.

Campion is good to move to anytime in the 2pm hr when you return--he'll
have his cell on.

Kwan & Tierney moved to tomorrow.

I just came from NSIP's China Logistics briefing.  By 2:30 pm today we aim
to have you:
1) Briefing schedule for the week (and what docs to expect before)
2) Current tentative China schedule
3) Table of Contents for the Briefing Book that will be available as early
as Wednesday.  Final version done Thursday afternoon.
--Also, if you need to bring it up with HRC, I just found out we're
strongly discouraged from taking personal phones.  If you want Robby's
folks to get you a burner (or reimburse), let me know, and we can get on
that today.  Most worrisome item is contacts/emails being gleaned from
personal devices.
