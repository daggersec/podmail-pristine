Dear Members of the Georgetown University Community:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It is with great sadness that I share that Rabbi Harold S. White, a beloved member of our community since 1968, has passed away.&nbsp; As the first full-time rabbi appointed to a campus ministry position at a Catholic university in the United States, Rabbi White made an indelible impact as a caring mentor, teacher, interfaith leader and friend.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Over the course of his nearly 50 years here, his accomplishments were many: he taught and counseled countless students from across faith traditions; he led our celebrations of the High Holy Days in Gaston Hall; and he worked to enhance our academic offerings focused on Judaism, including helping to create the Program for Jewish Civilization in 2004 and championing it since.&nbsp; He often spoke of his pride in working at a Catholic university that fostered interfaith dialogue and sent many graduates to the Rabbinate.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Rabbi White also worked tirelessly to build bridges among faiths and communities at Georgetown and beyond.&nbsp; Deeply committed to interfaith understanding, Rabbi White co-taught a popular course with Fr. Dennis McManus and Imam Yahya Hendi centered on dialogue among Abrahamic faiths.&nbsp; The course once included a trip to the Holy Land, which allowed participants to engage with interfaith efforts through diverse partnerships that Rabbi White and other Georgetown colleagues helped to establish.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Rabbi White&rsquo;s devotion to our shared values and our mission as a community was unparalleled.&nbsp; His leadership and vision in creating opportunities for dialogue strengthened our community and helped build the ethos of engagement that characterizes our campus ministry today.&nbsp; His accomplishments are a testament to the lasting impact he has had on Jewish life here at Georgetown; he will be deeply missed by our entire University community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prior to coming to Georgetown,&nbsp;Rabbi White&nbsp;served Jewish communities in Dublin, Ireland and Ann Arbor, Michigan and across the Washington, D.C. area. &nbsp;He also served as a chaplain for the United States Navy.&nbsp; He completed his undergraduate degree at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut&mdash;his home state&mdash;and received his rabbinical ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We are deeply saddened by his passing and are planning a University memorial service to celebrate his life and his extraordinary contributions to our community.&nbsp; We will share further details in the days ahead.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please join me in expressing our deepest condolences to Rabbi White&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; I invite you to share a memory, photo or message of sympathy on <a href="http://links.georgetown.mkt6170.com/ctt?kn=1&ms=MjMzOTY3MTYS1&r=NzI1MzAzODY0NzES1&b=0&j=NjQwMDA2NTMyS0&mt=1&rt=0" name="Hyperlink_20150831_165527001" target="_blank" >our memorial webpage</a>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
May his memory be for a blessing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Sincerely,<br />
John J. DeGioia<br />
