Dear John,

Women's equality got a big win Tuesday in Mississippi, when voters firmly r=
ejected the far-right's attempt to end almost all reproductive rights.

But this struggle isn't over yet =E2=80=93 not by a long shot.

The terrifying measure in Mississippi would have outlawed abortion even to =
save the life of a mother. And it could have criminalized in vitro fertiliz=
ation, miscarriages, and some forms of contraception =E2=80=93 including IU=
Ds.

It would have taken us back to the 1950s =E2=80=93 and the voters overwhelm=
ingly said no.

But Republicans in Congress aren't listening. They've already introduced th=
ree bills copying the Mississippi law, and 63 Republicans have already beco=
me co-sponsors.

We can't let them take this radical agenda for inequality any further. Join=
 me and EMILY's List right away to say NO to the far-right's attacks on wom=
en's health.

Click here to sign our letter telling the Republicans in Congress to stop t=
he attacks on women's health. Make sure they know that voters will not acce=
pt their attempts to end women's reproductive rights.

We are going to deliver the signatures to the Republican leadership next we=
ek, so I need you to sign on immediately. The far-right Republicans need to=
 know that the voters have spoken =E2=80=93 and that they said no to this d=
isgusting piece of legislation.

The far-right isn't going to back down without a fight, and too many women =
are counting on us.
