Project New West Subscribers,

=20=20

We are happy to announce that Dave Contarino, former chief of staff and P=
residential campaign manager to Governor Bill Richardson, has joined PNW'=
s consulting team on the independent side.

=20

There is probably no other Democratic strategist in New Mexico who is mor=
e seasoned and able to provide subscribers with message development, targ=
eting, media buying, and general strategic assistance in communications a=
ct ivies than Dave.

=20

As a PNW consultant, he will assist in the development and analysis of al=
l research instruments and be available to subscribers to help create str=
ategic paid communications plans.

=20

As we all know, New Mexico will be a key battleground in this Presidentia=
l campaign.  Furthermore, there are critically important Congressional ra=
ces--including a US Senate race and three open seats for Congress.  We sh=
ould endeavor to coordinate our efforts to maximize our efficiency and mi=
nimize confusion and overlap in our efforts in all of these races. Finall=
y, every seat in the New Mexico Legislature is up for election. Dave can =
be very helpful in advising on paid media efforts to ensure we are compli=
menting and supporting each other's work.

Dave Contarino can be reached at davecontarino@gbr.mailstreet.com

Feel free to contact me with questions.
