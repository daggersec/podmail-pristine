ecially the student, to doubt our historic commitment to individual acts of=
 conscience and freedom of speech, and I vow to do better in the future. Th=

 focus, and I am committed to ensuring that all faculty, staff, and student=

 presence of the Siwash name and paraphernalia, the seeming invisibility at=
 Knox of the important issues raised by the events in Ferguson and other ci=
ties, and the desire for more opportunities for engagement with issues of d=
iversity and inclusivity. I regret any instances of disrespect and hurt tha=
t some in our community have experienced, and pledge fully to investigate a=
ll reports of insensitivity and discrimination. At the forum, and in the Kn=

>=20

 of the faculty addressing how to build an inclusive classroom. Even before=
 the Ferguson decision, faculty and staff began thinking of how best to add=

 the occasion of the week of the MLK convocation. And the Knox community ga=
thered a second time this week to discuss the Staten Island grand jury deci=
sion, while faculty have come together this December to read and discuss Wh=
istling Vivaldi, which explores the influence of stereotypes on campuses. I=
ntergroup Dialogue will continue and, in addition, we are committed to iden=
tifying new ways to better understand and value each other and to encourage=
 open dialogue on important and timely societal issues. Plans are also unde=
rway for  additional workshops on diversity and inclusivity for faculty and=
 staff, and we will work with the Campus Diversity Committee, Student Senat=
e, and faculty, staff and students who have expertise on these matters as w=
e move forward. As always, I welcome feedback and input from the campus com=
munity on additional ways we can address the concerns brought to my attenti=
on over my time on campus and especially over the past week.
>=20

tical thinking and engagement are on display and tested. It provides us wit=
h the opportunity to take a deeper look at who we are and who we want to be=
 as individuals and as a community. This conversation will continue both on=
line and face-to-face, and I encourage you to take advantage of the opportu=
nity to engage in those conversations openly and respectfully. I very much =
look forward to the return of our students in January so that these convers=
ations, sharing of perspectives, and community growth can continue.

and inclusivity for faculty and staff, and we will work with the Campus Div=

expertise on these matters as we move forward. As always, I welcome feedbac=

 critical thinking and engagement are on display and tested. It provides us=
 with the opportunity to take a deeper look at who we are and who we want t=
