Hope your travels are going well.  (Can you believe that Washington Post
Peter Baker story on the Clinton Campaign-who is talking and why do they
think this helps.)  Anyway, I've given it some thought, and I really
want to transition from HRC campaign to focus on how to help maintain
the high participation of minority voters, especially Latinos  in
November.  Unfortunately, I can't do it for free-I am already on too
many nonprofit/non-paying boards-so I would like to get paid for my
assistance.  Let me know what the next steps are-and how I should
proceed.  I told Christopher about your NASCAR analogy and he groaned as
he agreed, given our party, it's more likely someone is going to crash
into the spectator stands-what an image.  Be in touch, Maria
