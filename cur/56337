USDA Announces $9 Million to Support Community Food Projects Program

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Institute of Food and =
Agriculture (NIFA) announced the availability of $9 million in funding to a=
ssist low-income individuals and communities in developing local and indepe=
ndent food systems. NIFA is funding the grants through the Community Food P=
rojects program (CFP), authorized by the Agricultural Act of 2014 (Farm Bil=
l).

"Community Foods Projects provide the opportunity for low-income communitie=
s to become more self-reliant and take control of their own food systems," =
said Sonny Ramaswamy, NIFA director. "These projects create food systems th=
at are economically equitable and socially and environmentally sustainable,=
 providing real solutions for communities most in need."

Community Food Projects involve the entire food system. Projects assess str=
engths and establish connections among existing food systems, resulting in =
improved food systems that support self-reliance.

Grants are intended to help eligible, private, nonprofit entities in need o=
f a one-time installment of federal assistance to establish and carry out m=
ultipurpose community food projects. Projects are funded from $10,000 to $3=
00,000 and up to 36 months. All grants require a dollar-for-dollar match in=
 resources.

Applications are due March 17, 2015. Please see the request for application=
s for specific program requirements: http://www.nifa.usda.gov/fo/communityf=
oodprojects.cfm

CFP is an important part of USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiat=
ive, which works to strengthen and support local and regional food systems.=
 More information on the initiative, including an interactive map of CFP an=
d other federally-supported local food projects, can be found at: http://ww=
w.usda.gov/knowyourfarmer.The primary goals of the Community Food Projects =
program are to (1) meet the food needs of low-income individuals; (2) incre=
ase the food self-reliance of low-income communities; (3) promote comprehen=
sive responses to local food, farm and nutrition issues; and (4) meet speci=
fic state, local or neighborhood food and agricultural needs, including nee=
ds relating to infrastructure improvement and development, planning for lon=
g-term solutions and the creation of innovative marketing activities that m=
utually benefit agricultural producers and low-income consumers.

Since 2009, NIFA has provided more than $28 million to 154 Community Food P=
roject awards in 48 states to help communities improve access to healthy, l=
ocal food. Past projects include Philadelphia Green, which supports small-s=
cale growers in their efforts to bring fresh, locally grown produce to the =
Philadelphia metro area, and RootDown LA, which is engaging Los Angeles-are=
a youth in community gardens.

Funding for the CFP program is authorized by the 2014 Farm Bill. The Farm B=
ill builds on historic economic gains in rural America over the past six ye=
ars, while achieving meaningful reform and billions of dollars in savings f=
or taxpayers. Since enactment, USDA has made significant progress to implem=
ent each provision of this critical legislation, including providing disast=
er relief to farmers and ranchers; strengthening risk management tools; exp=
anding access to rural credit; funding critical research; establishing inno=
vative public-private conservation partnerships; developing new markets for=
 rural-made products; and investing in infrastructure, housing and communit=
y facilities to help improve quality of life in rural America. For more inf=
ormation, visit http://www.usda.gov/farmbill.=20

Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and extensio=
n programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issue=
s impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future. More information =
