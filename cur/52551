All - In preparation for the possibility that the State Department may ackn=
owledge as soon as today that there were 16 Sid emails missing from the 55k=
 pages of material produced by HRC, I wanted to circulate the below draft p=
lan for responding to the inquiries that Nick will get. Thanks.


Q: The State Department says that at least 16 of the emails that Sid Blumen=
thal turned over to the Benghazi Select Committee were not included in the =
55,000 pages of materials produced by Hillary Clinton. Doesn't this prove t=
hat Hillary Clinton deleted certain emails at some point before producing t=
hem to the Department?

ON-THE-RECORD RESPONSE FROM SPOKESMAN NICK MERRILL:

"Hillary Clinton has turned over 55,000 pages of materials to the State Dep=
artment, including all emails in her possession from Mr. Blumenthal."

ADDITIONAL POINTS ON BACKGROUND FROM CLINTON AIDE:

Not only did Clinton turn over all emails that she has from Blumenthal, she=
 actually turned over more than a dozen emails that were not included in wh=
at Mr. Blumenthal handed over to the House committee.

We do not have a record of other correspondence between Mrs. Clinton and Mr=
. Blumenthal beyond that which was turned over to the State Department. In =
terms of the documents provided by Mr. Blumenthal to the House committee, w=
e do not recognize many of those materials and cannot speak to their origin=
.

OFF RECORD, if pressed on whether we are essentially admitting the possibil=
ity that she deleted some emails:

Look, we do not know what these materials are, or where they came from. Jus=
t take a look at them: many of the documents are not even formatted as emai=
ls.

For all we know, it could be that, in the course of reproducing his emails =
after his account was hacked, Sid misremembered which memos he actually for=
warded to her and which he did not.

And hey, even if Sid is right and some of these documents were at some poin=
t sent to Clinton, this is unremarkable anyway for two key reasons:

One, she would have been under no obligation to preserve them since Blument=
hal wasn't a government employee.

Two, there is nothing in any of these emails that is remotely new or intere=
sting. Indeed, none of these 16 emails are qualtitatively different than th=
e dozens of others that Hillary already produced to the State Department. S=
o it is completely ridiculous to suggest that there might have been any nef=
arious basis for her to want to delete any of Sid's correspondence.
