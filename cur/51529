*ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE EIGHT YEARS AGO?*

The Bush years have been worse economically for middle class Americans by
nearly every measure.  McCain will continue these same failed Bush policies
that made the economy worse for middle class Americans over the last eight
years.

The Misery Index is simply the combination of the unemployment rate and the
inflation rate. It reached 11.3 percent in July. While still well below its

American economy lost 84,000 jobs in August, and the employment rate jumped
to 6.1%, the highest in five years.

Six years later, the Bush administration's consistent belief that deficits
don't matter has increased the national debt to over $10
trillion<http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/10/national_d=

A significant reason for the current $9.6 trillion federal
debt<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=3D20601103&sid=3DanJ4Egj1nXS8&r=
efer=3Dnews>has
been the Iraq War. And while the Bush administration has been spending
$12
billion a month<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/03/19/iraq-casualties-ir=
aq-cos_n_92303.html>in
Iraq, it's also been cutting taxes. The Center for Budget Policy and
Priorities (CBPP) says Bush's tax cuts accounted for 42% of the "
unprecedented <http://www.cbpp.org/9-12-08bud.htm>" explosion of the defici=
t
in recent years, which of course adds to the debt. The total cost of the
full cuts amounts to about $400 billion per
year<http://www.cbpp.org/1-31-07tax.htm>.
