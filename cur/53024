I'm happy to do it, but probably more authoritative coming from John.  =
Your last point is a very good one -- if labor thinks we've made =
decisions already, they're going to be mad, since we specifically told =
them that we weren't making any decisions until we had a chance to sit =
down with them after Election Day.

Chris/Podesta,=20

=20

Ceci Connolly and Jeff Smith are writing for Sunday that we've got a =
list of regulations ready to repeal.   See below.  =20

=20

I walked back some of it - i.e. pre-transition team only looked at =
things Obama might want to repeal, but their mission was only to come up =
with ideas, not to make decisions, and whoever her source is, they're =
way ahead of anyone else on this.   But, she's pretty much sticking to =
it - namely that some of these regulations, like stem cells or gag rule, =
are no-brainers for repeal and are on the list.  Not sure we won't those =
to be our first actions as president?

=20

I think it makes sense for one of you to get on the phone to do some =
background with her and pushback the finality of all of this.    Also, =
if outside groups haven't been consulted on "the list" - i.e. labor - we =
probably need something on the record that there's no final decisions, =
only ideas.=20

=20

Let me know.  Thanks.=20

=20

Here's her email:=20

=20

    It will say Obama intends to quickly reverse Bush policies on =
environment, drug safety, immigration and reproductive rights. We'll =
mention specifically, the Mexico city gag rule, conduct of immigration =
raids and the California "waiver" to regulate dioxide emissions. It will =
mention release of the CAP book on Wednesday with some description. Two =
sources have told me that transition teams have been quietly assembling =
this stuff for months -- without speaking to advocacy groups or anyone =
on the Hill. They have simply dug through public record. In other words, =
even though the groups are just now drawing up their wish lists, team =
Obama is actually far ahead.=20
