Thanks for taking the time to get back to me before your trip John!  I =
think the CPP is a very good (and smart) rule, which will make a huge =
difference. Some of the folks we turn to for expertise deeper than ours =
feel that it underestimates what can be achieved in the areas of energy =
efficiency and renewables.I=92ll be interested in your view on that. Re =
=93watering down the rule,=94  I confess to being a bit worried, that if =
the Prez weren=92t fully prepared to veto =93must-pass=94 legislation to =
which restrictions on CPP implementation are attached, a desire to be =
able to beat back such restrictions in the Senate might constrain what =
was in the final rule.  I know that you care every bit as much about =
this issue as I do (and that your deep commitment on it stretches back =
much longer than mine), and I believe the Prez cares very deeply about =
it too.  I want to make sure I=92m doing all I can to help make it =
everything you (and he) would like it to be.=20
May the trip go well!
