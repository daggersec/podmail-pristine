_Click  here: Labor Ad Calls On Obama To Aid Health Care Workers With Whom 
He  Campaigned_ 
(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/25/labor-ad-calls-on-obama-t_n_207378.html)  
 
Dear John, 
    this article is useful in laying out part of our  basic dilemma in 
California.  The article misses, perhaps because it was  written before the more 
recent proposals for even greater cuts to the program  that could lead to 
its decimation, is that Schwarzenegger is proposing to cut  90% of people off 
the in-home care program by raising the functional index,  excluding the 
vast majority of seniors and people with disabilities on the  program which 
will drive them into costlier institutions.

Since Governor  Schwarzenegger came into office and with Pete Wilson behind 
him, all the cuts to  California's budget began with cuts to the state's 
most vulnerable  citizens. When providing initial consultation to Governor 
Schwarzenegger,  Warren Buffett told him that our property taxes were too low.  
After that  Governor Schwarzenegger distanced him for the rest of his 
administration.  Instead, when cuts have had to be made, seniors living on $856 a 
month lost  their cost-of-living allowances. Now, the Governor with Pete 
Wilson  behind him who have been constantly gunning for the In-Home Supportive 
Services  Program, are on the verge of extinguishing this is a gem of 
public policy  that should serve as the model for the nation.  
 
In-home care delivers nursing services or fraction of the cost while  
permitting a young person with a disability to go to school at work and  
contribute to the community, and seniors the dignity and quality of life in  their 
own homes..  It costs approximately $11,000 a year to keep a senior  or a 
person with a disability at home with homecare.  When people are  put in 
nursing homes that average goes to $56,000 a year because as a one price  fits all 
to price tag for the nursing home.  A senior who merely needs  someone to 
shop and cook for them or help them to bed at night or bathe who  might live 
on homecare of around $12,000 a year will go to a nursing home which  will 
cost the taxpayers 56,000 a year.  This is a lose/ lose for all  involved. 
Just as homecare is a win-win for seniors and people with disabilities  who 
want to live active lives in their own homes is also a win for taxpayers.  
This benefit does not even include the benefit that comes from seniors and  
people with disabilities being kept in nursing homes which have a terrible 
track  record for abuse and neglect which I have sent you in other articles 
citing  government oversight results.  
This program that costs so much less economically and delivers incalculably 
more  in human terms is wastefully and stupidly on the chopping block in 
California  and we need President 0bama to prevent this terrible travesty from 
occurring. We  have a program that should be a model for the nation. If the 
president has  backpedaled on his commitment to the choice of in-home care 
rather than an  institutional bias on the federal level and is instead 
urging states to take up  this worthy cause,  this is all the more reason that he 
should not permit  the state of California to ruin this cost efficient 
program that is of  incalculable value to seniors and people with disabilities. 
There is  leverage that the federal government could exert on the state of 
California in  the form of Maintenance of Effort in order to receive stimulus 
money or surely  there are some of the ways.  However the President might 
keep our brilliant  program alive, he really should because what began as an 
overflow program in  California to cut costs to the state for nursing homes 
has turned into a  magnificent public policy that should be expanded not 
extinguished.
 
    Dear John, as always, you are the champion people  with disabilities 
look to and we're hoping the with your ingenuity and brilliant  way of dealing 
to create humane programs in Washington, you will point the way  to some 
solution to preserving this program that creates tremendous mercy for  seniors 
and people with disabilities while creating so many jobs for so many  
people who need them.
 
    With gratitude and admiration,
    your friend, Nancy
