Friend, I made a promise to you during my
campaign and I intend to keep it.=20

That's why, earlier this morning, I announced my intent to=20
line-item veto several items in the budget that prevented=20
Virginia from closing the coverage gap and instructed my=20
administration to do everything in our power to provide=20
health care to all Virginians.

In the face of demagoguery, fear, and hypocrisy from
Republicans in the Virginia General Assembly, I remain
committed to the central promise of my campaign: one of the
wealthiest states in one of the wealthiest nations in the
world has no excuse for not providing health care to its
needy citizens.

Please donate $5 today and declare that you think health care=20
in Virginia is a moral imperative.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/veto?refcode=3Demail_20140620

Unfortunately, these vetoes are not the final chapter in
this story -- and I'm counting on you to support me, just as
you did last year.

By refusing any and all compromise on the expansion of
Medicaid, the Republican leadership has elected to forfeit
$5 million per day in funding that we have already sent to=20
Washington. We have already lost $850 million as of
this morning.

That's why I will veto the Stanley Amendment and the Medicaid
Innovation and Reform Commission. And it's why I've
instructed Secretary of Health and Human Services Bill Hazel
to work with our federal partners in Washington, the
insurance industry, health care providers, our university
medical centers, non-profit organizations, and the hospital
industry itself to extend the promise of health care to our
people.

If you still believe that providing health care to hard
working Virginians is a moral imperative, I'm counting on
your support today.

Make a $5 donation to help me in this fight.

https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/veto?refcode=3Demail_20140620

During my campaign, you supported me and my deeply held
conviction that closing the coverage gap was the right thing
to do for Virginia's families and for our economy.

I'm counting on you to continue fighting alongside me.

Thank you,=20
Terry McAuliffe
