As you're thinking through the post-election structure for economic =
policy making/crisis management, how it relates to the appointment of =
the economic team, etc., please let me know if I can be of help.  =
Following my conversations with Bob, Bill, Josh et al about this this =
week, I've been trying to sort out in my own mind how it all might fit =
together to deal with the immediate challenges.=20
