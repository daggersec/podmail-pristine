So Robby and Marc stacked a few things tomorrow ahead of the Perkins Coie
Super PAC meetings:
9:30 - 10:30 am: Longer earned Media Call
10:30 am - 11 / 11:15 am: Press Call
11 am (likely starting late because of press) - 12:30 pm: Perkins Coie
Super PAC Meeting # 1 (CTR, no background reading)

... which is a problem because then you either have to
1) take the press call while walking to Perkins Coie
2) go to Perkins Coie early and take the 9:30 am call from there.  I could
arrange a space with Marc's assistant.

What do you want to do?

Also, Cheryl wants to call you, but tomorrow she's in a board meeting from
7 am - 3 pm and then off to Ghana at 4 pm (not sure how that works!).  She
might be awake when you get out of NRDC but likely not.
