Verdict expected in trial of bin Laden's driver
http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080805/wl_mideast_afp/usattacksjusticetrialgu=
antanamo_080805132911&printer=3D1;_ylt=3DAin8i_FvvgpVAnkNDfmszk.bOrgF
A verdict was expected Tuesday in the war crimes trial of Osama bin Laden's=
 former driver, in the first test of the controversial military tribunals c=
reated by President George W. Bush.
Six military jurors, who were handpicked by the Pentagon, began considering=
 the case Monday after a two-week trial.
Prosecutors alleged Salim Hamdan was involved in conspiracy and provided ma=
terial support to terrorism, while defense attorneys painted him as a lowly=
 cog in the wheel with no involvement in terror plots.
The Yemeni national, who is about 40 years old, allegedly met bin Laden in =
the Afghan city of Kandahar in 1996 and "ultimately became a bodyguard and =
personal driver" for the Al-Qaeda leader, the indictment said.
He faces a possible sentence of life in prison if at least four of the six-=
member jury find him guilty. Even if found innocent, he might not be freed,=
 since the US military reserves the right to indefinitely hold "enemy comba=
tants."
Hamdan's case was the first to undergo a full trial at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba=
 and will be an important test of the military commission system set up in =
the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
Prosecutors said Hamdan received training in the use of rifles, handguns an=
d machine guns in an Al-Qaeda camp and also "delivered weapons, ammunition =
or other supplies to Al-Qaeda members and associates."
"A plethora of facts that shows you how he committed overt acts in furthera=
nce of the conspiracy," said John Murphy, a Justice Department prosecutor, =
in closing arguments.
"Hamdan was Al-Qaeda, every fact in this case points to that," said Murphy,=
 describing Hamdan as an "Al-Qaeda warrior."
Lawyers for Hamdan, who has already spent six years behind bars at Guantana=
mo, argued that Hamdan was an insignificant figure while employed by bin La=
den from 1998 to 2001.
"This is a classic case of guilt by association," Lieutenant Commander Bria=
n Mizer, an assigned military defense lawyer for Hamdan, told the court.
"Mr. Hamdan is not an Al-Qaeda warrior, he is not Al-Qaeda's last line of d=
efense," Mizer said. "He's not even an Al-Qaeda member."
"You should not punish the general's driver today with the crimes of the ge=
neral."
Joseph McMillan, a civilian defense lawyer for Hamdan, pressed the same poi=
nt in closing arguments.
"The general is a war criminal, and therefore the driver also is? It didn't=
 work that way in World War II -- Hitler's driver was never charged with a =
war crime -- and it doesn't work that way today," McMillan said.
The Bush administration hopes the first war crimes trial since World War II=
 will show critics at home and abroad that the Guantanamo tribunals, which =
operate under different rules than regular civilian or military courts, off=
er the accused a fair process.
The military commissions were invalidated in 2006 by the Supreme Court, onl=
y to be restored a few months later by the US Congress.
They have since been struck by a series of legal battles and hitches -- inc=
luding a June Supreme Court decision that granted foreign terror suspects c=
aptured abroad the right to challenge their detention in US courts -- that =
had pushed back the opening of Hamdan's lawsuit, and perhaps others to come=
.
Of the 260 detainees currently in Guantanamo, only around 20 have been char=
ged with a crime and the government plans to put only 60 to 80 of them on t=
rial.
Several other Guantanamo inmates are also facing trial in Guantanamo includ=
ing Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Kuwaiti of Pakistani origin who is considered=
 the mastermind of the September 11 attacks on the United States.
