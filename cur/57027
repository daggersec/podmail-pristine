UNIONS

Secretary Clinton, yesterday in St. Louis, you spoke at carpenters and othe=
rs =93who built this nation.=94 Both you and Senator Sanders depend on big =
union support. President Obama pushed for a massive infrastructure bill tha=
t would mean millions of jobs for in this area. Yet many of these trade uni=
ons have locked out Blacks and other minorities for years. Will you call a =
meeting with them before November, and if you win, when you are president, =
to demand that the trade unions stop freezing Blacks and others from these =
good paying jobs?

INCOME INEQUALITY

Senators Sanders, you and Hillary Clinton have often talked about the probl=
em of income inequality. Many other Democrats have. Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. =
has talked about the lack of economic upward mobility for Black and other m=
inorities in Silicon Valley and corporate America. Yet Power Pac Plus did a=
 study showing that four years ago, the Democratic Party spent $514 million=
 on consultants, and only 1.7%, or $8.4 million went to minority-owned firm=
s or firms with at least one minority principle. How can the public be assu=
red that either one of you or the Democratic Party can fix income inequalit=
y when the same party practices it?

Here's one that worries me about HRC.

DEATH PENALTY

19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 st=
ates, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the Nation=
al Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been=
 on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been execut=
ed in the U.S. That=92s 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but lat=
er exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the curre=
nt list and abolish the death penalty?
