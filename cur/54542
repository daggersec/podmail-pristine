*No, Donald Trump. We=E2=80=99re not barring Muslims from entering the coun=
try.*
Dec 8, 2015 by Hillary Clinton

*And a message to Muslims.*

Donald Trump has made a name for himself in this election by trafficking in
prejudice and paranoia. Now he says he wants to stop all Muslims from
entering the United States. It=E2=80=99s a shameful idea. It=E2=80=99s also=
 dangerous. At a
time when America should be doing everything we can to fight radical
jihadists, Mr. Trump is supplying them with new propaganda. He=E2=80=99s pl=
aying
right into their hands.

Now some Republican candidates are saying that Donald Trump=E2=80=99s lates=
t
comments have gone too far. But the truth is, many GOP candidates have also
said extreme things about Muslims. Their language may be more veiled than
Mr. Trump=E2=80=99s, but their ideas aren=E2=80=99t so different.

Ben Carson says that a Muslim shouldn=E2=80=99t be president. Marco Rubio c=
ompares
Muslims to members of the Nazi Party and refuses to rule out monitoring and
closing of mosques. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz have suggested that we implement
a religious test for Syrian refugees=E2=80=94one that only Christians would=
 pass.
Chris Christie says not even 3-year-old Syrian orphans should be let in.
And they insist on using the phrase =E2=80=9Cradical Islamic terrorism=E2=
=80=9D=E2=80=94in fact,
they criticize anyone who says anything else=E2=80=94even though it drives =
the
exact narrative the jihadists want to advance: that we=E2=80=99re at war wi=
th an
entire religion.

When you take a step back and see what the Republican field as a whole says
about Muslims=E2=80=94not just one or two candidates for President, but nea=
rly all
of them=E2=80=94it=E2=80=99s hard to take seriously their attempts to dista=
nce themselves
from Mr. Trump. He=E2=80=99s just articulating the logical conclusion of wh=
at the
rest of them have been saying. As Mr. Trump said in an interview this
morning, =E2=80=9CThey condemn practically everything I say, and then they =
always
come to my side.=E2=80=9D

That should concern all of us. This kind of rhetoric sets us back in the
fight against radical jihadists=E2=80=94a fight we absolutely have to win, =
against
a brutal, nihilistic enemy who twists Islam to justify mass murder. These
jihadists cannot be contained; they have to be defeated. And the vast
majority of Muslims here and abroad are on our side in this fight. Many are
helping prevent radicalization, including here at home. So why would anyone
suggest that they=E2=80=99re the enemy? How does that help us? Radical jiha=
dists
are telling people that the United States hates Muslims=E2=80=94and there=
=E2=80=99s Donald
Trump on TV screaming about how he=E2=80=99s going to keep all Muslims out.=
 He=E2=80=99s
strengthening the terrorists=E2=80=99 argument.

He=E2=80=99s also taking aim at our values. Our country was founded by peop=
le
fleeing religious persecution. The notion that here, people are free to
practice their faith, whatever it is, is one of America=E2=80=99s most cher=
ished
principles. Maybe Mr. Trump should re-read President Washington=E2=80=99s 1=
790
letter to the Jewish community of Newport, Rhode Island, reassuring them
that, in the brand-new nation of the United States, their religious liberty
would always be protected. He wrote, =E2=80=9CThe Government of the United =
States
gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.=E2=80=9D In oth=
er
words, you can be you, and still be with us.

That=E2=80=99s something I=E2=80=99ll bet a lot of Muslim Americans need to=
 hear right now.
Imagine hearing political leaders threaten to register and track you,
implying that your religion is violent, that you=E2=80=99re violent, that y=
ou=E2=80=99re
the enemy. Nearly 3 million Americans are Muslims. They=E2=80=99re our fami=
ly, our
friends, our neighbors, and co-workers. They serve in the military, save
lives as doctors and nurses, and serve our communities as police officers,
firefighters, teachers, and civic leaders. They=E2=80=99re patriots=E2=80=
=94proud
Americans, just like the rest of us. They deserve better than this.

So today, I want to send a different message.

To Muslim Americans: What you=E2=80=99re hearing from Trump and other Repub=
licans
is absolutely, unequivocally wrong. It=E2=80=99s inconsistent with our valu=
es as a
nation=E2=80=94a nation which you are helping to build. This is your countr=
y, too.
I=E2=80=99m proud to be your fellow American. And many, many other American=
s feel
the same way.

Now is the time for all of us=E2=80=94especially Republican leaders=E2=80=
=94to stand up to
hateful, dangerous words and deeds.

Just a few days ago, two young women wearing headscarves were trying to
have breakfast at a caf=C3=A9 near the University of Texas at Austin when
another diner started shouting racist things at them. The girls left in
tears=E2=80=94in part because of the ugly words, but also because no one el=
se in
that crowded caf=C3=A9 came to their defense.

As they left, one of the girls asked the room, =E2=80=9CWho cares about us?=
=E2=80=9D
Somebody called out, =E2=80=9CNobody.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWe left,=E2=80=9D t=
hey said, =E2=80=9Cbecause it was true.=E2=80=9D

But it=E2=80=99s not true. And we have to make sure Muslim Americans know t=
hat.
It=E2=80=99s how we stay true to our values as Americans. And it=E2=80=99s =
how we show the
world who we really are=E2=80=94a strong, proud, united country that still =
knows,
after all these years, that all men and women are created equal.
