The DC Street Law Clinic and the DC Commission on Human Rights are happy to=
 invite you to visit the 4rd Annual High School Student Human Rights Multim=
edia Exhibit. The event will be held in the Hart Auditorium and foyers, Wed=
nesday, 11/19, from 3:30-5:30 PM. A short awards ceremony will be held arou=
nd 5 PM. This year, over 250 students in teams or individually from 15 high=
 schools have submitted 142 projects in various multimedia formats, includi=
ng poems, stories, songs, videos, power points, posters, drawings, artworks=
 and other innovative and expressive ways of illustrating what human rights=
 mean to them.

Here is what a former Street Law clinic student had to say about some of th=
em:
    I just wanted to say job well done to you and the entire Street Law Cli=
nic for the Human Rights Projects this year.  I've scored projects every ye=
ar since the program started, and they always seem to get even better year =
after year.  I wasn't able to travel to DC ... to score all of the projects=
 this year, but I scored [some] of the electronic submissions remotely.  I =
was blown away.  The projects were nothing short of remarkable.  Many of th=
em brought tears to my eyes.

Please take a moment to see a positive and creative dimension of teaching a=
nd learning the law in DC.

I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary work of our clinic law student=
s, the Street Law clinical fellows, Efrain Marimon and Jessica Gallagher, o=
ur research assistant team, the DC Commission on Human Rights, Chief Judge =
David Simmons and the Office of Human Rights, the Washington Lawyers Commit=
tee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, our many volunteers and our team of=
 evaluators led by Charisma Howell, a former Street Law fellow and Visiting=
 Professor.
Thank you.
