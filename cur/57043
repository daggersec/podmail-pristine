THE WHITE HOUSE
Office of the Press Secretary

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

August 24, 2015



FACT SHEET: President Obama Announces New Actions to Bring Renewable Energy=
 and Energy Efficiency to Households across the Country



Advancing Clean Energy Technology Innovation, Cutting Energy Bills, and Cre=
ating Jobs



President Obama is committed to taking responsible steps to address climate=
 change, promote clean energy and energy efficiency, drive innovation, and =
ensure a cleaner, more stable environment for future generations. That is w=
hy at Senator Reid=92s National Clean Energy Summit later today, he is anno=
uncing a robust set of executive actions and private sector commitments to =
accelerate America=92s transition to cleaner sources of energy and ways to =
cut energy waste.



These actions build on state leadership, all across America, to continue to=
 expand opportunities to install energy saving technologies in households t=
oday, particularly those that need it most, while driving the development o=
f innovative, low-cost clean energy technologies for tomorrow.



Last year, the United States brought online as much solar energy every thre=
e weeks as it did in all of 2008, and the solar industry added jobs 10 time=
s faster than the rest of the economy.  Since the beginning of 2010, the av=
erage cost of a solar electric system has dropped by 50 percent. In fact, d=
istributed solar prices fell 10 to 20 percent in 2014 alone and currently 4=
4 states have pricing structures that encourage increased penetration of di=
stributed energy resources.



Americans are also more empowered to capture opportunities to improve effic=
iency and cut energy waste. In fact, up to one third of households can trac=
k their energy use and learn ways to make choices on how to save on their e=
nergy bills. Since President Obama took office, the U.S. Department of Ener=
gy has already put in place appliance efficiency standards that will save A=
merican consumers nearly $480 billion on their utility bills through 2030, =
and the Environmental Protection Agency=92s ENERGY STAR Program continues t=
o help save consumers more than $34 billion per year going forward.



The executive actions and private sector commitments President Obama is ann=
ouncing today will continue to promote the use and development of smart, si=
mple, low-cost technologies to help households save on their energy bills a=
nd help America transition to cleaner, and more distributed energy resource=
s. These include:



>  Making $1 billion in additional loan guarantee authority available and a=
nnouncing new guidelines for distributed energy projects utilizing innovati=
ve technology and states looking to access this financing;

>  Unlocking residential Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing fo=
r single-family housing to make is easier for Americans to invest in clean =
energy technologies;

>  Launching a new HUD and DOE program to provide home owners with a simple=
 way to measure and improve the energy efficiency of their homes, by increa=
sing homeowners borrowing power;

>  Creating a DOD Privatized Housing Solar Challenge, and announcing compan=
ies are committing to provide solar power to housing on over 40 military ba=
ses across the United States, while saving military families money on energ=
y bills and making military communities more energy secure;

>  Announcing $24 million for 11 projects in seven states to develop innova=
tive solar technologies that double the amount of energy each solar panel c=
an produce from the sun;

>  Approving a transmission line that will support bringing online a 485-me=
gawatt photovoltaic facility that will be constructed in Riverside County a=
nd produce enough renewable energy to power more than 145,000 homes; and

>  Creating an Interagency Task Force to Promote a Clean Energy Future for =
All Americans; and announcing independent commitments from local government=
s, utilities, and businesses that are stepping up to drive energy efficienc=
y in more than 300,000 low-income households and investing more than $220 m=
illion in energy saving activities for veterans and low-income customers to=
 help decrease their energy bills.



Today=92s actions build on a longstanding commitment to create a clean ener=
gy economy<http://go.wh.gov/X2bHz4> for all Americans, will help states mee=
t the targets in the Clean Power Plan announced earlier this month, and set=
 us on a path to reach the President=92s goals, including:

>  Achieving an economy-wide target to reduce emissions by 26%-28% below 20=
05 levels in 2025;

>  Increase the share of renewables =96 beyond hydropower =96 in their resp=
ective electricity generation mixes to the level of 20% by 2030;

>  Installing 300 megawatts of renewable energy across federally subsidized=
 housing by 2020; and

>  Doubling energy productivity by 2030.



EXECUTIVE ACTIONS TO DRIVE CLEAN ENERGY AND CUT ENERGY WASTE



To continue to reinforce American leadership in deploying clean energy and =
cutting energy waste while creating jobs and reducing carbon pollution, the=
 Administration is announcing the following actions:



Making $1 Billion in Additional Loan Guarantee Authority Available and Anno=
uncing New Guidelines for Distributed Energy Projects Utilizing Innovative =
Technology:  Distributed Energy Projects are currently driving innovation a=
nd transforming U.S. energy markets. Technologies such as rooftop solar, en=
ergy storage, smart grid technology, and methane capture for oil and gas we=
lls, solve key energy challenges.  Catalyzing these technologies and demons=
trating the viability of these markets would create economic opportunity, s=
trengthen energy security, transform certain energy markets, and reduce gre=
enhouse gas emissions.  To accelerate the pace of innovation in distributed=
 energy, the Department of Energy is:



>  Inviting Innovative Distributed Energy Projects to Apply to More Than $1=
0 Billion in Current Loan Guarantees: The Department of Energy is supplemen=
ting its current loan guarantee solicitations to invite applications for Di=
stributed Energy Projects. The current Solicitations, totaling more than $1=
0 billion in loan guarantee authority, are now clearly unlocked to support =
scale up of Distributed Energy Projects utilizing innovative technology. To=
day=92s announcement includes guidance from the Department on how a Distrib=
uted Energy Project transaction could be properly structured.



>  Making Available $1 Billion in Additional Loan Guarantee Authority for N=
ew, Innovative Projects:  As part of its new push for Distributed Energy Pr=
ojects utilizing innovative technology, the Department of Energy is providi=
ng up to $1 billion in additional loan guarantee authority through its curr=
ent Solicitations for new Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Projects a=
nd Fossil Energy Projects.  This significantly boosts the resources availab=
le to new applicants.



>  Providing Clarity for States and State Green Banks on How to Work with t=
he Department=92s Loan Programs Office:  The Department of Energy is also i=
ssuing new guidance making clear that state-affiliated financial entities, =
including state green banks, may submit applications for Eligible Projects.=
  That means any state or state-affiliated entity that satisfies all other =
requirements for qualification as a borrower can submit applications for El=
igible Projects, including Distributed Energy Projects.  In addition, the D=
epartment made clear today that state and state-affiliated entities, includ=
ing state green banks, may participate in Distributed Energy Projects as le=
nders or co-lenders, off-takers or equity providers.



Announcing New Programs to Accelerate the Deployment of Clean Energy Techno=
logies Available Today: For more than 80 years, the Federal Housing Adminis=
tration (FHA) has provided low-income households and underserved communitie=
s access to safe and affordable mortgage credit. And with today=92s announc=
ement, FHA will provide additional opportunities for borrowers with FHA ins=
ured loans to benefit from affordable financing of home energy improvements=
, saving them money, and improving the environment. Today more than 7.6 mil=
lion households in the U.S. live in FHA-insured single family housing. To a=
ccelerate this transition and drive the deployment of renewable energy and =
energy efficiency in single family housing, the Department of Housing and U=
rban Development is taking the following actions:



>  Unlocking Residential Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing:PA=
CE is an innovative mechanism for financing energy efficiency and renewable=
 energy improvements. PACE financing allows homeowners to benefit from ener=
gy improvements immediately and pay back the cost over time through their p=
roperty taxes. When the property is sold, the remaining PACE loan stays wit=
h the more energy efficient property and the next owner is responsible for =
repaying the loan. PACE programs have the potential to unlock alternative s=
ources of capital to accelerate renewable energy and efficiency retrofits f=
or households, and reduce energy costs for consumers.



To remove existing barriers and accelerate the use of PACE financing for si=
ngle family housing, HUD=92s Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is announ=
cing today that, under guidance to be issued soon, properties with subordin=
ated PACE loans can be purchased and refinanced with an FHA insured mortgag=
e. HUD is issuing a preliminary statement<http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/d=
ocuments/huddoc?id=3DFTDO.pdf> indicating the conditions under which borrow=
ers purchasing or refinancing properties with existing PACE assessments wil=
l be eligible to use FHA-insured financing. Secretary Castro is also sendin=
g a letter to Governors<http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=
=3DGovernorsLetter.pdf> describing the options the FHA offers to make it ea=
sier for consumers to undertake energy efficiency and renewable energy impr=
ovements in their homes. FHA=92s evolving PACE guidance is also being infor=
med by ongoing conversations with the Federal Housing Finance Agency.



This action is distinct from the multifamily PACE guidance for the State of=
 California that HUD released earlier this year. The guidance clarified the=
 circumstances under which HUD will approve unsubordinated PACE financing o=
n HUD-assisted and -insured multifamily housing in California in order to f=
acilitate the establishment of a California Multifamily PACE Pilot.



>  Increasing Homeowners Borrowing Power to Make Energy Efficiency Improvem=
ents: HUD=92s FHA Energy Efficient Home Program and DOE are launching a pro=
gram to provide potential homeowners with an easy way to measure and improv=
e the energy efficiency of their homes. Under the new HUD and DOE Home Ener=
gy Score<http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/home-energy-score>partnership, in=
 areas where the Home Energy Score is available, single family households w=
ill be able to increase their access to financing tools to make energy effi=
ciency improvements. DOE=92s Home Energy Score offers a =93miles per gallon=
=94 type rating to estimate a home=92s energy use on a 10-point scale. A =
=931=94 corresponds to the least energy efficient homes and a =9310=94 corr=
esponds to the most energy efficient homes, while the average U.S. home wil=
l score a =935.=94 Through this new partnership, homebuyers or homeowners w=
ho want to obtain an FHA-insured purchase or refinance mortgage for a singl=
e family home that receives a Home Energy Score of 6 or higher will be elig=
ible to increase their income qualifying ratio by 2 percentage points above=
 the standard Single Family FHA limit, making it easier to secure financing=
 to make these improvements.



DOD Privatized Housing Solar Challenge:  Approximately 72 MWs of solar ener=
gy producing infrastructure has been installed on over 60,000 Department of=
 Defense (DOD) privatized housing units to date. To amplify this progress, =
earlier this summer, DOD and the White House Council on Environmental Quali=
ty convened the companies that own the privatized housing units to share be=
st practices and encourage them to set goals for increasing the amount of s=
olar energy generated on privatized military housing through the end of 201=
6.



Today, four companies are committing to provide solar power to housing on o=
ver 40 military bases across the United States, while saving military famil=
ies money on energy bills and making military communities more energy secur=
e. These commitments total over 233 MWs, reducing annual carbon emissions b=
y approximately 324 metric tons.



>  Balfour Beatty: Balfour Beatty Communities has joined forces with DOD to=
 install solar at the following 12 military installations across the US: La=
kehurst, NJ; New London CT; Long Island, NY; Newport, RI; Saratoga Springs,=
 NY; Ft Bliss, TX; Ft Detrick, MD; Wheaton, MD; Ft Hamilton, NY; Ft Leonard=
 Wood, MO; West Point, NY; and Ft Carson, CO.  This effort will generate ap=
proximately 63.35MW of solar power and continue to reduce carbon emissions =
across Balfour Beatty Communities=92 Military Family Housing portfolio.



>  Corvias: Corvias Solutions (Corvias) along with Onyx Renewable Partners,=
 is working with DOD to install solar on 12 military installations across t=
he United States. This effort is expected to generate approximately 100MW o=
f solar power that will provide increased energy security and reduce annual=
 carbon emissions by approximately 92,000 tons. Corvias will continue to in=
novate with its Army partner and has received initial approval to move forw=
ard on solar installations at Aberdeen Proving Grounds and Fort Meade, MD; =
Fort Bragg, NC; Fort Polk, LA; Fort Rucker, AL; Fort Sill, OK; and Fort Ril=
ey, KS.



>  Lincoln Military Housing: Lincoln Military Housing is leveraging the cur=
rent 20 MW system being installed on privatized military housing in San Die=
go to install a new proposed solar project that would add 60 MW of power ge=
nerating capabilities to its national portfolio of privatized military hous=
ing. Lincoln Military Housing provides more than 31,000 family homes for mi=
litary members across the United States.



>  United Communities: United Communities, which provides homes for 2,000 m=
ilitary families living at Joint Base McGuire Dix Lakehurst in New Jersey, =
will deploy an additional 10 MW of cost-effective, private sector solar gen=
erated electricity serving 1,147 of these homes in 2016. This new project w=
ill increase solar generation to at least 16 MW, representing 90% of total =
electricity consumed by the residents of these privatized military homes. T=
he significant electricity savings generated from the additional ground-mou=
nted solar array will directly benefit families living on the base.



Pushing the Bar on Low-Cost Solar Technology: The Advanced Research Project=
s Agency =96 Energy (ARPA-E)=92s Micro-scale Optimized Solar-cell Arrays wi=
th Integrated Concentration (MOSAIC) Program is announcing $24 million for =
11 projects in seven states across the country to develop innovative solar =
technologies to double the amount of energy each solar panel can produce fr=
om the sun, while reducing costs and the space required to generate solar e=
nergy.

Approving a New Transmission Line to Deploy Solar Energy: Today, U.S. Secre=
tary of the Interior Sally Jewell announced that the Bureau of Land Managem=
ent (BLM) has approved the Blythe Mesa Solar project in California and its =
transmission line that will support bringing online the 485-megawatt photov=
oltaic facility that will be constructed in Riverside County and produce en=
ough renewable energy to power more than 145,000 homes in California.

Creating an Interagency Task Force to Promote a Clean Energy Future for All=
 Americans: Building on the Administration=92s initiative to increase acces=
s to solar energy for all Americans, and recognizing the importance of ensu=
ring that the communities most likely to be impacted by climate change must=
 also share in the benefits a clean energy future, today, President Obama i=
s creating an Interagency Task Force to Promote a Clean Energy Future for A=
ll Americans, that will work in partnership with states and community organ=
izations to identify opportunities to improve energy efficiency and scale u=
p the deployment renewable energy in low- and moderate- income communities.=
 The Task Force, whose participants include the Executive Office of the Pre=
sident, DOE, EPA, HUD, USDA, DOL, and Treasury, will work to enhance this s=
hared goal through three key mechanisms:



>  Leveraging the Clean Energy Incentive Program:  The Task Force will supp=
ort low-income communities through the development and implementation of th=
e Clean Power Plan=92s Clean Energy Incentive Program. The CEIP is a volunt=
ary =93matching fund=94 program that states can use to incentivize early in=
vestment in eligible wind and solar projects, as well as demand-side energy=
 efficiency projects, including those that are implemented in low-income co=
mmunities.  In particular, the Task Force will help to identify Administrat=
ion-wide funding and technical assistance for states, cities, and organizat=
ions, easing access to the Federal tools and programs available to increase=
 energy efficiency and deploy renewable energy in low- and moderate- income=
 communities. This fall, EPA is also releasing a new resource that will hig=
hlight effective programs and policies at the state and local levels that h=
ave led to the successful adoption of energy efficiency and renewable energ=
y in low-income communities.



>  Enhancing Federal Resources for Low-and Moderate Income Communities: Bui=
lding on the programs already available <http://go.wh.gov/3rErsZ>  the Task=
 Force will review the Administration=92s programs and policies relating to=
 the availability of clean energy and renewable energy programs nationwide,=
 including within low- and moderate-income communities, with the goal of en=
hancing funding availablein both our existing programs and through the FY20=
17 budget process.



>  Identifying Private Sector Partners and Foundation Support: Today, the P=
resident is calling on mayors and county officials, the private sector, and=
 foundations to step up and support the deployment of clean and efficient t=
echnologies in low-and moderate-income communities. The Task Force will fac=
ilitate partnerships between communities and private sector organizations. =
Already, the following organizations are stepping up to drive energy effici=
ency in more than 300,000 low-income households and investing more than $22=
0 million in energy saving activities for veterans and low-income customers=
 to help decrease their energy bills:



=B7         The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) is=
 committing to advancing energy efficiency in low-income households in the =
next year through:

o   Providing technical assistance and developing resources for utilities a=
nd state agencies so that energy efficiency programs can better serve low- =
and moderate-income households, especially those residing in affordable mul=
tifamily buildings.

o   Working with HUD to increase energy efficiency investments in subsidize=
d housing stock. This includes encouraging utilities to provide whole-build=
ing energy data and targeted programs that serve this sector.

o   Providing technical assistance and resources to local governments so th=
at citywide energy efficiency efforts reach low- and moderate-income househ=
olds and small businesses in these communities. ACEEE will also work with l=
ocal governments to ensure that these energy efficiency efforts be consider=
ed as strategies within state and utility energy planning.

o   Producing a best practice guide on community-based lending for energy e=
fficiency in low- and moderate-income communities.



=B7         Bosch is committing to dedicating part of its sales force to fo=
cus specifically on outreach to school districts in low income communities,=
 as well as in extreme climate areas, where energy resiliency is paramount.=
 These activities could include:

o   Working to educate stakeholders and decision makers in low-income commu=
nities about the opportunities and benefits of high-efficiency buildings, p=
articularly schools.

o   Sharing critical information with stakeholders on how projects can be i=
mplemented in their regions, including case studies from existing Bosch sch=
ool improvement projects.

o   Providing best practices on how other schools integrate energy efficien=
cy projects into student curriculum and reinforce teaching and learning abo=
ut energy conservation in the classroom.



=B7         CLEAResult and E4thefuture are announcing a new initiative that=
 will establish a deeper Weatherization program that will focus on recruiti=
ng and training Native American professionals to become energy auditors. Th=
e initial scope of this project will have a goal of identifying as many as =
10 new energy professionals from the Native American tribal communities tha=
t CLEAResult serves in Michigan. This initiative will demonstrate that resi=
dential energy efficiency works to not only lower energy costs for low inco=
me consumers but also strengthen communities, create jobs and improve the h=
ousing conditions for low income consumers.



=B7         Connecticut Weatherization Assistance Program (CT WAP), their C=
ommunity Action-based subgrantees, utility partners, and strategic financia=
l partners have identified a range of energy efficiency opportunities that =
are the result of innovative efforts to expand the reach of the U.S. WAP an=
d other residential efficiency programs via community outreach to underserv=
ed areas. CT WAP and its subgrantees have prepared needs assessments relate=
d to Urban Revitalization programs combined with health and safety stakehol=
ders on the state and local levels and have established key relationships w=
ith renewable energy, heating system replacement, community lighting and cl=
ient education services. CT WAP estimates that 1,000 homes per year (2,800 =
persons) could benefit from additional efficiency efforts above and beyond =
what services are currently being delivered in the state, or more than 4,00=
0 units (11,200 persons) over a 48-month period. Given the existing capacit=
y and workload, contracting and expansion of services would require a ramp =
up period of 30 to 60 days and production and public benefit could be reali=
zed within 90 days of agreements.



=B7         Commons Energy in Ohio is making a new commitment to provide se=
rvice to low and moderate income populations in Efficiency Smart=92s servic=
e territory. This builds on their existing commitment to comprehensive tota=
l-energy solution for owners of small to mid-size multifamily affordable ho=
using, education, health care, and community and municipal facilities who m=
ay have difficulty accessing capital, technical skills, and implementation =
services.



=B7         The Compact of Mayors, a global coalition of mayors and city of=
ficials that have pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance re=
silience to climate change, is committing to further the uptake of clean en=
ergy technologies, including in low-income communities, and to track overal=
l progress. U.S. Cities are taking significant steps to reduce emissions, b=
ut the only way to measure progress is through a transparent and consistent=
 system that provides accountability.  19 U.S. Cities have already signed o=
nto the Compact, and 15 more are announcing their commitment today, includi=
ng:



o   Atlanta

o   Austin

o   Bridgeport

o   Camuy (PR)

o   Chicago

o   Chula Vista

o   Grand Rapids

o   King County

o   New York

o   Oakland

o   San Francisco

o   Santa Monica

o   Seattle

o   West Hollywood

o   West Palm Beach

o   The President is challenging all Mayors to publicly commit to a climate=
 action plan ahead of the Paris UN meeting, and has set a goal of having at=
 least 100 US cities that have signed onto the Compact by the end of Novemb=
er.



=B7         The Community Preservation Corporation (CPC), a nonprofit mortg=
age lender providing leading-edge capital solutions to the complex issues f=
acing communities throughout New York State, has committed to underwriting =
the projected energy reduction savings from conservation projects into its =
first mortgage financing procedure. CPC will work with their partners at bo=
th the state and municipal level including the Governor=92s office, HCR, NY=
SERDA, and the New York City Energy Efficiency Corporation to create and pr=
eserve over 750 units of high-performance housing for low- and moderate-inc=

it from weatherization and solar installations.



=B7         The Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority commits=
 to serving approximately 200-300 households via a Healthy Homes Program to=
 address deferral issues preventing homes from being weatherization-ready. =
The program will address roof leaks, mold, moisture, electrical systems and=
 other issues that frequently lead to deferral of weatherization jobs. The =
focus of this program is not only to make the home weatherization-ready, bu=
t to address issues that may affect the health of families served. Addition=
al hazards to be addressed might include eliminating trip hazards, installi=
ng hand rails, and addressing asthma triggers. Approximately 200 to 300 peo=
ple will benefit from this program, which is slated to start April 1, 2016.



=B7         Lime Energy is committing to provide energy efficient facility =
upgrades for over 1,000 small businesses in low-to-moderate income communit=
ies. Lime Energy has already completed more than 100,000 such projects crea=
ting thousands of jobs and driving over $1 billion dollars back into the lo=
cal economies of the communities that it serves.



=B7         The Maryland Public Service Commission is announcing that no la=
ter than the Spring of 2016 it will establish energy efficiency goals speci=
fic to limited-income programs administered as part of the statewide EmPOWE=
R Maryland initiative, which will require targeted investment in this this =
critical sector and may require a ramp-up of existing programs in 2016 and =
beyond. The new goals will build on a framework of accountability designed =
to increase the reach of the EmPOWER limited-income programs to as many eli=
gible participants as possible.  Since 2009, the EmPOWER Maryland program h=
as weatherized, at no additional cost to the homeowner, 16,795 limited-inco=
me households, resulting in an average savings per limited-income household=
 of 2,995 kWh per year.

iced. They are committed to effectively shining a spotlight on the work of =
their membership and acting as the single-point-of-contact for the Weatheri=
zation network on all matters related to energy efficiency initiatives. The=
 success of these efforts will be shared with all programs to encourage oth=
ers to find ways to implement innovative practices in Weatherization to ass=
ist low-income families being served by the Weatherization Assistance Progr=
am (WAP), including the commitments from the Connecticut Weatherization Ass=
istance Program, Dominion Virginia Power, The Indiana Housing and Community=
 Development Authority, and Southwestern Regional Housing and Community Dev=
elopment Corporation.



=B7         New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSER=
DA) is announcing it has submitted a proposal to the New York Public Servic=
e Commission (PSC) to establish a new $5 billion ten year Clean Energy Fund=
 (CEF), of which $78 million each year is proposed to be directed to increa=
sing energy affordability and access to clean energy options for low and mo=
derate income (LMI) communities and households. The New York Governor's off=
ice has created an inter-agency working group to identify and pursue strate=
gies to help implement and maximize the impact of NYSERDA's LMI commitment =
under the CEF.



=B7         New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has establishe=
d a new, optional Passive House track for applicants seeking competitive po=
ints for Green Building under its August 2015 Request for Proposals for Uni=
fied Funding Programs (RFP) to encourage a significant increase in the ener=
gy efficiency of New York=92s affordable housing stock.  This RFP makes fun=
ding available through eleven state housing programs.  To obtain the compet=
itive points under this track, projects may qualify under either the Passiv=
e House Institute US (PHIUS), or the International Passive House Institute =
(iPHI) programs.  HCR intends to work closely with NYSERDA to monitor the o=
ngoing energy use intensity of any Passive House projects that may be selec=
ted for funding under the RFP, in order to provide valuable data to the mar=
ket to accelerate the trend toward construction of Passive House certified =
affordable multifamily buildings.



=B7         Opower is committing to serve 300,000 additional low-income hou=
seholds and driving $3 million more in energy savings over the next year, h=
elping low-income families save a total of 30,000 MWh and $3 million on the=
ir utility bills.



=B7         Southwestern Regional Housing and Community Development Corpora=
tionwill provide a pathway to alternative energy for up to eleven new-build=
 homes. Each home will have a 1kw residential wind turbine installed as par=
t of a package of energy efficiency measures. The wind power will reduce th=
e energy burden for families served, especially when combined with energy e=
fficient methods of home building. The success of this pilot program could =
be used to launch similar, larger-scale projects in New Mexico. The New Mex=
ico Mortgage Finance Authority is also launching a low-interest loan progra=
m to install high-efficiency furnaces for low-income families at a discount=
ed cost in an effort to connect vulnerable households with reliable and eff=
icient heating systems. The initiative will serve approximately 50 househol=
ds per year and will start November 10.



=B7         Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, co-founders of Nest Labs, have com=
mitted to donate 500 Nest Learning Thermostats for a pilot program with the=
 Community and Economic Development Association (CEDA) of Cook County in Ch=
icago.  Studies have shown that Nest thermostats can save people an average=
 of 10-15% on their heating and cooling bills, and the Nest-CEDA program wi=
ll specifically examine their use to benefit low-income weatherization proj=
ects.
