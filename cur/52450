I know that not everyone reads blogs, so I thought I would send out to =
my friends who I knew to be interested in electoral politics a couple of =
recent pieces I have written with my own summary on key races in the =
2010 election cycle. There are an extraordinary number of competitive =
races this year, and I hope these notes are helpful in thinking about =
races.
=20
I will be doing articles like this on different races and aspects of =
these elections from time to time between now and election day, and will =
forward the articles I think you will find most informative, but if you =
don't want to receive these updates, please don't hesitate to just let =
me know. If you think I have missed anything important, or gotten =
something wrong, I am also always glad to hear your thoughts any time.

memorandum
to:                 interested parties
from:          mike lux
subject:    memo on 2010 house and senate races
date:           8/23/10
cc:                =20
            I am going to start writing election updates on a very =
regular basis between now and Election Day, but from a different =
perspective than I usually do. Since I left the White House in 1995, =
each election cycle I have been working from the outside of the party, =
focusing my political work on 501(c)3, 501 (c)4, 527, and independent =
expenditure projects. As many of you know, for several cycles now Carla =
Ohringer Engle and I have organized conference calls and sent out update =
memoranda on this outside track. This cycle, because of a project I =
agree to work on with MoveOn.org regarding their cleaning up corporate =
corruption in Washington campaign, I am back to working directly with =
candidates, campaigns, and party committees.
=20
As a result of this shift, one of the projects I will be taking on is to =
report to you the critical information I think is helpful in making =
decisions about which candidates and campaigns to directly help. Here is =
an update on the most competitive Senate and House races.
=20
Senate
=20
            I want all the Democrats to beat all the Republicans, but =
with 19 different races that are competitive to one degree or another, I =
will be focusing my personal attention to the races that I care the most =
about, namely the ones with strong progressive candidates running in the =
tightest races. However, I know everyone cares about a wide variety of =
different factors, issues, and races, so I will give updates on every =
Senate race each time I write. I am putting them into three different =
categories. The first is made up of the more conservative Democrats from =
more conservative states. The second is the biggest group, decent =
progressive candidates in tough races. The third category is the one I =
am personally most strongly prioritizing: strong progressives in tough =
but winnable races.
=20
Category 1 (no particular order)
=20
1.	Arkansas. Blanche Lincoln vs. John Boozman. Lincoln virtually =
destroyed herself with her paralysis and contradictions during the =
health care fight, making almost everyone incredibly angry. She is 20 =
points down in the polls, badly wounded by the tough primary fight, and =
very few Democrats around the country are eager to help her. However, =
she proved in the primary that she is one hell of a campaigner, and she =
does have a 4-1 cash advantage over a rather flawed Republican =
candidate, so she's not dead yet.
=20
2.	Louisiana. Charlie Melancon vs. David Vitter. Melancon voted against =
health care reform, is a conservative on most social issues, and, like =
all Louisiana politicians, won't buck the oil industry. On the other =
hand, he's taken a gutsy stand on some populist economic issues, =
including the Employee Free Choice Act, and is running against one of =
the top sleazebags in the Senate, David Vitter. This is an interesting =
race: it is hard to imagine a Democrat winning in the Deep South in such =
a Republican year, but Melancon is a good candidate and Vitter has some =
flaws, to understate the case by a mile or more.
=20
3.	Indiana. Brad Ellsworth vs. Dan Coats. Ellsworth would be a =
conservative vote on most social issues, and will have to be lobbied =
heavily on everything else, but I do give him some credit for being an =
economic populist on some issues, including health care, the stimulus, =
and banking reform this year (although he totally screwed up by coming =
out against repealing Bush's tax cuts for the rich). Coats is the worst =
caricature of a DC lobbyist, and should be vulnerable as a result, but =
it is a tough year for any Democrat to win in Indiana.
=20
Category 2 (no particular order)
=20
1.	Paul Hodes vs. TBD. Kelly Ayotte would be a pretty strong candidate =
for the Republicans if she wins the primary. She has been consistently =
up by Hodes by double digits. If she loses to the rich right-winger =
running against her, though, Hodes has more potential to win. The best =
thing about Hodes is that he has begun running strongly on the reform =
agenda MoveOn and many other progressives have been promoting, which I =
think will help him.
=20
2.	Connecticut. Dick Blumenthal vs. Linda McMahon. Blumenthal's Vietnam =
stupidity wounded him, and McMahon will outspend him enormously. On the =
other hand, the WWF thing gives Democrats plenty of ammo, Blumenthal has =
been a well-liked Attorney General, and Connecticut is a Democratic =
state. I think Blumenthal's 8-10 point lead might shrink a little, but =
he is likely to win if he can do a decent job turning out the Democratic =
vote.
=20
3.	Florida. TBD vs. Marco Rubio vs. Charlie Crist. This is a confusing =
race all the way around. One of the worst people in this year's field of =
candidates, credit default swap kingpin Jeff Greene, is spending ungodly =
amounts of money to try and buy the Democratic nomination from Kendrick =
Meek, who is a very solid guy. If Greene wins the primary, no national =
Democrat will want to be associated with him, and he has no chance. If =
Meek wins, he will still have an uphill race in an odd three-way =
campaign. Crist is dangling the idea of caucusing with the Democrats, =
which may make it less compelling for national party money to go to =
Meeks.
=20
4.	Pennsylvania. Joe Sestak vs. Pat Toomey. Sestak is a solid candidate =
running a decent but not especially strong campaign. Toomey is the =
darling of both economic and social conservatives, the former head of =
the Club for Growth and a caucus of "family values" conservatives in the =
House. Sestak has a 2.5 million dollar money gap at the moment. Given =
the money edge, Sestak's flawed campaign, and Pennsylvania turning =
harder than many states against Obama, this will be a tough race to win.
=20
5.	Nevada. Harry Reid vs. Sharron Angle. Reid's approval ratings have =
been lagging for a year, but Angle may be the most extreme candidate of =
all in an extreme year for Republican candidates. Reid has moved a few =
points ahead in most of the polling reports available. I think Reid will =
pull this race out, just because of how crazy Angle is.
=20
6.	Washington. Patty Murray vs. Dino Rossi. Any other year, Murray would =
be breezing to re-election as she has been a fairly popular Senator and =
Rossi has a lot of flaws as a candidate, but right now they are running =
neck and neck. Outside Republican groups are targeting this race =
heavily. This will go down to the wire, with Democratic turnout being =
critically important.
=20
7.	Colorado. Michael Bennet vs. Ken Buck. I would have preferred =
Romanoff in this primary, who ran as a populist insurgent outsider, but =
Bennet is running a good campaign as well, and Buck is another very =
extreme Tea Party candidate. I think Bennet will pull out a tough race =
in the end, but this one will be close.
=20
8.	Delaware. Chris Coons vs. Mike Castle. This is an uphill race because =
Castle is popular, but Coons is running a very solid campaign, and =
Delaware is a pretty Democratic state. Coons is behind, but not by as =
much as people thought he would be.
=20
9.	Ohio. Lee Fisher vs. Rob Portman. Fisher survived a =
tougher-than-expected primary against a progressive woman with no money. =
Portman is an ex-Wall Street exec and Bush trade czar. This will be one =
of the closest races in the country. Unfortunately, Fisher has a $7.5 =
million fundraising deficit right now.
=20
10.	Missouri. Robin Carnahan vs. Roy Blunt. Roy Blunt was Tom DeLay's =
closest ally in the House. His entire career has been intertwined with =
helping the worst actors in corporate America. He has been the go-to guy =
for tobacco, the big banks, big oil, big insurance companies, and has is =
as right-wing as you can get on social issues as well. Robin has been a =
strong progressive reformer on both social and economic issues.
=20
This is another tough race in the lean Republican political environment =
of Missouri in a Republican year. Robin in some respects is the right =
kind of populist to take on a sleazy insider like Blunt, and she is =
keeping the race very close. Unfortunately she just did the incredibly =
dumb thing of backing the Republicans on Bush's tax cuts for the rich, =
undercutting her case as a populist fighting for the middle class. =
Before she did that, I had this race as my number two priority for =
progressives, but that was a terrible decision.
=20
Category 3. My top priority races, this time in reverse priority order. =
Given the candidates, campaigns, and their opponents, these are the =
races progressives could have the biggest impact on.
=20
6. California. Barbara Boxer vs. Carly Fiorina. I hesitated to put this =
on the list, because California is such a big state and there is so much =
money swirling around that it is hard to make a difference. This race, =
though, is really important in many different ways. Boxer is an =
outspoken old school progressive, and if someone like her can't get =
elected in California, it will send shock waves through the entire =
national party. I've always thought Barbara was important in internal =
Senate dynamics because she is one of a very few progressives willing to =
push back and speak up against a lot of the good old boys who still =
dominate the Senate Democratic caucus. And beating the worst kind of =
corporate CEO hack like Fiorina is important symbolically in a populist =
year.
=20
5. North Carolina. Elaine Marshall vs. Richard Burr. Elaine Marshall is =
a great candidate, remarkably progressive for the South, and Richard =
Burr has some big vulnerabilities- he's just not very popular. But =
Marshall has a $6 million fundraising deficit, and it will be very tough =
to win anywhere in the South in 2010.
=20
4. Iowa. Roxanne Conlin vs. Chuck Grassley. This is the single toughest =
race of my top tier but it packs a massive political punch. Grassley is =
the ultimate entrenched political insider, the ranking Republican on =
Senate Finance, and with the possible exception of Mitch McConnell, may =
be the Senator who has done more to help big multinational corporations =
than anyone else. He is running against the ultimate movement =
progressive running this year, Roxanne Conlin. She is a crusading =
attorney who has spent her legal career suing big business on behalf of =
poor and working-class consumers, was an early leader of the feminist =
movement, and has been a supporter of every progressive issue campaign =
over the last 40 years.
=20
No one gave Roxanne a chance when she decided to run, but Grassley's =
negatives have been steadily rising and she is within single digits. =
It's still a tough race to win in this Republican year, but Roxanne is =
in range.
=20
3. Kentucky. Jack Conway vs. Rand Paul. Kentucky will be very tough for =
any Democrat to win, but this is a hugely important race. Paul is the =
top priority for tea partiers around the country, and if he gets a seat =
in the Senate, their extremist movement will have will have a standard =
bearer for years to come. I have been very impressed by Conway and the =
kind of campaign he is running, and he is very much in this race in =
spite of the toughness of the Kentucky political terrain.
=20
2. Wisconsin. Russ Feingold vs. Ron Johnson. I get the sense that very =
few people understand how tough this race is shaping up for Feingold. =
Wisconsin is far more of a purple state than a blue one, and it has been =
hard-hit by the recession. Johnson is a very effective candidate, =
running ads with a compelling message, and he has tons of money. This =
race is currently a dead heat, and progressives will have to kick in big =
to save the seat.
=20
1. Alexi Giannoulias vs. Mark Kirk. In my view, the race for Obama's old =
Senate seat is the most important race in the country for progressives. =
Kirk has been proven to be a serial liar about his biography, and a =
staunch supporter of the big banks and corporate America, but with his =
moderate social issue views, if he becomes an incumbent he will be tough =
to beat in the future even in a Democratic state like Illinois.
=20
Alexi Giannoulias, on the other hand, is a crusading reformer who has =
staked his campaign on taking on big money and big business, and has =
pledged to form a Senate progressive caucus if he wins the race. He has =
lost a lot of money by turning down corporate lobbyist contributions, =
though, and Kirk has a $3 million edge, and the Chamber of Commerce is =
running attacks ads for him. Every dollar we can swing toward Alexi in =
this race right now is critical. The symbolism of winning this race and =
the stakes for the future only adds to its importance.
=20
House races
=20
As with the Senate, there are an extraordinary number of competitive =
House races this year. A lot of the Democrats elected the last couple of =
cycles are in danger, other Democrats usually safe are looking nervously =
over their shoulder at a really tough year, there are quite a few =
competitive open seats, and some Republican seats are up for grabs too =
in this wild year. Estimates on the number of seats in play range into =
the 70s or even 80s.
=20
Given that, I am not going to list every competitive seat- between the =
DCCC, Cook, Rothenberg, and many good election-oriented blogs, there are =
plenty of places you can get the full list and some background. Instead, =
I will only list the general election races I think matter the most to =
progressives:
=20
1.	VA-5. Tom Perriello vs. Robert Hurt. I put this at the top because I =
think it is symbolically the most important race of the year: can a =
Democrat who voted with progressives on virtually every major issue from =
this kind of southern conservative working-class district win in a year =
like this? The odds are long, and Tom is behind right now, but if anyone =
can do it, he can. Perriello is a great campaigner who has raised a ton =
of money, and his appeal to values-based economic populism is =
compelling. Because Tom has raised so much money, other candidates =
probably need your contributions more, although as tough as this race =
is, he can still use help. But if there is anything else you can do, =
including recruiting volunteers and signing up to make calls, please do =
so.
=20
2.	WI-7. Open seat formerly held by Obey. Julie Lassa is the Democratic =
candidate, who is a progressive populist in the Obey mold, except unlike =
Obey she is also pro-choice. This is a challenging working-class =
district, though, and she needs a lot of financial help quickly to =
compete. It would be a real shame to have progressive populist Dave =
Obey's seat go to a right-wing Republican.
=20
3.	NH-1. Carol Shea-Porter. Shea-Porter is the strong progressive who =
upset the party establishment favorite in the primary in 2006, then went =
on to upset the heavily favored Republican in the general election =
without a dime from the DCCC. Her district is the more conservative of =
the two New Hampshire districts, and she has a serious challenge this =
year. Since she rejects all money from lobbyists and corporate PACs, she =
will really need our help.
=20
4.	OH-15. Mary Jo Kilroy. This is one of the most competitive districts =
and races in the country. Kilroy has been a strong supporter of =
progressive reform legislation, and is opposed by a bank lobbyist and =
Boehner prot=E9g=E9. Given that Kilroy was a key player in making the =
financial reform bill more progressive, the bankers are gunning for her =
with big money.
=20
5.	IL-10. Dan Seals. This is Kirk's old seat. Seals almost took Kirk out =
in 2008, and is running a strong race to win the open seat. It's a =
suburban Chicago district, less populist than some, but I'm impressed =
with the campaign dan is running. However, it is the Chicago media =
market, and he needs to raise a lot of money.
=20
6.	FL-25. Joe Garcia. Joe is a friend of progressive groups in Florida, =
and has been a leader in working to bring the Cuban-American community =
out of the right-wing Republican politics of the past. Joe came so close =
to beating the incumbent Mario Diaz-Balart in 2008 that Diaz-Balart =
switched to a safer district.
=20
7.	NY-19. John Hall. Hall was a professional musician before running for =
Congress, and has been a strong populist reformer in spite of a very =
marginal district. He is facing a very strong, very wealthy self-funding =
opponent, and really needs to raise some money.
=20
8.	OH-16. John Boccieri. Boccieri came through for us on health care =
reform when many people with districts not as tough as his chickened =
out. He is also facing a self-funding right-wing candidate in a tough, =
working-class district alienated from Obama.
=20
9.	OH-13. Betty Sutton. Another candidate from a tough working-class =
district. Also facing a self-funding right winger (yes, there are some =
trends here). This is Sherrod Brown's old district, and Betty is a =
prot=E9g=E9 of his. Enough said, as far as I am concerned.
=20
10.	DE At-Large. John Carney. This is the Castle open seat. Delaware is =
a pretty Democratic state, and Carney seems like a quality guy. His =
Republican opponent will probably be another self-funder out of the =
banking industry.
=20
11.	PA-07. Bryan Lentz. This is Sestak's open seat. It is one of the =
most competitive swing districts in the country, and Lentz is as solid =
progressive candidate.
=20
12.	PA-06. Manan Trivedi. Republican incumbent Jim Gerlach has survived =
a series of close challenges, but the district leans Dem and Manan is a =
strong progressive running a good campaign. Gerlach is another candidate =
we need to finally beat.
=20
13.	CA-45. Steve Pougnet. This is a district carried by Obama in 2008, =
and Steve (the Palm Springs Mayor) is running a solid race. He would be =
the first openly gay dad in Congress, as well as the first legally =
married gay man elected to Congress. Mary Bono Mack has always had some =
vulnerabilities, and it's time to take her out.
=20
14.	CA-44. Bill Hedrick. This is a district carried by Obama, and =
Hedrick is a solid candidate, and John Campbell is awful- a classic =
corporate conservative.
=20
15.	FL-08. Alan Grayson. Progressives need to be there for our most =
gutsy and outspoken progressive champion. His district is very =
competitive, and while he has raised a lot of money, he still needs =
support.
=20
16.	KS-3. Stephanie Moore. This is an open seat formerly held by Dennis =
Moore. Stephanie Moore is the Democratic candidate. This suburban Kansas =
City district is very competitive. I have talked to Moore and her =
campaign team. They are solidly committed to progressive reform causes, =
and seem to be running a strong race. I think we can keep this seat, but =
it will take a quick infusion of cash as she is being battered by the =
Republican attack machine.
=20

updates on a very regular basis between now and Election Day, but from a
different perspective than I usually do. Since I left the White House in =

election cycle I have been working from the outside of the party, =
focusing my
political work on 501(c)3, 501 (c)4, 527, and independent expenditure =
projects.
As many of you know, for several cycles now Carla Ohringer Engle and I =
have
organized conference calls and sent out update memoranda on this outside =
track.
This cycle, because of a project I agree to work on with MoveOn.org =
regarding
their cleaning up corporate corruption in Washington campaign, I am back =
to
working directly with candidates, campaigns, and party =
committees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

first is made up of the more conservative Democrats from more =
