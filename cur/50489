 Here is the hidden ball on this, Roy, if you communicate anyone on Team
Clinton.  Many in the media almost certainly have received private emails
from Republicans on the committees

investigating HRC.   The  Republicans know it, and the media knows it,  and
this whole issue

is a fraud waiting to explode on Republicans.  Not only do Republicans use
private email, but they use private email attacking the Clintons, and
someone in the media will blow their cover.

Once they attack HRC for private email they become fair game if they use
private email,  and if they use private email to attack the Clintons for
using private email, the  grenade explodes in their hands.  All it takes is
one reporter in possession of one dirty private email from one "name"
Republican  to blow them up, and sooner or later one of them will do
it....if they try to hide behind FOIA they look ridiculous and presumed
guilty and it would discredit the investigating committees in one fell
swoop.....
