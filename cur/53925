Fred,

Gary Hattem from Deutsche Bank said he may mention to you today his idea fo=
r joining with other philanthropists to create a standalone bank or fund (i=
nitially $20-50 million) that would finance goodworks globally including CG=
I commitments - both to support good works but also illuminate how the fina=
ncial community can come together to find models on how to finance this kin=
d of work at scale - especially at a time when they are being criticized. I=
 defer to others but seems like a good idea as a way to perpetuate and enha=
nce WJC's legacy - since financing for CGI commitments (and WJC's other goo=
d works) is a perpetual challenge. Obviously a lot of complexity around som=
ething like this but just flagging it for you. I told him WJC's name could =
not be affixed to it and that we couldn't help raise money for it since we =
have our hands full with CF endowment, etc. - and obviously that we'd have =
to figure out if and how we wanted to be involved in the governance of a ne=
w institution like this, if at all. He seems curious if he is able to put i=
t together, would we be open to announcing it in September. Seems like some=
thing ideally suited for the 10 year milestone. I told him it would be good=
 for a potential new institution like this to be open to considering CGI co=
mmitments as potential investment destinations. He said that's the point.

I defer to you folks, just passing it on and happy to discuss it anytime. S=
eems like a bigger and better and possibly more broadly supported version o=
f the Innovation Fund that Ira is talking about via CHAI.

Sincerely,
Ami
