Haha--I was literally just emailing Elan about this.  It's a public
poll but I don't like the trend so I was asking Elan how we should
proceed.  Might be worth taking a look.  I haven't spent much time
looking at the unh samples.  It also includes Warren which obviously
isn't a realistic reflection.  I'll have him do a memo for us.
