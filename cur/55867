Not surprisingly, the most disciplined presidential candidate in modern
times, President-elect Barack
Obama<http://www.washingtontimes.com/themes/?Theme=Barack+Obama>,
chose one of the Democratic Party's most disciplined personalities -- John
Podesta, a Clinton White House chief of staff -- to head up his early
transition team.

A thin, stern-looking man in photographs, Mr. Podesta was given the moniker
Skippy the Evil Twin by the staff when he was in a bad mood, according to
his brother, Tony Podesta, chairman of the Podesta Group, an influential
lobbying and public-affairs firm. Twenty years ago, the two brothers started
what has become one of Washington's most successful firms of its kind,
originally called Podesta Associates.

John Podesta, who will turn 60 on Jan. 8, went on in July 2003 to become
president and chief executive officer of the Center for American Progress, a
liberal public-policy think tank.

"He is 100 percent authentic; there isn't an ounce of guile in his body. A
straight shooter," says Lanny Davis, a former Clinton White House counsel
and partner in the Washington office of the law firm Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe LLP. "Sometimes that means he can be tough, and he was often tough
with me, but you always know where you stand with him."

Hard-boiled though he can be, his political dexterity is such that he
maintained the confidence of both Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Obama
in a cutthroat campaign year when both were running for the highest office
in the land.

He is a marathon runner, a mean cook and a discerning collector of
contemporary art. The brothers maintain a friendly rivalry when it comes to
their art collections. Both their houses in Northwest Washington are full of
personally chosen works.

The brothers have never had a serious fight, Tony Podesta says. Both are
Chicago-born of a Greek-American mother and an Italian-American father from
a blue-collar background, but they had moved on to Washington before Mr.
Obama came to work in the Windy City.

The brothers -- both are lawyers who married lawyers -- sponsored a
fundraiser for Mr. Obama when he was running for the Senate from Illinois.

John Podesta has taught a spring course with Judge Richard Leon on
congressional investigations for the past 12 years at Georgetown University
Law Center, where Mr. Podesta graduated in 1976.

"He is smart and has good judgment," says Judge Leon, a federal district
judge for the District of Columbia. "In a city with a lot of hidden agendas
and not a lot of humility, he is a very rare combination of personal
qualities -- genuinely humble and an honest broker."

Mr. Obama "said he bonded with John because they both are skinny -- a little
bit of a joke with truth in it," Tony Podesta recalls. The brothers and
their families are close and spent election night together at dinner in the
D.C. restaurant Tosca, celebrating John and Mary Podesta's 30th wedding
anniversary. They haven't yet planned how to celebrate John's 60th birthday,
Tony Podesta says.

John Podesta is not expected to have a permanent role in the new
administration he's helping put into place, but he will, his brother
suggests, return to his job at the Center for American Progress. "I think
John is an expert on policy and politics, and Obama couldn't find anybody
with the [same] breadth and depth of experience," Tony Podesta attests.

John Podesta's career has included stints as a trial lawyer in the Justice
Department, counselor to then-Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and
several other posts on Capitol Hill. He served in the White House from 1993
to 2001, becoming chief of staff in 1998.

On Wednesday, the Obama-Biden office named a triumvirate for managing the
transition going forward. The planning process is recognized formally as the
Obama-Biden Transition Project, a 501(c)4 organization to be overseen by
three co-chairmen: Mr. Podesta; Valerie Jarrett, a Chicago lawyer,
businesswoman and civic leader who is a senior adviser to Mr. Obama; and
Pete Rouse, the president-elect's chief of staff in the U.S. Senate.
