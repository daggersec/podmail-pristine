*McCain tour's theme: defiance (Columbus Dispatch 10/31/08)*
By Joe Hallett
DEFIANCE, Ohio -- Sen. John McCain began his sprint to the finish line
yesterday in this aptly named northwestern Ohio city, defiantly tilting
against the polls by predicting victory on Tuesday.
"The pundits have written us off, just as they have done several times
before," the Republican presidential nominee told several thousand
supporters at a middle school here. "We're a few points down, but we're
coming back."

rushed through northern Ohio on Thursday, Oct. 30, making five quick stops,
giving his well-worn stump speech and using new celeb Joe the Plumber to
help rally the crowds.
"We're coming back and we're going to win," McCain told a packed high schoo=
l
gymnasium at his last stop of the day.
He accused Democrat Barack Obama of "measuring the drapes" for the Oval
Office and planning tax increases with congressional leaders.

*
By ELISABETH BUMILLER
MENTOR, Ohio =97 In case anyone was wondering if Ohio was a combat zone for
Senator John McCain's presidential campaign, consider that five days before
the election the candidate took a 220-mile, six-stop, 12-hour bus tour
across the northern breadth of the state. Along the way, he deployed his
unofficial running mate, a disappearing and reappearing Joe the Plumber, to
try to drive his points home.
"I know history," Mr. McCain shouted out at a cold rally on Thursday mornin=
g
in Defiance, a place whose name summed up his mood. "I know the last time
anyone was elected president of the United States without carrying the stat=
e
of Ohio was John F. Kennedy. My friends, we're going to carry Ohio, and
we're going to win the presidency, and we need you out there working every
single moment over the next five days."

*McCain and Obama focus on differences on economy (LA Times 10/31/08)*
By Maeve Reston and Michael Finnegan
In his four public events across Ohio, McCain never specifically mentioned
the new reports, but spoke more broadly about the struggles of America's
middle class and promised "to get this economy out of the ditch."
Asked about the economic numbers in an interview with Fox News, McCain said
that "these are tough times" and that he was particularly concerned about
the slide in consumer confidence.
"It is of the utmost seriousness, and also I don't think, frankly, [we] hav=
e
focused on one of the real catalysts of the problem -- if not the catalyst
-- and that is home ownership," McCain told Fox before outlining his plan t=
o
buy up struggling homeowners' mortgages.

*McCain Pins Hopes on Getting Party Faithful to Polls in Ohio (WSJ 10/31/08=
)
*
By LAURA MECKLER
Heading into the crucial final weekend, Republicans say their operation is
even stronger and running ahead of where they were four years ago at this
time. They say their targeting is more efficient, their workers more
experienced and their technology better. The McCain campaign, using an
operation funded by the Republican National Committee, has already made 19.=
6
million phone calls this year nationwide. That's more than 2004, says Mike
DuHaime, Sen. McCain's political director. And 2004, he says, "was the gold
standard for turnout."
Officials expect to make more than 15 million contacts, including phone
calls and door knocks, just in these final days.

*In Final Stretch, McCain to Pour Money Into TV Ads (WaPo 10/31/08)*
By Matthew Mosk
Sen. John McCain and the Republican National Committee will unleash a
barrage of spending on television advertising that will allow him to keep
pace with Sen. Barack Obama's ad blitz during the campaign's final days, bu=
t
the expenditures will impact McCain's get-out-the-vote efforts, according t=
o
Republican strategists.
McCain has faced a severe spending imbalance during most of the fall, but
the Republican nominee squirreled away enough funds to pay for a raft of
television ads in critical battleground states over the next four days, sai=
d
Evan Tracey, a political analyst who monitors television spending. The
decision to finance a final advertising push is forcing McCain to curtail
spending on Election Day ground forces to help usher his supporters to the
polls, according to Republican consultants familiar with McCain's strategy.
The vaunted, 72-hour plan that President Bush used to mobilize voters in
2000 and 2004 has been scaled back for McCain. He has spent half as much as
Obama on staffing and has opened far fewer field offices. This week, a
number of veteran GOP operatives who orchestrate door-to-door efforts to ge=
t
voters to the polls were told they should not expect to receive plane
tickets, rental cars or hotel rooms from the campaign.

For Senator McCain, behind in a raft of crucial swing states with just days
to go before Election Day, the resurfaced recording isn't the game-changer
he needs. But it does add another piece to what can be called McCain's
"kitchen sink" final argument, in which he is summarizing all the charges
against Obama and personal associations that McCain hopes will sway
undecided voters and even some of the decided.

*McCain Turns Biden's Remarks Into Fresh Attacks Against Obama (WSJ

By LAURA MECKLER, CHRISTOPHER COOPER and ELIZABETH HOLMES
SANDUSKY, Ohio -- John McCain's campaign believes it has been handed two
winning arguments in the closing days of the presidential race, both
courtesy of Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Unscripted comments by Sen. Biden -- one on taxes, the other on
international affairs -- have given the Republican presidential nominee a
new way to contend that Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential
candidate, is a risk to voters' wallets and to national security.

*McCain Links Economy, Security (WaPo 10/31/08)*
By Michael Abramowitz
The Arizona Republican had once planned to make defense issues the central
theme of his presidential bid, but global economic turmoil has become a
relentless focus of his campaign in recent weeks. McCain sought to link the
two issues yesterday, arguing that, in a "Democratic-dominated Washington,"
national security and the economy would both suffer.
"Raising taxes and unilaterally renegotiating trade agreements as they have
promised would make a bad economy even worse, and undermine our national
security, even as they slash defense spending," McCain said in a speech in
Tampa after meeting with his national security advisers. "At least when
European nations chose the path of higher taxes and cutting defense, they
knew that their security would still be guaranteed by America. But if
America takes the same path, who will guarantee our security?"
The Illinois Democrat has not proposed cuts in defense spending and says he
wants to continue President Bush's plan to expand the military by 92,000
soldiers and Marines. But McCain seized on a recent call for a 25 percent
cut in Pentagon spending by Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) to stoke fears abou=
t
what would happen if Democrats controlled both Congress and the White House=
.

*McCain seeks to revive Rezko as campaign issue (AP 10/30/08)*
By CHRISTOPHER WILLS
CHICAGO (AP) -- Trailing as Election Day nears, Republican John McCain and
his allies are using "robo-calls" and fliers to revive the issue of Barack
Obama's ties to a convicted felon, claiming the Democrat hasn't fully
explained the relationship.
"Obama needs to come clean on this deal before the election so that the
voters can judge whether Obama received monetary benefits," says an
automated phone call by McCain's campaign about a financial transaction
between Illinois Sen. Obama and Antoin "Tony" Rezko.

*McCain Again Points to Obama's Associates (WaPo 10/31/08)*
By Michael D. Shear
MIAMI, Oct. 29 -- Sen. John McCain compared the director of Columbia
University's Middle East Institute to a "neo-Nazi" and called on the Los
Angeles Times to release a video of a 2003 banquet at which Sen. Barack
Obama talked about the professor, Rashid Khalidi, a leading Palestinian
American scholar and friend of Obama's from Chicago.
"What if there was a tape with John McCain with a neo-Nazi outfit being hel=
d
by some media outlet?" McCain asked in one of several interviews with Cuban
American radio stations Wednesday morning. "I think the treatment of the
issue would be slightly different."
McCain also alleged that Vietnam War-era radical William Ayers had been at
the banquet -- something that has not been reported by the Times -- adding
to a growing flap over the release of the videotape, which the Times said
had been provided by a source on the condition that the paper not air it.

*Fact check: Does group McCain chairs have link to Columbia professor
Khalidi? (CNN blog 10/30/08)*
The Statement
The campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama, on
Wednesday, October 29, responded to Republican opponent Sen. John McCain
criticism of Obama's relationship with Rashid Khalidi, an Arab studies
professor at Columbia University, by suggesting that McCain also had a link
to Khalidi. It said, "John McCain should answer why, under his own
chairmanship, the International Republican Institute repeatedly funded an
organization Khalidi founded, the Center for Palestine Research and Studies=
,
over the course of many years."
The Verdict: True. There was a relationship in the 1990s between the IRI,
chaired by McCain, and the CPRS, co-founded by Khalidi, which received IRI
funding.

How much better can it get for Joe the Plumber?
On Thursday, he had a candidate for president calling for him at a rally
where he was not present. At the next John McCain rally, he got to offer a
civics lesson to the crowd about how they should educate themselves before
voting. Then, at the final rally of the day, he had a crowd chanting his
name. OK, they weren't chanting his real name, Joe Wurzelbacher. They were
chanting, of course, "Joe-the-plumb-er!" in the same rhythm usually reserve=
d
for sporting events.
If that wasn't enough, McCain introduced Wurzelbacher as "an American hero,
a great citizen of Ohio and my role model."

WASHINGTON =97 Two weeks ago, senior Bush administration officials gathered=

exclusive Washington club a few blocks from the White House. The group was
there to deliver a grim message: the situation in Afghanistan is getting
worse.
Their audience: advisers from the presidential campaigns of John McCain and
Barack Obama.
Over two days, according to participants in the discussions, the experts
laid bare Afghanistan's most pressing issues. They sought to make clear tha=
t
the next president needed to have a plan for Afghanistan before he took
office on Jan. 20. Otherwise, they said, it could be too late.

*McCain Takes Unusual Tack With Transition Team*
By ANDY PASZTOR
Previous presidential transition efforts focused on vetting would-be
appointees, assembling hefty policy briefing books and making sure
politically reliable operatives were assigned as liaisons to departments an=
d
agencies. That's largely the path Democratic candidate Barack Obama has
chosen, assigning dozens of advisers to working groups. The participants
have strictly delineated responsibilities and must abide by specific
conflict-of-interest rules.
But aides say Sen. McCain's transition team, headed by former Navy Secretar=
y
Lehman, has a different, less-structured approach. Mr. Lehman and a small
group of aides are concentrating on the logistics of swiftly taking control
of the U.S. national security apparatus.

To be a college Republican in the face of Obama Nation takes a measure of
fortitude. For Ayendi, it also requires tons of prayer and caffeine.
McCain's poll numbers are sliding. Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaig=

is a bottomless pit of money and energy. Even the hay bales on the rolling
hills of once solidly GOP Lynchburg are painted red, white and blue with th=
e
name "Obama." And at Liberty University, founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell
in 1971, the first student Democratic club has sprung up.
For eight years, Liberty students have had one of their own in the White
House with George W. Bush: a conservative Christian who has spoken about hi=
s
conversion experience and funded abstinence-only sex education, appointed
two antiabortion Supreme Court justices and supported a constitutional ban
on same-sex marriage. A pipeline of jobs stretched from evangelical college=
s
such as Liberty to the executive branch.

*What sets McCain, Obama apart? The crowds, to start (McClatchy 10/30/08)*
By Steven Thomma
There are lots of differences traveling on the bus with John McCain and
Barack Obama in the closing days of the 2008 presidential campaign. The mos=
t
obvious is visible through the window, miles before it arrives at a campaig=
n
event.
As the Obama motorcade gets within two or three miles, it starts passing
people walking, carrying Obama posters, wearing Obama sweatshirts. Walking
from their cars, which they had to park far, far away. From about a block
away, the lines of people waiting to get in through the metal detectors
become visible. Sometimes hundreds, often thousands=85It's starkly differen=
t
on the McCain bus.
On a recent visit to Kettering, Ohio, for example, the McCain motorcade was
within a block of a local campus rally before there was any outward sign a
presidential campaign was arriving.
Inside, maybe 2,000 supporters waited, but dozens and dozens and dozens of
seats stood empty, and remained empty. At an outdoor rally that evening in
Lancaster, about 2,000 attended. Behind them, a wide open field.

supporters at a morning rally in Cape Girardeau, where she promised her

its wars and move toward energy independence.
Palin leveled some criticism at Obama, but focused mostly on how she and
McCain would tackle America's problems.
"Our ticket has the track record that proves we can do this," she said. "We

*Fact Check: Palin's Alaska spreads its wealth (AP 10/30/08)*
By RITA BEAMISH
But in Alaska, Palin is the envy of governors nationwide for the annual
checks the state doles out to nearly every resident, representing their
share of the revenues from the state's oil riches. She boosted those checks
this year by raising taxes on oil.
McCain campaign spokesman Taylor Griffin said Thursday that spreading wealt=
h
through Obama's tax plan and doing it through Alaska's oil-profit
distribution are not comparable because Alaska requires the state's resourc=
e
wealth to be shared with residents, but it's not taxing personal income.

*Palin says Obama infomercial short on specifics (AP 10/30/08)*
By DAN NEPHIN
ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said
Thursday that Democrat Barack Obama offered few national security specifics
in the infomercial he broadcast the night before, accusing him of trying to
"soften the focus" in the campaign's final days.
"In times of economic worry and hardship - crisis that we're in right now -
someone is attempting to put those concerns aside on Election Day - nationa=
l
security issues," Palin told about 6,000 people at a convention center
rally.
The Alaska governor said Obama had "wrapped his closing message in a warm
and fuzzy scripted infomercial intended to soften the focus in these closin=
g
days. He's hoping that your mind won't wander to the real challenges of
national security, challenges that he isn't capable of meeting."

The excitement/disappointment cycle of the past two elections has taken a

self-numbing. Their brains could register only so much outrage before they
became desensitized and began to rewire themselves to adapt. Oliver Stone's

Security Should Be the Deciding Issue (WSJ 10/31/08)
By FREDERICK W. KAGAN
The health of our economy rests on its fundamentals, and on the way the
entire government -- the president, the Congress, the Federal Reserve, and
the courts -- approach the problem. The lives of American citizens rest on
the way the president interacts with our enemies. When people feel
relatively safe, they vote their pocketbooks. When they feel endangered,
they vote for security. The world today offers no reason for Americans to
feel safe. If we want safety, we have to be ready to fight for it.

Misreading the Verdict (WaPo 10/31/08)
By Michael Gerson
After every Republican loss -- whatever the proximate cause -- it is worth
recalling the words of Whittaker Chambers: "If the Republican Party cannot
get some grip of the actual world we live in and from it generalize and
actively promote a program that means something to masses of people -- why
somebody else will. . . . The Republican Party will become like one of thos=
e
dark little shops which apparently never sell anything. If, for any reason,
you go in, you find, at the back, an old man, fingering for his own
pleasure, some oddments of cloth. . . . Nobody wants to buy them, which is
fine because the old man is not really interested in selling. He just likes
to hold and to feel."
That remains the Republican choice: to offer a message for the masses or to
remain in business merely for its own ideological pleasure.

Back to a Big-Tent GOP?  (WSJ 10/31/08)
By KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL
The GOP's problems are a result of a failure of action, not of philosophy.
Everything, including this election, shows we remain a center-right country=

If Barack Obama wins, it will be because he has doggedly (if not always
believably) run to the right on everything from national security
(wiretapping) to "tax cuts," guns and social issues.
Democrats may also achieve big gains in the House and Senate. But their win=

in 2006 were the result of the party's decision to run "conservative"
candidates -- pro-life, pro-gun and populist on economics. Democratic gains
this year will come via similar candidates. The nation hasn't moved left;

Referendum on Trickle-Down (WaPo 10/31/08)

Obama and the Runaway Train (WSJ 10/31/08)
By PEGGY NOONAN
The case for Barack Obama, in broad strokes:
He has within him the possibility to change the direction and tone of
American foreign policy, which need changing; his rise will serve as a
practical rebuke to the past five years, which need rebuking; his victory
would provide a fresh start in a nation in which a fresh start would come a=
s
a national relief. He climbed steep stairs, born off the continent with no
father to guide, a dreamy, abandoning mother, mixed race, no connections. H=
e
rose with guts and gifts. He is steady, calm, and, in terms of the executio=
n
of his political ascent, still the primary and almost only area in which hi=
s
executive abilities can be discerned, he shows good judgment in terms of
whom to hire and consult, what steps to take and moves to make. We witnesse=

from him this year something unique in American politics: He took down a
political machine without raising his voice.

McCain for President, Part II (WaPo 10/31/08)

The national security choice in this election is no contest. The domestic

An 'Idiot Wind': John McCain's latest attempt to link Barack Obama to
extremism (WaPo 10/31/08)
Editorial
It's fair to question why Mr. Obama felt as comfortable as he apparently di=
d
during his Chicago days in the company of men whose views diverge sharply
from what the presidential candidate espouses. Our sense is that Mr. Obama
is a man of considerable intellectual curiosity who can hear out a smart, i=
f
militant, advocate for the Palestinians without compromising his own
position. To suggest, as Mr. McCain has, that there is something
reprehensible about associating with Mr. Khalidi is itself condemnable --
especially during a campaign in which Arab ancestry has been the subject of
insults. To further argue that the Times, which obtained the tape from a
source in exchange for a promise not to publicly release it, is trying to
hide something is simply ludicrous, as Mr. McCain surely knows. Which
reminds us: We did ask Mr. Khalidi whether he wanted to respond to the
campaign charges against him. He answered, via e-mail, that "I will stick t=
o
my policy of letting this idiot wind blow over." That's good advice for
anyone still listening to the McCain campaign's increasingly reckless ad
hominem attacks. Sadly, that wind is likely to keep blowing for four more
days.

My view of Sarah Palin has changed in the two months since John McCain name=

changing, too, and not entirely in a good way.
I thought Palin was a lightweight; she's not. I thought she was an ingenue;
she is, but only as long as her claws are sheathed. I thought she was
bewildered and star-struck at her sudden elevation to national prominence;
if she ever was, she isn't anymore. I thought she was nothing but raw
political talent and unrealistic ambition; it turns out that she has
impressive political skills. I thought she was destined to become nothing
more than a historical footnote; I now think that Democrats underestimate
her at their peril.

*A Last Push To Deregulate (WaPo 10/31/08)*
By R. Jeffrey Smith
The White House is working to enact a wide array of federal regulations,
many of which would weaken government rules aimed at protecting consumers
and the environment, before President Bush leaves office in January.
The new rules would be among the most controversial deregulatory steps of
the Bush era and could be difficult for his successor to undo. Some would
ease or lift constraints on private industry, including power plants, mines
and farms.
Those and other regulations would help clear obstacles to some commercial
ocean-fishing activities, ease controls on emissions of pollutants that
contribute to global warming, relax drinking-water standards and lift a key
restriction on mountaintop coal mining.
Once such rules take effect, they typically can be undone only through a
laborious new regulatory proceeding, including lengthy periods of public
comment, drafting and mandated reanalysis.

parties begin filing the inevitable lawsuits over voting irregularities,
experts say.
The battles could be over the rules for a recount, or how to deal with
voters who were not added to the rolls even though they registered properly
and on time. Lawyers could fight over how to count the paper ballots used
when the electronic machines break down, or whether a judge was correct in
deciding to keep certain polls open late.
But the most likely source of litigation is the state's heavy use of
provisional ballots, which are issued when a voter's identity or
registration cannot immediately be verified or when polls stay open late.
Ohio has a history of requiring large numbers of voters to use these
ballots, which are easy to disqualify and are not counted until after the
election.

*Can the System Handle Huge Voter Turnout? (ABC News 10/30/08)*
By ARIANE de VOGUE
A record number of Americans are voting early this year, and Election Day
turnout is expected to be so high that experts predict long, snaking lines
-- and plenty of legal challenges.
If the turnout is as big as expected, and the race is close, lawyers for
both parties could file challenges on issues related to provisional and
absentee ballots, the expertise of poll workers, the efficacy of voting
machines and the hours of operation at polling places.
"A key question," says Edward B. Foley, of Moritz College of Law at Ohio
State University, "is whether the infrastructure can handle the volume that
we will see."
The pressure on the system will be eased in those states where voters have
taken advantage of the early vote, but in a battleground state such as
Pennsylvania, with no early vote, experts hope that election officials have
adequately prepared the system.

Mr. McCain would cut taxes generally on par with Mr. Obama for those making

a

question is emerging in the battleground state: Who is going to help whom
the most on Election Day?
Some Democrats think that popular former governor and Senate hopeful Mark R=
.
Warner (D) might do something unusual in a presidential election year: Help
the top of his ticket.
But some Republicans warn that if Warner draws voters in traditionally
conservative parts of the state, they could split their vote, and he could
inadvertently end up helping McCain (R). Others say McCain's strength in
military strongholds and elsewhere can work in favor of Warner's opponent,
James S. Gilmore III, a former Republican governor.

*Embattled congresswoman holds debate in Minnesota (AP 10/30/08)*
By Martiga Lohn
In her debate with Elwyn Tinklenberg, Bachmann said constituents are not
bringing up the comment she made on MSNBC's "Hardball" almost two weeks ago
-- a statement that reshaped the race in Minnesota's 6th District. Bachmann
said people are more concerned about taxes and the Wall Street bailout.
"It's not a part of the campaign and it's not what people are interested
in," she said during the debate at Minnesota Public Radio studios in St.
Paul. "If they were, that's something we'd be talking about, but that isn't
what people have been asking me about."
She added: "The only people who bring that up are the media. It's not the
people."

*'Blue Dog' Democrats ready to bark louder on Hill (AP 10/30/08)*
By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative Democrats who've been a thorn in the side o=
f
liberal party leaders could grow into a major obstacle to Barack Obama's
agenda if he is elected president.
Majority Democrats are positioned for big gains in next week's congressiona=
l
election. But many of the new faces would join a growing chorus of "Blue
Dogs" who often part from the party base on big issues like taxes and
increasing federal spending.
That could set up a roadblock for Obama, who has promised to broaden health
insurance coverage, start a new round of public works projects and improve
early childhood education, among other things - all initiatives that would
require substantial government spending at a time of soaring deficits.

*Stevens Can Vote Despite Felony Conviction (AP 10/30/08)*
WASHINGTON =97  GOP Sen. Ted Stevens' felony conviction won't block him fro=
m
casting a vote for himself in Tuesday's election.
Stevens was convicted Monday on seven counts of trying to hide more than
$250,000 in free home renovations and other gifts that he received from a
wealthy oil contractor. Alaska law says "a person convicted of a crime that
constitutes a felony involving moral turpitude under state or federal law
may not vote in a state, federal, or municipal election from the date of th=
e
conviction through the date of the unconditional discharge of the person."
But state legal officials say that since Stevens has not been sentenced yet=
,
he is eligible to vote in the general election, said Gail Fenumiai, directo=
r
of the Alaska Division of Elections.

POLLS
*Poll: Obama-Biden 13 points up in national poll (AP 10/30/08)
*THE NUMBERS: Barack Obama-Joe Biden 52 percent, John McCain-Sarah Palin 39
percent.
OF INTEREST: The Democrats have a 13-point lead when Bob Barr and Ralph
Nader are included. Obama-Biden lead by 52-41 if the race is narrowed only
to the Democrats and Republicans. More than two-thirds of voters feel Barac=
k
Obama could work well with members of the opposing party. More than half sa=
y
he is prepared for the job of president. And almost half are confident he
could handle an international crisis. But more than half of McCain's
supporters say they are scared of an Obama presidency. Obama leads McCain b=
y
20 points among those who have already voted. And the number of people who
say Palin is not prepared to be vice president increased from 50 percent to
59 percent in the last month.

Growing Doubts on Palin Take a Toll, Poll Finds (NYT 10/31/08)*
By MICHAEL COOPER and DALIA SUSSMAN
A growing number of voters have concluded that Senator John McCain's runnin=
g
mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, is not qualified to be vice president,
weighing down the Republican ticket in the last days of the campaign,
according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
All told, 59 percent of voters surveyed said Ms. Palin was not prepared for
the job, up nine percentage points since the beginning of the month. Nearly
a third of voters polled said the vice-presidential selection would be a
major factor influencing their vote for president, and those voters broadly
favor Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee.
And in a possible indication that the choice of Ms. Palin has hurt Mr.
McCain's image, voters said they had much more confidence in Mr. Obama to
pick qualified people for his administration than they did in Mr. McCain.

Their audience: advisers from the presidential campaigns of John McCain and=

By ANDY PASZTOR<br>Previous presidential transition efforts focused on vett=

sure politically reliable operatives were assigned as liaisons to departmen=
ts and agencies. That&#39;s largely the path Democratic candidate Barack Ob=
ama has chosen, assigning dozens of advisers to working groups. The partici=
pants have strictly delineated responsibilities and must abide by specific =
conflict-of-interest rules.<br>
But aides say Sen. McCain&#39;s transition team, headed by former Navy Secr=
etary Lehman, has a different, less-structured approach. Mr. Lehman and a s=
mall group of aides are concentrating on the logistics of swiftly taking co=

It&#39;s fair to question why Mr. Obama felt as comfortable as he apparentl=
y did during his Chicago days in the company of men whose views diverge sha=
rply from what the presidential candidate espouses. Our sense is that Mr. O=
bama is a man of considerable intellectual curiosity who can hear out a sma=
rt, if militant, advocate for the Palestinians without compromising his own=
 position. To suggest, as Mr. McCain has, that there is something reprehens=
ible about associating with Mr. Khalidi is itself condemnable -- especially=
 during a campaign in which Arab ancestry has been the subject of insults. =
To further argue that the Times, which obtained the tape from a source in e=
xchange for a promise not to publicly release it, is trying to hide somethi=
ng is simply ludicrous, as Mr. McCain surely knows. Which reminds us: We di=
d ask Mr. Khalidi whether he wanted to respond to the campaign charges agai=
nst him. He answered, via e-mail, that &quot;I will stick to my policy of l=
etting this idiot wind blow over.&quot; That&#39;s good advice for anyone s=
till listening to the McCain campaign&#39;s increasingly reckless ad homine=
m attacks. Sadly, that wind is likely to keep blowing for four more days.<b=

<br><b>&#39;Blue Dog&#39; Democrats ready to bark louder on Hill (AP 10/30/=
08)</b><br>By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS<br>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative Dem=
ocrats who&#39;ve been a thorn in the side of liberal party leaders could g=
row into a major obstacle to Barack Obama&#39;s agenda if he is elected pre=
sident.<br>
Majority Democrats are positioned for big gains in next week&#39;s congress=
ional election. But many of the new faces would join a growing chorus of &q=
uot;Blue Dogs&quot; who often part from the party base on big issues like t=
axes and increasing federal spending.<br>
That could set up a roadblock for Obama, who has promised to broaden health=
 insurance coverage, start a new round of public works projects and improve=
 early childhood education, among other things - all initiatives that would=
 require substantial government spending at a time of soaring deficits.<br>

Toll, Poll Finds (NYT 10/31/08)</b><br>
By MICHAEL COOPER and DALIA SUSSMAN<br>A growing number of voters have conc=
luded that Senator John McCain's running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, =
is not qualified to be vice president, weighing down the Republican ticket =
in the last days of the campaign, according to the latest New York Times/CB=
S News poll.<br>
All told, 59 percent of voters surveyed said Ms. Palin was not prepared for=
 the job, up nine percentage points since the beginning of the month. Nearl=
y a third of voters polled said the vice-presidential selection would be a =
major factor influencing their vote for president, and those voters broadly=
 favor Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee.<br>
And in a possible indication that the choice of Ms. Palin has hurt Mr. McCa=
in's image, voters said they had much more confidence in Mr. Obama to pick =
qualified people for his administration than they did in Mr. McCain.<br>
