Hillary Clinton unveiled a =E2=80=9Cnew college compact,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93=
 a $350 billion proposal
=E2=80=93 as part of her 2016 Presidential platform this week, promising to=
 ease
the cost of higher education and in the same breath, reduce student debt.

In the broader proposal, Clinton proposes that states =E2=80=9Cwill have to=
 step
up=E2=80=A6by maintaining current levels of higher education funding and
reinvesting their time,=E2=80=9D and also require college and universities =
to
control their costs to make tuition affordable, among other points.

However, Clinton also includes provisions specifically meant to cater to
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including a dedicated $25
billion fund to provide support to private HBCUs, targeting low and
middle-income students and helping them build the skills they need.

Regardless of public or private status, Clinton=E2=80=99s plan also propose=
s the
following for all HBCUs:

   - Significant cuts to the interest rates that students pay on any loans
   they take out so that the government never profits on the loans.
   - Enables students with debt to refinance their loans at low current
   rates.
   - Parents with PLUS loans will also be able to refinance at current
   rates.
   - Extends the American Opportunity Tax Credit with its $1,000 refundable
   credit to low-income families sending their sons and daughters to these
   schools.
   - Ensures that parents who borrow through the Parent PLUS program will
   not have to take out such high levels of debt in order to send their
   children and grandchildren to these schools.
   - Enables students never to have to repay more than 10 percent of their
   monthly income.
   - Builds on programs such as TRIO and GEAR UP to invest in student
   support, including childcare for students who are parents, to help all
   students stay in school and boost completion.

"Hillary Clinton is committed to making college affordable for all of South
Carolina=E2=80=99s students and families. Her proposal for a federal-state
partnership is an innovative idea that will help lower the skyrocketing
cost of higher education," state Sen. Darrell Jackson, a graduate of
private HBCU Benedict College, said in a press release.


*NBC Black: Hillary Clinton Targets HBCUs in College Affordability Plan*

The middle class and American Dream are again in the spotlight as the 2016
presidential campaign is taking shape, and as part of her pitch, Democratic
presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has rolled out a plan to make
college more accessible and affordable to a key constituency - black
parents and children attending historically black colleges.

"We're going to work closely with (HBCUs) ... because they serve some of
America's brightest students, who need the most support and too often have
gotten the least of it," Clinton wrote this week in announcing the New
College Compact
<https://medium.com/@HillaryClinton/the-new-college-compact-73652df9543c>
 and highlighting
<https://www.hillaryclinton.com/p/briefing/factsheets/2015/08/12/college-co=
mpact-hbcu/>
her
support for HBCUs.

Under the plan, students at public HBCUs could attend community colleges
for free and would not have to take out loans at four-year institutions
through federal-state funding partnerships. It includes a $25 billion fund
to support low- and middle-income students at private HBCUs - often left
off the table in discussions about college affordability, despite their
role in educating students with similar financial challenges.

The proposal also addresses hefty student loan repayments, which can often
handicap all young people as they start life after college, making it
harder to build wealth. Clinton's plan would cap repayments at 10 percent
of monthly income.
*"WE'RE NOT JUST IMPORTANT CONSTITUENTS; WE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN
MOVING THE NATION FORWARD."*

Several HBCU presidents and stakeholders, including some who spoke with the
Clinton campaign this week, praised the early details of the plan.
Supporters noted that HBCUs have gotten some of the political spotlight in
recent years, with President Obama signing an executive order
<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/promoting-excellence-innovatio=
n-and-sustainability-historically-black-colleges-and->
that
established an HBCU initiative and called for Congress to give $2 billion
to black colleges in 2010. GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul visited
Howard University in 2013 and Bowie State University in March in an effort
to reach out to black voters.

Dillard University President Walter Kimbrough said the proposal makes sense
for schools like his, with a higher percentage of Pell grant-eligible
students than most community colleges in Louisiana, despite being a private
institution. With renewed attention on community colleges, Kimbrough
suggested targeting black schools is also part of the solution to address
the access gap.

"If you're going to create a new program geared towards low-income
students, our sector enrolls more than anyone," said Kimbrough. "We're not
just important constituents; we play an important role in moving the nation
forward."

Baltimore's Morgan State University President David Wilson called the
proposal "revolutionary" and "potentially transformative" for students who
want to go to college but can't afford to.

"Many of them are losing their drive and the ambition to even pursue a
college education," Wilson said. "This is the population that's growing in
America."

The country's 105 public and private HBCUs represent three percent of
colleges and universities and enroll 10 percent of African-American
undergraduates, but produce one in five black college graduates. The
overwhelming majority either take out student loans to pay for school or
come from families with an income that qualifies them for federal Pell
grants.

If elected, Hillary Clinton wants a 25 billion dollar college payment plan
for historically black universities and colleges in South Carolina. Under
Clinton's New College Compact students wouldn't have to take out a loan to
earn four-year degrees =E2=80=93 wouldn't pay a dime to earn two-year degre=
es. The
new funds will help schools lower attendance costs and help improve student

The Times and Democrat

August 13, 2015

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton says her =E2=80=9Cnew col=
lege
compact=E2=80=9D will include support for private colleges, including South
Carolina's private historically black colleges and universities.

Calling for a =E2=80=9Cnew college compact,=E2=80=9D Clinton on Monday unve=
iled a $350
billion plan aimed at making college more affordable and reducing student
debt.

The proposal centers on a $200 billion federal incentive system aimed at
encouraging states to expand their investments in higher education and cut
student costs. States that guarantee "no-loan" tuition at four-year public
schools and free tuition at community colleges would be eligible to receive
federal funds.

It also includes a $25 billion fund to support private nonprofit schools
that serve low- and middle-income students and help them build the skills
they need, of which private HBCUs are a prime example, her campaign said in
a release.
