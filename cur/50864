Aw thank you everybody. That is one good looking team!! I'm so glad you all h=
ad fun. I know I did. It's a secret in the Ragnar staff that it's actually m=
ore fun to volunteer at a Ragnar than to run one. I agree, and I look forwar=
d to organizing next year and seeing you all again. With better weather, I b=
et Abbey could even come cheer with me. Maybe one day I'll get around to act=
ually running in one!

Many thanks to Gabe for volunteering at the starting line with me on Thursda=
y--he got me out of a 2 am volunteer shift that would have been just a littl=
e too much for me!

One more administrative note: you'll hear from me again on settling up. If y=
ou paid anything, let me know. I'll spread that into the total and remove yo=
ur portion from what you send to John. Gabe especially, who covered Costco a=
nd Van 2. So let me know if you paid for gas, a car wash, or anything big fo=
r the good of the team.=20

Til next year!!
