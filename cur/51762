Dear John,



Now that the U.S. has become home for Michael and me (my third home after
Mexico and Germany), I would like to engage politically again and
contribute to Hillary's campaign. As you know, politics has always been my
passion and I am a long term and loyal admirer of HRC, so for me, the time
is now: Could you use a Mexican/German-U.S. resident in the campaign?



I know that the set of skills needed in a Presidential campaign are
specific and differ from what I learned in Germany, the Balkans and Latin
America. Hence, I have no illusions, but here is what I could bring to the
table:



-- Knowledge of Latin America and a good understanding of the Latino
community as well as Latino organizations in the United States;

-- Strong communication skills, especially in Spanish but also in English,
German, French, and Portuguese;

-- Reading politics: I worked in party politics most of my life and had to
learn to quickly grasp complicated political surroundings as diverse as
Bonn, Belgrade or Brasilia. Therefore, I am confident, that I could get
Colorado or Ohio, too.

-- Policy expertise in climate change, renewable energy and international
affairs;

-- Experience in parliament, government, think tanks, NGOs and a large,
bureaucratic financial institution

-- I am a fast learner, committed, and will do what it takes. I would not
have gone from Mexico, to Germany, to Belgrade, to Washington, to Brasilia
and back to Washington otherwise.



I can barely imagine the amount of requests you get these days, so I know
this is a long shot but I decided to try, because this is our new home and
Michael and I want to be part of America in every way. If you think I could
make a useful contribution somewhere in the campaign, I would be thrilled.

Saludos,

Helga
