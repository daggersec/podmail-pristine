=20
Time to Stand Up for the Public  Sector=20

For over forty years, the right wing has mounted an irrepressible  campaign=
=20
to discredit the very concept of government in the United  States.   =20
It continued its campaign to demonize government even as we watched first =
=20
responders=97government employees -- run into the collapsing twin towers to=
=20
rescue  their fellow citizens on September 11, 2001.  They continued to def=
ame=20
the concept of  government in the face of daily reports of the bravery and=
=20
sacrifice of our  soldiers in Iraq and  Afghanistan =96 all  representing t=
he=20
Government of the United States of America.  =20
The Right even continued this drum beat in the face of the most =20
spectacular recent failure of its anti-public sector philosophy =96 the 200=
8  financial=20
collapse. They simply ignored what was obvious to the entire world:  that=
=20
today=92s economic crisis was caused by the fact that Republicans had =20
essentially ended effective public sector oversight of the big Wall Street =
Banks =20
whose greed and recklessness caused the worst economic crisis in 60 years a=
nd =20
cost eight million Americans their jobs. =20
In the Republican moral universe, the private sector is good, and the =20
public sector is evil =96 it=92s as simple as that.=20
This week, the new House Republican Majority rode into Washington, DC to=20
promote an anti-public sector agenda  that is overtly aimed at shrinking th=
e =93
evil=94 Federal  government.=20
Progressives can no longer allow the radical right to define the concept =
=20
of Government in the United  States. It=92s time to proudly and forcefully =
=20
stand up for the public sector. =20
The Progressive concept of government is rooted in the Declaration of=20
Independence:=20
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, =
=20
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, tha=
t =20
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure=
=20
these  rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just=20
powers from  the consent of the governed.=20
Wall Street  banks are not instituted to secure these rights =96 neither ar=
e=20
giant  international corporations, nor private insurance companies, nor big=
=20
oil  conglomerates. Democratic governments are instituted to protect and=20
advance  those unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of=20
happiness.  Government is the vehicle through which  we assure that the not=
ion that =93
all men are created equal=94 is realized in the  real world because it is t=
he=20
only institution in society that represents all of  us, where =96 at least=
=20
theoretically =96 every American is equal and has equal power  to shape soc=
iety=92
s goals. =20
Government is the place where democracy lives.  It is, as Congressman=20
Barney Frank says,  the name we give for the things we choose to do togethe=
r. =20
The wealthy elites that dominate the American Right have financed the =20
campaign to demonize government because they want the opportunity to pursue=
 a =20
very different group of values that have nothing to do with America=92s =20
founding principles.  They want the  right to concentrate more and more wea=
lth and=20
power into their own  hands.=20
They are not interested in =93democracy=94 or the notion that =93all men an=
d =20
women are created equal.=94  They are  devoted to plutocracy =96 to the not=
ion=20
that they should have the unfettered  ability to accumulate a larger and=20
larger share of the fruits of our economy =96  and more and more control ov=
er the=20
natural resources that belong to us  all.=20
For the last forty years, the Right=92s attempts to demonize government is =
=20
one of the reasons why the wealthy and big Wall Street banks have been=20
allowed  to siphon off a greater and greater share of the nation=92s wealth=
 from the=20
middle  class.  For the last twenty years,  middle class incomes have been=
=20
stagnant.  Every dime of economic growth has ultimately flowed to the top 2=
%=20
of the  population.=20
Today the distribution of wealth is more polarized than at any other time =
=20
since 1928.  Today, the top one  percent of the population controls as much=
=20
total wealth as does the bottom 90%.  =20
The Right=92s campaign to demonize government was intended to create the =
=20
backdrop for its successful attempts to end the oversight of the big Wall=
=20
Street  banks that had prevented a recurrence of the Great Depression for m=
ore=20
than 50  years. They wanted to be free to make huge sums of money through=
=20
speculation and  financial schemes that allowed them unimaginable rates of=
=20
return =96 but risked  the stability of the entire economy. =20
They succeeded in eliminating that oversight. They gambled on everything =
=20
-- with everyone else=92s money. They collapsed the economy, they got baile=
d=20
out =96  and many of them are still raking in multi-million dollar bonuses =
while=20
millions  of their victims remain unemployed. =20
Now one of the key items of the Republican agenda is to eviscerate the =20
newly-passed Wall Street Reform legislation that is one of the most importa=
nt =20
accomplishments of the Obama Administration and Democratic  Congress.=20
But that=92s not all.  The new  Republican House majority wants to repeal t=
he=20
health care reform law to allow  private insurance companies once again to=
=20
have free rein to deny care to those  with pre-existing conditions, revoke=
=20
coverage when people get sick, and raise  rates whenever they please.  They=
 =20
rail against the cost of health care while protecting a bloated private=20
sector  system that requires that Americans pay twice as much per capita fo=
r=20
health care  than the citizens of any other industrial democracy =96 and ge=
t=20
health care  outcomes that rank only 37th in the world.=20
The Republicans want to pass new legislation easing the way for states to =
=20
file for bankruptcy so they can void union contracts, and cut public =20
services.=20
They have passed new =93cut-as-you-go=94 rules for the House which require =
=20
that in order to spend a new dollar on a critical public service, the new =
=20
expenditure must be paid for by a cut in some other expenditure =96 never b=
y any =20
increase in revenue.  =20
Worse, their rules do not require that tax cuts =96 including tax cuts for =
=20
the rich =96 be paid for by anything.  So much for their alleged concern fo=
r=20
the deficit. =20
In fact, the Right has never really been concerned about the  deficit. =20
Remember that only a  decade ago, the Federal Government had budget surplus=
es=20
as far as the eye could  see.  But beginning in 2001, the  Bush=20
Administration and Republican Congress cut taxes for the rich and launched =
 two=20
unpaid-for wars that created a ballooning Federal deficit.  Right wing lead=
er Grover=20
Norquist was  quite explicit that the Republicans created that deficit=20
intentionally to generate the political  and financial pressure to shrink t=
he=20
role of government. =20
And, of course, the Right has never let the facts stand in its way.  You=20
have to admire how brazenly they are  willing to distort reality.  Republic=
ans=20
argue daily that cutting government spending =96 even in the  near term =96=
=20
will create jobs, when from an economic point of view exactly the  opposite=
 is=20
true.=20
Virtually every mainstream economist in America  agrees that funds for=20
unemployment compensation, infrastructure projects, food  stamps, funding t=
o=20
prevent the layoffs of teachers, and firefighters and police  officers are =
the=20
best ways to create jobs =96 and multiples of economic activity,  since=20
expenditures are used by everyday consumers to buy products and services  f=
rom=20
businesses in local communities. =20
And one thing we have learned all over again as a result of the 2008 =20
economic collapse: a strong, vibrant public sector is necessary to assure a=
=20
strong, vibrant  private sector. =20
For the private sector to prosper,  countries need an economic environment=
=20
that includes high-quality public  education, safe secure communities, an=
=20
effective healthcare system, and an  efficient transportation and=20
communications infrastructure.  A strong public sector is necessary to  pro=
vide that=20
environment.=20
And a clear, strong set of rules is necessary to prevent powerful  economic=
=20
elites from engaging in activity that threatens the entire economy =96  and=
=20
to create clear expectations that allow entrepreneurs to make long-term =20
investments with confidence.  All of  that requires a strong public sector.=
=20
In fact, a strong public sector is necessary to assure competitive  markets=
=20
that would otherwise be dominated by the largest, most powerful economic =
=20
actors.=20
Progressives believe that there is an important role for private markets =
=20
and private economic activity =96 and that there is also an indispensable r=
ole=20
for  public sector economic activity. =20
Intentional attempts by the Republican right to demonize and weaken =20
government do not ultimately strengthen the private sector in  America. =20
Individual actors may strengthen their  own domination of our economy and s=
ociety =96=20
and concentrate wealth in their own  hands.  But the long-term effect =96  =
as=20
we have seen over the last two years =96 is to weaken private sector econom=
ic =20
activity and destroy the quality of our lives. =20
In fact,  long-term economic growth requires widely-shared economic growth.=
=20
 It requires a strong middle class that  has money in its pockets to buy=20
products and services.  Widely-shared economic growth does not  happen if t=
he=20
wealthiest corporations are allowed to use their disproportionate  economic=
=20
power to dominate our economy and society.  Only a strong public sector can=
=20
assure  widely-shared prosperity.=20
Finally, we must remember that the public sector is the one place in =20
society where =96 at least in theory -- all of us participate as equals. Fo=
r over =20
two centuries America has struggled to perfect its  government to actually=
=20
embody that ideal.  The Supreme Court=92s decision in the Citizens United c=
ase=20
that allowed  corporations to spend unlimited sums on elections =96 and=20
conferred on them even  more rights of =93personhood=94 -- was a blow to ma=
king that=20
ideal a reality.   But if we are ever to make that  democratic ideal a=20
reality, it will only be through government.   Every person does not stand =
as an =20
equal in the private sector economic marketplace.  We each cast our =93doll=
ar=20
votes,=94 which  vary enormously between us =96 and are concentrated in the=
=20
hands of giant  conglomerates or Wall Street banks. =20
But we do stand equal before the ballot box.  And we can work to make us=20
all equal in  our access to public education, or health care, or public=20
services =96 when it  comes to the baseline access to the resources that ar=
e=20
necessary for each of us  to fulfill our potential and exercise actual free=
dom. =20
Only democratic government can make that happen, and it is time for us to =
=20
stand up for democratic government with the same ardor as those who first=
=20
wrote  that to protect our unalienable rights, governments are instituted=
=20
among men. =20
