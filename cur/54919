John,

One Big Thing: I didn=E2=80=99t have the right moment to appropriately =
thank you for putting in a good word on my behalf with Lisa Jackson =E2=80=
=94 you saw her the Monday after I had a soft interview with her.  The =
conversation is still developing, but I am angling hard to land a "Jared =
Cohen Google Ideas=E2=80=9D like role under her and Tim Cook, ideally =
with a start date next year so I can still knock out a few of the tech =
things for Salman & Susan Rice.

Also, Madeleine Albright has just invited me to join the 34th Street =
Group, which I am greatly looking forward to participating in.

You in DC this coming weekend or next? =20

Can I keep you company on a run?

Chris
