*The McCain Campaign: A Day in the Life* (ABC 07/29/08 6:53pm)
KATIE COURIC: [=85] There's the presidential candidate with a message that'=
s
defined, defended, and disseminated daily by an army of about 400 at the
McCain headquarters in Arlington, VA. This campaign is led by not one, but
two generals. The first, an operative skilled in tactics and mechanics,
honed as campaign manager for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steve Schmidt.

STEVE SCHMIDT: I work to run the day-to-day operations of the campaign and
involved in the strategy, talking to Senator McCain. Help directing the
activities here, you know, at the campaign headquarters and out across the
nation to help deliver the Senator's message.

COURIC: The campaign's other commanding officer, Rick Davis, is a longtime
ally. He's fought many political battles alongside McCain, including his
presidential run in 2000.

Why do you think you've lasted so long?

RICK DAVIS: I don't know, I just keep showing up. You know, nobody tells me
to leave so at 7 o'clock in the morning I'm here and trying to do what I ca=
n
to try to help the campaign.

COURIC: Is it a problem to not have a single person who's in charge of the
entire operation?

DAVIS: You know, if you dial it back a couple of weeks, I was doing all of
it. I went to McCain and said, look, I need help.

COURIC: The war room and its lieutenants are on defense. Charged with
monitoring the non-stop media coverage with plenty of sugar and caffeine at
the ready.  [=85] The communications team plays offense, making sure the
candidate's message is relayed and repeated.

In this modern media age the points and counterpoints come fast and furious=
,
through every conceivable outlet. The campaign also tries to reach out to
all kinds of voting blocks, including women, Hispanics, and African
Americans. The efforts are coordinated by Aaron Minaigo.

You are an African American man supporting John McCain, obviously, do your
friends give you a hard time at all?

AARON MINAIGO: No, absolutely. Most of my friends, they like John McCain. I=
n
any other election year, they'd probably be right here working with us.

COURIC: A regiment of advanced personnel choreographs every detail of every
trip and appearance. [=85]

Did you decide the hot dog stand today?

CARLA EUDY: Well, no. The guy on the ground sent a photo and was like this
is the perfect place.

COURIC: Another challenge for the advance team, orchestrating the events
that McCain has made his trademark, town hall meetings. The communications
team back at headquarters and traveling with the candidate constantly looks
for ways to refine and strengthen his message. [=85] But the mother of all
appearances will be in Minneanapolis in September. When McCain accepts his
party's nomination. And the pressure is on Mark Salter. He's co-written fiv=
e
books with the Senator, and on this day he's heading to Maine to work on,
perhaps, the biggest speech of his life.
Do you have any ideas?

MARK SALTER: No, not a one, to be honest with you. [=85] we haven't had a
meeting yet about it, so, I don't want to be presumptuous, but you know I
think any good acceptance speech gives you a real good sense of the guy
who's asking to be President of the United States.

COURIC: At this point you can right in his voice pretty well.

SALTER: I can, I can, very hard to get his voice out of my head after 20
years.

COURIC: But they want his voice to heard. The campaign complains he's not
being covered enough, and when it is there's too much focus on staff
shakeups and potential conflicts of interest. How many lobbyists work here?

DAVIS: We don't make it a litmus test for employment at the McCain campaign=
.
It goes without saying that some people who are involved in the lobbying
profession do it because they are interested in that side of the equation.
They're interested in government, they're interested in Congress, they're
interested in public service.

COURIC: So lobbyists equals public servants?

DAVIS: Well, I didn't say that. How do you distinguish someone who lobbies
on behalf of cancer from someone who lobbies on behalf of an oil interest. =
I
wouldn't call them the same thing but they're still lobbyists.

COURIC: Campaigns, warts and all, are watched and dissected more than ever
before. And the McCain team is doing its best to adapt to this increasingly
complicated battlefield of modern political warfare.

DAVIS: Campaigns used to be mysteries, nobody ever saw the inside of a
campaign, usually it's a bunch of old guys sitting around with cigars, you
know, dreaming up things to do. And now it's like we're all on all the time=
.

Highlight #2
*Club for Growth Asks McCain to Clarify His Stance on Taxes *(CNN 07/29/08
5:24pm)
WOLF BLITZER: Meanwhile, John McCain has been drawing some harsh criticism
from conservatives over his plans for social security and a fresh hint, jus=
t
a hint right now, that he possibly would either consider raising taxes in
order to help save social security as they say. [=85] It's generated some
unusual criticism from the=97for the republican candidate from some
conservatives out there, hasn't it Mary?

MARY SNOW: It has, Wolf, because Senator McCain is drawing fire from one
group that supports his economic proposals over rival Barack Obama. The
anti-tax group says McCain is sending a mixed message and needs to not blur
any lines.

High on John McCain's to-do list should the republican presidential hopeful
be elected, fix social security.

JOHN MCCAIN: You sit down with the democrats and say, look, let's fix socia=
l
security. We cannot mortgage our children's future.

SNOW: But exactly how McCain plans to save the system is gaining scrutiny.
In an interview with ABC's *This Week* he left open the possibility that he
may raise payroll taxes for social security.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOLOUS: So that means payroll tax increases are on the table
as well?

MCCAIN: There is nothing that's off the table. I have my positions and I'll
articulate them, but nothing is off the table.

SNOW: That statement drew fire from the conservative fiscal group, The Club
for Growth. It wrote a letter to McCain, saying it's shocking as McCain has
been vocal about not raising taxes.

MCCAIN: The choice in this election is stark and simple. Senator Obama will
raise your taxes. I won't.

ANDREW ROTH: *John McCain is trying to have his cake and eat it, too.* He's
trying to appeal to both conservatives, saying that he will be against tax
hikes, and then he's trying to appeal to independents saying that he'll wor=
k
with democrats in order to reform social security. *He needs to get off the
fence and pick a side, basically.*

SNOW: We asked an economic adviser for McCain to clarify, is there a
contradiction between saying he doesn't want to raise taxes but saying he'l=
l
leave open the possibility for higher payroll taxes for social security?

KEVIN HASSETT: I know that he doesn't want to increase taxes. He thinks
social security can be fixed without raising tax rates and he also wants to
sit down at the table and negotiate in good faith with democrats. *So=97so =
I
don't see how those are inconsistent at all.*

SNOW: But *adding to the confusion, the McCain campaign spokesman earlier
today said in an interview, quote, there is no imaginable circumstance wher=
e
John McCain would raise payroll taxes, adding it's absolutely out of the
question. Separately today in Sparks, Nevada, McCain was asked by a young
girl if he would raise taxes if elected. He said flat-out, 'No.'*

*McCain's Maverick Persona and Shifty Tax Stance* (CNN 07/29/08 7:34pm)
SHEPARD SMITH: [...] he served as a lawmaker since the early 80s. He's
running against a man who has been there less than four years. *Today,
[chuckling] John McCain apparently trying to cast himself as a Washington
outsider. The republican presidential nominee appeared in the swing state o=
f
Nevada today, predicting he will take it in November, but what really caugh=
t
our attention was his opening statement at a town-hall meeting in the
community of Sparks; a statement in which he embraced the description
bestowed upon him by supporters and opponents alike.*

JOHN MCCAIN: I have been called a "maverick," somebody who marches to the
beat of his own drum. What it really means is I understand who I work for. =
I
don't work a party. I do not work for a president. I do not work for a
special interest. I do not work for myself. I work for you, for the country
that has been the love of my life. I work for you.

SMITH: He also worked to avoid a small controversy he may have stirred up
over the weekend when he suggested a tax increase may be the table. James
Rosen in Washington, how did all of that get started?

JAMES ROSEN: [...] It started earlier this month when Senator McCain said n=
o
solution for shoring up the social security trust fund was 'off the table.'
Anti-tax conservatives nearly rioted, so it fell to campaign spokesman,
Tucker Bounds to appear this morning in "America's Newsroom" where our own
Megyn Kelly, fatigued by what she called Bounds' waffling, finally pinned
him down about Senator McCain's intentions.

MEGYN KELLY: Is he going to raise the payroll tax? Might the social securit=
y
tax go up? Is that on the table?

TUCKER BOUNDS: No [...]. There is no imaginable circumstance where John
McCain would raise payroll taxes. *It's absolutely out of the question.*

ROSEN: "Out of the question." Later, in Sparks, Nevada a little girl asked
McCain if he would 'raise our taxes,' and he said simply, 'No,' Shep.

SMITH: McCain also had some new criticism of his democratic rival on the
very issue of raising taxes.

ROSEN: Senator McCain claimed today, "Pretty much anything that you can tax=
,
Obama wants to tax it more." McCain claimed that Obama has sought nearly $1
billion in pork barrel spending, roughly $1 million for every working day
Obama has been in the senate. The Obama campaign responded by noting that
McCain's own Montana state chairman sought $3 million to study bear DNA.

SMITH: Bear DNA?

*Is McCain's Flip-Flop on Taxes the Result of His Party Pinning Him To
Unrealistic Positions?* (MSNBC 07/29/08 5:57pm)
MIKE BARNACLE: Pat Toomey, the President of the Club for Growth, wrote an
open letter to McCain after that statement. Reading, "*This statement was
particularly shocking because you have been adamant in your opposition to
raising taxes under any circumstances. Your comments yesterday send America=
n
taxpayers and businesses a mixed message about where you stand on this
issue. We hope you will clarify where you stand on this important issue and
reaffirm your commitment to eschew all tax increases."*  Can any sane
politician make an adamant, set in stone statement given the fact that we'r=
e
a country at war, with an energy crisis, about never raising any tax under
any circumstances?

CHRYSTIA FREELAND: Well I think it would be extremely imprudent. And I woul=
d
add to your point about war and energy, the fact that the American
government is in the red. This is a very, very dire economic situation that
the United States is facing right now, and we see more bills coming in ever=
y
day. We've had Fannie and Freddie, we don't know how many regional banks th=
e
government is going to end up bailing out. Remember the savings and loans
crisis. *So I think John McCain, perhaps, made the mistake of political
candor in saying he can't take anything off the table. That is absolutely
true.* And we should also remember, that the first President Bush did not
fair very well when he made that absolutely firm, clear campaign pledge not
to raise taxes. *So, I think that in a way, the biggest problem John McCain
is facing in this campaign is the hard right in his own party which is
trying to pin him into positions that are not really very realistic right
now.*

BARNACLE: [=85] Does he [Obama] do the old fashioned thing and go at John
McCain, you know, flip-flopping on taxes? Or does he just let the Republica=
n
Party, you know, discombobulate itself?

DEL WALTERS: Well I think what you're going to see, is you're going to see
the Republican right in meltdown mode over this. Because it's one thing to
be impeached by the words of your opponent in a primary, in this case
Hillary Clinton versus Barack Obama. *It's another thing to be impeached by
your own words, and how many times have we heard John McCain saying that gu=
y
is going to raise your taxes, I won't. Well now, all they have to do is pla=
y
that clip which you just played where they hear John McCain saying one thin=
g
and then turning around and saying another thing.* And I think this is the
worst type of flip-flop because, you know to go back to the last election,
it's the economy. And that's the one thing everybody's going to be talking
about is how do I fill up my gas tank and how do I keep a roof up over the
top of my head?

BARNACLE: I kept hearing the John McCain of 2000, when I heard just that
clip, the real John McCain. What did you hear?

RICHARD COHEN: *Yeah, I had the same feeling that every once in a while Joh=
n
McCain just can't contain himself and he says the truth. This is the truth.
*The United States has something like 37 trillion dollars in unfunded
Medicaid options. I mean, we have got to do something here, the Club for
Growth is the Club for Growth of deficits. Either we're going to raise taxe=
s
or we're going to lower entitlements or something. But something's got to b=
e
done and McCain is facing that.

*Does McCain Not Speak For His Campaign or Does The Campaign Not Speak For
McCain?* (MSNBC 07/29/08 8:08pm)
KEITH OLBERMANN: Now back to Senator McCain and the taxes. And today he
ignored the advice of W.C. Fields, never work with animals or children, at =
a
Nevada townhall this morning, deflecting criticism that he had flip-flopped
on his pledge to not raise taxes. [=85]

LITTLE GIRL: If you were President, would you raise our taxes?

MCCAIN: No.

OLBERMANN: But when Senator McCain spoke with reporters on his campaign bus
earlier this month, on the ninth of this month, he did not rule out a tax
increase for funding social security. Over the weekend, in an interview wit=
h
George Stephanopoulos, he returned to the idea of a payroll tax increase to
buttress social security.

[McCain/ Stephanopoulos Interview Clip Shown]

OLBERMANN: Moving back even further, having been a reversal from this
stance, Senator McCain outlined in an interview with the National Review
Magazine in March of last year the question was, "If you get the Democrats
to agree, or at least to come to the table on entitlements or on tax
simplification, are those circumstances under which you'd be willing to
accept a tax increase?" Senator McCain, "No; No." Question, "No
circumstances?" Senator McCain: "No. None. None." [=85] *He won't raise tax=
es
but everything including the payroll tax increase is on the table for socia=
l
security reform. Is this a flip-flop or is this a flip-flop-flip?*

JOHN HARWOOD: I'd prefer the simple flip-flop. Just like for Barack Obama,
the calendar has turned, he's not in the phase of the primary campaign when
he was trying to impress conservatives, the base of his party. He's got to
now try to make a different argument against Barack Obama, somebody who's
also trying to reach across the aisle, appeal to independents, and that's
what he's doing here. But it's problematic as those quotes you just played
indicated.

OLBERMANN: Senator McCain's spokesman, Tucker Bounds, told Fox News this
morning that the Senator had not really been speaking for the campaign when
he told Stephanopoulos that a tax increase was on the table. I'm reluctant
to close this competition out for this race, but that's the damnedest thing
I've heard yet. How is that possible? That the candidate is not speaking fo=
r
his own campaign?

HARWOOD: Actually Keith, it's not possible. I don't know what Tucker is
talking about. It is, however, possible that the campaign does not speak fo=
r
John McCain. This is the challenge for John McCain and for all the people
working for him. This is a free-wielding candidate, more so than almost
anybody we've seen run for a national office. He's going to do what he want=
s
to do, they all know it, and they got to brace themselves because sometimes
they get these unexpected moments. I am sure his campaign was not
anticipating that response to George Stephanopoulos.

OLBERMANN: But if that is actually going to be a response at any point from
a campaign, is that have catastrophe written all over it? Or am I not being
sufficiently suspicious of this? Is this just going to buttress the idea
that he's the so-called Maverick on everything?

HARWOOD: Well he's trying to do the straight talk express, and he's trying
to preserve a little nuance, as you saw in that answer to George. What he's
saying is my position is on against a tax increase, but as a bi-partisan,
somebody who's willing to engage in conversation with the other side, I'm
not willing to take it off the table. The problem, of course, is that quote
you showed from the National Review, showed he was quite definitive in
taking it off the table when he was running for the Republican nomination.

[=85] John McCain's got so many problems in this campaign, he's got a
conservative base that doesn't trust him, hence they rush out a statement
like that much stronger than what you heard from liberals about Barack Obam=
a
when he shifted, say, on terrorist surveillance on that FISA bill or even o=
n
Campaign Finance Reform. John McCain is distrusted by his base, he's trying
to reach out to the middle. Barack Obama has the advantage going into the
general election of a base that's solidly behind him and giving him a lot o=
f
running room to do what he wants.

TIE COURIC: [=85] There&#39;s the presidential candidate with a
message that&#39;s defined, defended, and disseminated daily by an army of =
about
400 at the McCain headquarters in Arlington, VA. This campaign is led by no=
t
one, but two generals. The first, an operative skilled in tactics and
mechanics, honed as campaign manager for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steve Schmi=
dt.<br>&nbsp;<br>STEVE SCHMIDT: I work to run the day-to-day operations of
the campaign and involved in the strategy, talking to Senator McCain. Help
directing the activities here, you know, at the campaign headquarters and o=
ut
across the nation to help deliver the Senator&#39;s message.<br>&nbsp;<br>C=
OURIC: The campaign&#39;s other commanding officer, Rick Davis,
is a longtime ally. He&#39;s fought many political battles alongside McCain=
,
including his presidential run in 2000.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why do you think you&#=
39;ve lasted so long?<br>&nbsp;<br>RICK DAVIS: I don&#39;t know, I just kee=
p showing up. You know,
nobody tells me to leave so at 7 o&#39;clock in the morning I&#39;m here an=
d trying to
do what I can to try to help the campaign.<br>&nbsp;<br>COURIC: Is it a pro=
blem to not have a single person who&#39;s in
charge of the entire operation?<br>&nbsp;<br>DAVIS: You know, if you dial i=
t back a couple of weeks, I was
doing all of it. I went to McCain and said, look, I need help.<br>&nbsp;<br=
>COURIC: The war room and its lieutenants are on defense.
Charged with monitoring the non-stop media coverage with plenty of sugar an=
d
caffeine at the ready.<span>&nbsp; </span>[=85] The
communications team plays offense, making sure the candidate&#39;s message =
is
relayed and repeated.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this modern media age the points and =
counterpoints come
fast and furious, through every conceivable outlet. The campaign also tries=
 to
reach out to all kinds of voting blocks, including women, Hispanics, and
African Americans. The efforts are coordinated by Aaron Minaigo.<span>&nbsp=
;</span><br>&nbsp;<br>You are an African American man supporting John McCai=
n,
obviously, do your friends give you a hard time at all?<br>&nbsp;<br>AARON =
MINAIGO: No, absolutely. Most of my friends, they like
John McCain. In any other election year, they&#39;d probably be right here =
working
with us.<br>&nbsp;<br>COURIC: A regiment of advanced personnel choreographs=
 every
detail of every trip and appearance. [=85]<br>&nbsp;<br><span style=3D"font=

hot dog stand today?</span><br>&nbsp;<br>CARLA EUDY: Well, no. The guy on t=
he ground sent a photo and
was like this is the perfect place.<br>&nbsp;<br>COURIC: Another challenge =
for the advance team,
orchestrating the events that McCain has made his trademark, town hall
meetings. The communications team back at headquarters and traveling with t=
he
candidate constantly looks for ways to refine and strengthen his message. [=
=85]
But the mother of all appearances will be in Minneanapolis in September. Wh=
en
McCain accepts his party&#39;s nomination. And the pressure is on Mark Salt=
er. He&#39;s
co-written five books with the Senator, and on this day he&#39;s heading to=
 Maine
to work on, perhaps, the biggest speech of his life.<br>Do you have any ide=
as?<br>&nbsp;<br>MARK SALTER: No, not a one, to be honest with you. [=85] w=
e
haven&#39;t had a meeting yet about it, so, I don&#39;t want to be presumpt=
uous, but
you know I think any good acceptance speech gives you a real good sense of =
the
guy who&#39;s asking to be President of the United States.<br>&nbsp;<br>COU=
RIC: At this point you can right in his voice pretty
well.<br>&nbsp;<br>SALTER: I can, I can, very hard to get his voice out of =
my
head after 20 years.<br><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br=
><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">COURIC: But they want
his voice to heard. The campaign complains he&#39;s not being covered enoug=
h, and
when it is there&#39;s too much focus on staff shakeups and potential confl=
icts of
interest. How many lobbyists work here?</span><br><span style=3D"font-weigh=
t: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">DAVIS: We don=
&#39;t make
it a litmus test for employment at the McCain campaign. It goes without say=
ing
that some people who are involved in the lobbying profession do it because =
they
are interested in that side of the equation. They&#39;re interested in gove=
rnment,
they&#39;re interested in Congress, they&#39;re interested in public servic=
e.</span><br><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br><span styl=

equals public servants?</span><br><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;=
</span><br><span style=3D"font-weight: bold;">DAVIS: Well, I didn&#39;t
say that. How do you distinguish someone who lobbies on behalf of cancer fr=
om
someone who lobbies on behalf of an oil interest. I wouldn&#39;t call them =
the same
thing but they&#39;re still lobbyists.</span><br>&nbsp;<br>COURIC: Campaign=
s, warts and all, are watched and dissected
more than ever before. And the McCain team is doing its best to adapt to th=

increasingly complicated battlefield of modern political warfare.<br>&nbsp;=

to save the system is gaining scrutiny. In an interview with ABC&#39;s <i>T=

that he may raise payroll taxes for social security.<br>&nbsp;<br>GEORGE ST=
EPHANOPOLOUS: So that
means payroll tax increases are on the table as well?<br>&nbsp;<br>MCCAIN: =
There is nothing that&#39;s
off the table. I have my positions and I&#39;ll articulate them, but nothin=

the table.<br>&nbsp;<br>SNOW: That statement drew fire
from the conservative fiscal group, The Club for Growth. It wrote a letter =
to
McCain, saying it&#39;s shocking as McCain has been vocal about not raising=
 taxes.<br>&nbsp;<br>MCCAIN: The choice in this
election is stark and simple. Senator Obama will raise your taxes. I won&#3=

to appeal to both conservatives, saying that he will be against tax hikes, =

 adviser
for McCain to clarify, is there a contradiction between saying he doesn&#39=

to raise taxes but saying he&#39;ll leave open the possibility for higher p=
ayroll
taxes for social security?<br>&nbsp;<br>KEVIN HASSETT: I know that he doesn=

tax rates and he also wants to sit down at the table and negotiate in good =

t Toomey, the President of the Club for
Growth, wrote an open letter to McCain after that statement. Reading, &quot=
;<b>This statement was particularly shocking
because you have been adamant in your opposition to raising taxes under any
circumstances. Your comments yesterday send American taxpayers and business=
es a
mixed message about where you stand on this issue. We hope you will clarify
where you stand on this important issue and reaffirm your commitment to esc=

all tax increases.&quot;</b><span>&nbsp; </span>Can any
sane politician make an adamant, set in stone statement given the fact that
we&#39;re a country at war, with an energy crisis, about never raising any =
tax
under any circumstances?<br>&nbsp;<br>CHRYSTIA FREELAND: Well I think it wo=
uld be extremely
imprudent. And I would add to your point about war and energy, the fact tha=
t
the American government is in the red. This is a very, very dire economic
situation that the United States is facing right now, and we see more bills
coming in every day. We&#39;ve had Fannie and Freddie, we don&#39;t know ho=
w many
regional banks the government is going to end up bailing out. Remember the
savings and loans crisis. <b>So I think
John McCain, perhaps, made the mistake of political candor in saying he can=
&#39;t
take anything off the table. That is absolutely true.</b> And we should als=
o
remember, that the first President Bush did not fair very well when he made
that absolutely firm, clear campaign pledge not to raise taxes. <b>So, I th=
ink that in a way, the biggest
problem John McCain is facing in this campaign is the hard right in his own
party which is trying to pin him into positions that are not really very

you&#39;re going to see the Republican right in meltdown mode over this. Be=
cause
it&#39;s one thing to be impeached by the words of your opponent in a prima=
ry, in
this case Hillary Clinton versus Barack Obama. <b>It&#39;s another thing to=
 be impeached by your own words, and how many
times have we heard John McCain saying that guy is going to raise your taxe=
s, I
won&#39;t. Well now, all they have to do is play that clip which you just p=
layed
where they hear John McCain saying one thing and then turning around and sa=
ying
another thing.</b> And I think this is the worst type of flip-flop because,=
 you
know to go back to the last election, it&#39;s the economy. And that&#39;s =
the one
thing everybody&#39;s going to be talking about is how do I fill up my gas =
tank and
how do I keep a roof up over the top of my head?<br>&nbsp;<br>BARNACLE: I k=

I had the same feeling that every once in a while John McCain just can&#39;=
