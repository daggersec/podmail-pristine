.... I sent the attached note to John, at both the transition and CAP, but =
it bounced back from the transition, and I got an "on leave" message from C=
AP.  Would you be able to make sure that it reaches him? =20

Many thanks---have a great Holiday
Ira=20

John:

Knowing how busy you are, I haven't reached out to you about my interest in=
 serving in the Administration.  (I've spoken to Christine, and made some o=
ther contacts).  However, it occurred to me today that I wouldn't want to b=
e the only old friend in Washington who didn't contact you!
This could be misconstrued as lack of interest, or even insulting ("we've k=
nown eachother 25 years. Why wouldn't he call me?")

I hope you won't be surprised to know that I would love to join the Adminis=
tration if an appropriate position were there. I think that Senator Obama's=
 election is the greatest thing that has happened in our country in our lif=
etimes.  Moreover, for those of us who have dedicated ourselves to policy, =
progressive government, and public service, this is a moment of great oppor=
tunity, enormous challenge, and national crisis that comes along about once=
 a century. =20

You, Rahm and the President-elect have a wealth of talent to choose from.  =
I hope that you will consider whether my record as an adviser, negotiator, =
diplomat, consensus builder and team player makes me someone who could  con=
tribute.  I would welcome the chance to talk with you about where I might f=
it.

Best regards,
Ira


(Congratulations on a superb transition thus far!)
