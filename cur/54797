More in-fighting among conservatives...

Rep. Thaddeus McCotter: Ideologues like Sen. Jim DeMint are 'nuts.'<http://=
thinkprogress.org/2009/10/05/mccotter-demint-nuts/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/05/mccotter-demint-nuts/

On Saturday, Rep. Thaddeus McCotter<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/01/15/mcc=
otter-schip/> (R-MI) discussed the direction of the GOP in an address to th=
e Republican Northeast Conference in Newport, RI. McCotter<http://thinkprog=
ress.org/2009/05/04/mccotter-insurgency/>, who serves as the chairman of th=
e Republican Policy Committee in the House, chided conservative "ideologues=
" for controlling the party. McCotter explained that these individuals want=
 to "purge" opponents "all the time...because they're nuts." He then clarif=
ied that his remarks were directed at radical conservatives like Sen. Jim D=
eMint (R-SC):

MCCOTTER: If the Republican Party wants to become its own antithesis, which=
 is an ideological party, we're going to continue to have these problems. R=
emember, ideologues, there's a reason why they purge all the time - it's be=
cause they're nuts. Hope the ideologues weren't listening. If, however, as =
I said before, we understand that we represent constituencies and America i=
s a vast country full of a variety of opinions and peoples, way of life, th=
en we will get where we need to go. As for the attitude of the Senator from=
 South Carolina that it is better to have fewer friends than more, that's e=
asier to say in South Carolina than Detroit.

Watch it:

Before Sen. Arlen Specter (D-PA) left the Republican Party, DeMint told a b=
logger that Specter "cut our knees from under us" and informed Specter pers=
onally<http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/05/demint-told-specter-hed-s=
upport-toomey-shortly-before-specter-switched.php> that he would be support=
ing his far-right primary opponent. DeMint also told the same right-wing bl=
ogger that conservatives in the Senate need to aggressively "go after<http:=
//thinkprogress.org/2009/04/28/radical-right-drives-out-specter/>" other GO=
P moderates Maine Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe.
