e heard from a larger platform, I'm asking you to consider contributing=
 to his campaign for Congress=2E=C2=A0

With just under 8 days left until this quarter closes, donating today i=
s more important than ever!

Help my Dad spread the values of working class families in Congress by =
donating $25, $50, $500, or $1,000 today=2E
