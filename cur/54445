Here's a stab at an answer on why she's going to Flint.

*Why are you going to Flint on Sunday?*

   - The situation in Flint is an emergency.  For nearly two years, a lot
   of poor children were drinking poisoned water because their governor wan=
ted
   to save a buck -- as if their lives weren=E2=80=99t worth even that much=
.
   - Every day that goes by without proper testing and care, children are
   at risk. And I know from work I've done over many years on behalf of
   children and environmental justice that toxic lead can have terrible
   effects on kids.
   - So I am going to Flint at the mayor=E2=80=99s invitation on Sunday to =
get an
   in-depth briefing about what is happening and how we can help.  We have =
to
   fix the pipes and we need to immediately get families the health care an=
d
   support they need. The federal government is going to have to step up.  =
I
   know Senator Stabenow is leading the fight to get $200 million to fix
   Flint=E2=80=99s water infrastructure. Congress should do that immediatel=
y.
   - Let=E2=80=99s not forget, repairing trust takes longer than repairing =
pipes.
   We have to hold the governor and others accountable.  And as a country, =
we
   need to take a hard look at all the other Flints out there, all the plac=
es
   where poor communities and communities of color are exposed to
   environmental danger, government neglect, and corporate abuse.
   - A lot of these problems don=E2=80=99t get the attention they deserve o=
n the
   campaign trail, but they=E2=80=99re at the heart of what we need to do t=
ogether as
   a country.  We have to break down *all* the barriers holding Americans
   back and take all forms of inequality, including systemic racism and
   sexism.  Slogans aren=E2=80=99t going to solve this.  We all need to do =
our part,
   and we need real solutions that can actually make a difference in people=
=E2=80=99s
   lives.
