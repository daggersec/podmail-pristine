We dropping this idea? Didn't hear back

Chief,

Thank you again for doing this, means more to me than you know.

Had a hard time writing this as you can imagine. I spent hours in front of =
a blank screen so I had some help from my teneo folks
Tried to tone it down but will let you have a look

Best,

Doug



Dear...,

Last week, I was in New York for the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) and I =
saw a friend who, without his ingenuity and help, CGI would never have exis=
ted.  Some of you know Doug Band personally, some of you have heard about h=
im for years.  For those of you who only know about him from the press cove=
rage he received last week, it only felt right to take the time to help set=
 the record straight and talk about Doug from the perspective of someone wh=
o knows him well, especially since Doug is a private person who would never=
 do this himself.





I first met Doug when he was a young man working in the White House, all of=
 22 years old and fresh out of college. Since that moment, Doug has spent a=
 lifetime serving President Clinton and advancing his causes and beliefs. D=
oug was then as he is today =96 smart, loyal and driven to make a differenc=
e in the world.

The White House is full of ambitious people: everyone knows that.  But even=
 in the building that houses some of the people who literally run the world=
, Doug outworked everyone around him (which is how he then became the young=
est deputy assistant to the President), .  And on top of this, he got his M=
asters and JD from Georgetown at night =96 in fact, he was my student there=
, a full five years after I first met him.

After President Clinton=92s term ended, the Clinton family asked Doug to st=
ay and work in the post-presidency. Doug turned down a lucrative job at Gol=
dman Sachs to help the President transition into private life, even in the =
midst of a difficult time when President Clinton=92s approval rating was lo=
wer than it had ever been, and many had left the President=92s side for gre=
ener pastures. The decision Doug made to stick with the President was made =
out of loyalty, and I always admired that.

But in a very short period of time, and at an astonishingly young age, Doug=
 not only helped build and guide the Clinton Foundation, he also traveled t=
he world with the President , came up with the idea for the Clinton Global =
Initiative, and worked to turn it into an entity that has helped literally =
hundreds of millions of people across the globe.



And Doug=92s work isn=92t limited to CGI. When President Obama asked Presid=
ent Clinton to go to North Korea in 2009 to free two journalists that had b=
een imprisoned, Doug was the critical piece in making the trip happen and l=
eading negotiations. It was Doug that helped organize the relief efforts fo=
r several global disasters including the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, 2004 Indi=
an Ocean tsunami and 2005=92s Hurricane Katrina.  And Doug did all of this =
while also being someone who has spent most of the past dozen years saying =
no=94 =96 an unenviable task for every close Presidential advisor who has t=
o act in the best interest of the President. As someone who has also held t=
his kind of a role, I know full well that it is a difficult position to be =
in.

That=92s why CEOs, world leaders leaving office, philanthropists and academ=
ics from all of the world seek Doug=92s advice and help: he has a truly glo=
bal perspective, he knows how to make things happen, and he works harder th=
an anyone else. Those are good qualities to have.



And that=92s why people are drawn to him.  It=92s why he teaches at NYU, is=
 on the board of Georgetown University, serves on an array of committees an=
d boards for a wide variety of causes, and takes hundreds of meetings each =
year with young men and women who come to him looking for life and career a=
dvice. For those of you that know Doug, can you ever recall him turning dow=
n the chance to help out a young person? How many people do you know that c=
an credit Doug with helping them find their job, decide where to attend sch=
ool or grow professionally? I can tell you it=92s a long list of people.

Now, in this next chapter in Doug=92s life =96 and still at an incredibly y=
oung age =96 he has created and built a new organization, Teneo, an advisor=
y business that in just two years has over 200 employees in 11 countries. T=
eneo has hired top level talent from both sides of the aisle, from every ma=
jor institution, government agency, and industry.  And while many of you pr=
obably saw President Clinton=92s incredibly supportive and positive comment=
s about Doug on CBS This Morning, Teneo=92s work has extremely little to do=
 with President Clinton, if anything.  Doug doesn=92t need to build a firm =
on the back of anyone: anyone who knows him knows that his own talents are =
more than enough.





I don=92t often write emails like this, but sometimes when you see a wrong,=
 you feel compelled to right it.  That=92s the case here, and even though D=
oug will probably hate everything I just wrote, someone needed to set the r=
ecord straight, and I=92m glad I had the chance to do it.
