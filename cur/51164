Dear Mr. Podesta,

My name is Olivia Paschal, and I serve as the Events Coordinator for the
Yale College Democrats. I am writing to invite you to speak at a special
meeting that we are excited to be cosponsoring with The Politic, Yale=E2=80=
=99s
undergraduate journal of politics.

The Yale College Democrats is the largest activist organization at Yale,
and we participate in elections work such as canvassing, voter
registration, and phone banking, as well as legislative advocacy work at
the state, local, and national levels. Additionally, each week we bring in
speakers to help our group and the greater Yale community better understand
the political process and American political culture. Previous speakers at
an event like this have included Gov. Howard Dean, Representatives James
Clyburn and Barney Frank, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Huffington Post=E2=80=
=99s
Arianna Huffington, and Planned Parenthood=E2=80=99s Cecile Richards.

The Politic, Yale=E2=80=99s only undergraduate political publication, has b=
een
reporting on domestic and international affairs since 1947.  Previous
Editors-in-Chief include Fareed Zakaria, Gideon Rose and Robert Kagan. The
magazine prides itself in speaking with this country's=E2=80=94and the
world's=E2=80=94foremost public servants, policy makers, and intellectuals.=
 The
Politic has also been proud to host these figures in conversation with the
Yale community. Recent guests have included the Reverend Al Sharpton and
NASA Administrator Charles Bolden.

We would love to host you on campus during a Monday evening this semester
to discuss your time in the Clinton and Obama administrations, as well as
the 2016 presidential campaign. However, if your schedule does not allow
for a Monday night, we would be happy to work out another day. Would you be
available February 16, March 2, or any Monday March 23 - April 21?

Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions about this
invitation.

Sincerely,

Olivia Paschal
