Hello John - Hope all is well and that life is not getting too silly in the m=
idst of the issues du jour.=20

I am currently negotiating an offer from a cancer genomics start up based in=
 San Francisco. This is a shift from my current work but I am very excited b=
y the opportunity - in many ways the place feels a lot like CAP in the early=
 days. I will initially run partnerships and then after we come out of "stea=
lth mode," do broader communications.=20

I'd be grateful if you are willing to give me a reference and perhaps highli=
ght my capacity for relationship development and management?

The CEO is a dynamic guy named Will Polkinghorn. He's an oncologist previous=
ly with Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York before migrating to San Francis=
co. The firm has a relationship with UCSF and the state of California and it=
 is my belief that it will become an great case study of public private part=
nerships between novel, cutting edge patient care and public institutions.=20=


Please let me know if you'd like further background from me and I'll get it t=
o you.=20

Thank you for this and hope to see you soon!
Anna
