Dear LCV Member,

I am writing to you with an urgent plea to help  Representative Jay
Inslee in his race to become the next Governor of Washington  state. I
am forwarding you an invitation for a reception in Washington, DC  on
October 4th to support Inslee's campaign. We hope  you will use this
opportunity to make a generous contribution. You can make  a
contribution directly to the campaign online by clicking here or
completing the information on the invitation below and mailing it with
a  check to the campaign: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DRnpP3oFYort6QDfr=
X3xbrQ

As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Inslee earned an
impressive  92% lifetime score from LCV. He has made the clean energy
economy his number  one issue both in office and on the campaign
trail.

Last fall, LCV took the extraordinary move to endorse Jay in our first
endorsement for a governor in over 30 years. But we're not the only
ones who  know how important this race is. The Democratic and
Republican Governors  Associations and observers around the country
have listed this at the top of  their target lists. Needless to say
this means a big fight is ahead of us.

While Washington state is a decidedly blue state (a Republican has not
won the office since 1980) this is a wide open contest and Jay needs
all the  help he can get. His opponent Rob McKenna is no friend of the
environment  voting many times against the environmental community
agenda when he served on  the King County Council. His term as
Attorney General has been no better and  was recently ordered by the
state Supreme Court to put politics aside and  defend laws in support
of public lands.

The very best way you can help Inslee, right now, in his  effort to
become the greenest governor in the nation, is to help  financially.
Click here to contribute directly to Jay's campaign online or complete
the information on  the attached invitation and mail it along with a
check to the campaign: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DOZgTyFZQ2kdTlvQJlQZ=
LXg

Thank you in advance for your generosity.

-Gene
