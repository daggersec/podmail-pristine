John,

        I hope all's well with you and that you'll be able to take at least
a day or two over the holidays to decompress.  Just FYI, we had a
successful event in NW Indiana last week on Hillary's behalf.  Met the
financial goals and all the right people were there.  Think the former
president enjoyed it.  Also, Dan and I are working to ensure that our
delegation will be entirely supportive.  You can focus on the other 49
states; no need to worry about ours.

All the best,

Evan
