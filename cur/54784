We need you to act in the next 48 hours: Tell your senators to vote against the dirty Keystone XL pipeline, cuts in clean energy, and attacks on EPA climate protections: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=wXb-1-YeucS3EApL02kWQQ .

John,

Your senators may vote on terrible anti-environmental riders in the next 48 hours. We need you to call them now to make sure they vote for a budget that ends Big Oil handouts and protects our air, land, and water!  Call your Senators: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=a7BRLfvKqsbLBSAdwXTobw .

In the next 48 hours, your senators will likely vote on amendments to the budget that would approve the dirty Keystone XL tar sands pipeline, slash investments in clean energy, weaken EPA clean air protections, and open public lands like the Arctic Refuge to drilling.

If anti-environmental legislators have their way, they could wreak havoc on our bedrock environmental and public health protections. Don't let them win.

Make your voice heard now: Tell your senators to pass a clean budget by rejecting all anti-environmental amendments: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=DZ8SmkB-Vb8mrfamk_BFHg .

To be clear, the original budget bill proposed by Senator Patty Murray is a good piece of legislation that funds the EPA's vital mission of protecting our air and water, while also investing in clean energy.

But unless you take action now, Big Oil-backed legislators could turn this bill into an anti-environmental wreck when it comes to the Senate floor.

Here's how it works: Once the budget bill goes to the Senate floor, senators can offer amendments to it that must be voted on immediately.

We are expecting votes on amendments that could include:

*  Approving the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and drilling projects on our public lands;
*  Eliminating EPA protections against carbon, mercury, soot, and other toxic pollution that endangers our families' health and is fueling climate change;
*  Cutting support for clean energy projects and research; and
*  Protecting billions in handouts for oil companies that already make obscene profits.

Basically, Big Oil and Dirty Coal's congressional cronies will try to roll some of the worst anti-environmental legislation into this budget bill by holding quick votes back-to-back with little time for us to weigh in. That's why we need you to talk to your senators today, so that when they are called on to vote this week, they will stand up against all these bad amendments.

Will you call your senators now to demand a clean budget that cuts Big Oil handouts, not the environmental protections we all depend on? Use our easy call tool here: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=xhsW15ueHpZKbXGLIjEUpA .

With very little time before the votes take place, we need to get the Senate's attention immediately. And the best way to do that is to get their phones ringing off the hooks.

We've made it as easy as possible for you to call and have provided you with all the talking points you'll need. Take a moment to help us win this fight now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=p4b3g6KSUmUy22rIT9BV4g .

Thanks so much for taking action today. We'll keep you updated as this fight over the Senate budget and amendments progresses.

Best,
