GIBSON:  Governor, let me start by asking you a question that I asked John
McCain about you, and it is really the central question.

      Can you look the country in the eye and say "I have the experience and
I have the ability to be not just vice president, but perhaps president of
the United States of America?"

      PALIN:  I do, Charlie, and on January 20, when John McCain and I are
sworn in, if we are so privileged to be elected to serve this country,
we'llbe ready.  I'm ready.

      GIBSON:  And you didn't say to yourself, "Am I experienced enough?  Am
I ready?  Do I know enough about international affairs?  Do I -- will I feel
comfortable enough on the national stage to do this?"



      PALIN:  I didn't hesitate, no.

****************************



      GIBSON:  You said recently, in your old church, "Our national leaders
are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God."   Are we fighting a
holy war?

      PALIN:  You know, I don't know if that was my exact quote.

      GIBSON:  Exact words.

      PALIN:  But the reference there is a repeat of Abraham Lincoln's words
when he said -- first, he suggested never presume to know what God's will
is, and I would never presume to know God's will or to speak God's words.

      But what Abraham Lincoln had said, and that's a repeat in my comments,
was let us not pray that God is on our side in a war or any other time, but
let us pray that we are on God's side.



      That's what that comment was all about, Charlie. //

      GIBSON:  I take your point about Lincoln's words, but you went on and
said, "There is a plan and it is God's plan."

      PALIN:  I believe that there is a plan for this world and that plan
for this world is for good.  I believe that there is great hope and great
potential for every country to be able to live and be protected with
inalienable rights that I believe are God-given, Charlie, and I believe that
those are the rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

      That, in my world view, is a grand -- the grand plan.

      GIBSON:  But then are you sending your son on a task that is from God?

      PALIN:  I don't know if the task is from God, Charlie.  What I know is
that my son has made a decision.  I am so proud of his independent and
strong decision he has made, what he decided to do and serving for the right
reasons and serving something greater than himself and not choosing a real
easy path where he could be more comfortable and certainly safer.





      GIBSON:  (INAUDIBLE -- Didn't that take some hubris?)

      PALIN:  I -- I answered him yes because I have the confidence in that
readiness and knowing that you can't blink, you have to be wired in a way of
being so committed to the mission, the mission that we're on, reform of this
country and victory in the war, you can't blink.

      So I didn't blink then even when asked to run as his running mate.
