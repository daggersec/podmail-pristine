John,

I hear rumblings through the grapevine that you're coming to Little Rock
soon for an event involving the Catletts? I assume you're schedule is
packed but would love to see you if you have time. And of course, if you
need anything while you're here, just let me know.

Hope you're well, and say hello to Mary for me.

Kathy
