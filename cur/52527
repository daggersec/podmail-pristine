Kind of President He Would Be
> =20
>       Mitt Romney=92s refusal to take responsibility for the actions of B=
ain Capital from 1999 to 2002 says a lot about the kind of President he wou=
ld be.
> =20
>       Friday night, Romney persisted in denying that he was responsible f=
or the behavior of Bain during the period, even though he was listed on SEC=
 documents as the firm=92s CEO, Chairman, President and sole stockholder.  =
Romney claims he =93left=94 Bain Capital to run the Olympics back in 1999 a=
nd is not in the least responsible for the actions it took over the next th=
ree years, notwithstanding the fact that he was CEO, Chairman, President an=
d sole stockholder until 2002.
> =20
>       There is mounting evidence of specific decisions and actions that u=
ndercut Romney=92s case that he was no longer involved in the day-to-day de=
cisions of Bain Capital after 1999.
> =20
>      But the central =96 indisputable fact is that the CEO, Chairman, Pre=
sident and sole stockholder of a company is responsible for whatever the co=
mpany does =96 by definition.   For normal people, any argument to the cont=
rary simply defies common sense
> =20
>       Romney can dance around the issue, parse words, argue he gave up =
=93management control=94 until he is blue in the face. But however he struc=
tured the decision making process at Bain Capital while he was also running=
 the Olympics, he was ultimately in charge =96 and he was ultimately respon=
sible for =96 and benefited mightily from its actions.   In every business =
the buck stops with the CEO, Chairman, President and sole stockholder =96 i=
t=92s that simple.
> =20
>       Romney=92s refusal to be held responsible for the actions of the co=
mpany he owned =96 and for which he remained CEO, Chairman and President =
=96 says a lot about the kind of President he would be =96 and a lot more a=
bout his character.
> =20
>       Romney was happy to make millions of dollars from the company he ow=
ned.   He was happy to take credit for the =93jobs he created=94.   But he =
refuses to take responsibility for the lives his company destroyed, or the =
fact that in some cases he loaded up companies with debt and bled them dry =
to pay his own fees before he put them into bankruptcy and fired their empl=
oyees.
> =20
>      Romney cashed Bain=92s checks =96 and sometimes he apparently deposi=
ted them in Swiss Bank accounts =96 or accounts in Bermuda or the Cayman Is=
lands.  But he refuses to take responsibility for the fact that the firm wa=
s =96 as the Washington Post called it =96 a =93pioneer of outsourcing=94.
> =20
>       This is a guy who plays by a different set of rules than ordinary m=
ortals. And the last thing he wants to do is allow those ordinary mortals t=
o see first hand how he did what he did by disclosing his income tax return=
s from the years he was active at Bain.
> =20
>       Some of the companies he acquired at Bain did well.  Others went un=
der.  But win or lose, Romney always made money.   Workers may have lost th=
eir livelihoods and pensions.  Small businesses that served as suppliers to=
 his companies may have gone under.  But Romney always came out ahead.
> =20
>       Mitt Romney is the kind of guy who is always happy to bask in the g=
low of success, but is never willing to take responsibility for failure. =
=20
> =20
>      This entire episode is reminiscing of Romney=92s reaction to the rev=
elation that as an 18 year old student at the Cranbrook Prep School, he was=
 involved in bullying John Lauber, a fellow student who he didn=92t believe=
 =93fit in=94.  The Washington Post reported that a fellow student named Ma=
thew Freidman, and three other former students, reported that Romney had ma=
rched:
> =20
>      =93=85out of his own room ahead of a prep school posse shouting abou=
t their plan to cut Lauber=92s hair. Friedemann followed them to a nearby r=
oom where they came upon Lauber, tackled him and pinned him to the ground. =
As Lauber, his eyes filling with tears, screamed for help, Romney repeatedl=
y clipped his hair with a pair of scissors.=94
> =20
> The Post wrote:
>=20
>      =93It happened very quickly, and to this day it troubles me,=94 said=
 Thomas Buford, the school=92s wrestling champion, who said he joined Romne=
y in restraining Lauber. Buford subsequently apologized to Lauber, who was =
=93terrified,=94 he said. =93What a senseless, stupid, idiotic thing to do.=
=94
> =20
>       Romney could have accepted responsibility for what he did as a youn=
g man -- and acknowledged that it must have been a horrific experience for =
the bullied student.  Instead, when confronted with the charges, he said he=
 didn=92t =93remember=94 the episode that fellow students referred to as a =
=93vicious attack=94.  Then he gave a non-apology-apology.  He told a radio=
 talk show host that, =93Back in high school, I did some dumb things and if=
 anybody was hurt by that or offended, obviously I apologize for that=85=94
> =20
>      In the military there is a tradition that when there is a problem =
=96 when a soldier is called on the carpet =96 the correct response is =93n=
o excuse sir=94.   Not Mitt Romney.  Romney is the past master at ducking r=
esponsibility and making excuses.
> =20
>      Romney may believe that the President of Bain Capital didn=92t have =
responsibility for the company=92s actions =96 but someone should explain t=
o him that the President of United States is absolutely responsible for the=
 work of every Executive Department whether or not he is directly involved =
in every decision.  The President of the United States is responsible for t=
he success or failure of every military mission. He is responsible for prev=
enting recession =96 for saving the auto industry even when it is unpopular=
 =96 for making the tough decisions and living with their consequences.
> =20
>      When you=92re President of the United States you can say, =93oh I ha=
d no responsibility because I left the day to day decisions of the Defense =
Department to others.=94
> =20
>       Do we really want a President that refuses to take responsibility f=
or the actions of a company for which he was CEO, President, Chairman and s=
ole stockholder?
> =20
>      But it doesn=92t stop with personal responsibility.  Romney Economic=
s refuses to take responsibility for the future of the next generation. In =
fact the whole body of radical right wing economic philosophy that Romney h=
as embraced is an absolute abrogation of the concept that we have a respons=
ibility to each other.
> =20
>      The core element of that philosophy is the notion that millionaires =
and billionaires have only one moral obligation =96 to look out for themsel=
ves. They rationalize this unbridled selfishness with elaborate theories ab=
out how their bounty will ultimately trickle down to everyone else =96 how =
they have to make more money because they are =96 after all =96 the =93job =
creators=94.=20
> =20
>      In fact, of course, the real job creators are ordinary middle class =
consumers, whose demand causes businesses of all sorts to hire people to pr=
oduce products and services.  Companies don=92t create jobs because they ha=
ve more money in their bank accounts or out of the goodness of their hearts=
.  They create jobs because someone has the money in their pockets to buy t=
he things that they sell.
> =20
>      But =93trickle down=94 economics is really nothing more than an elab=
orate justification for millionaire selfishness =96 for the refusal of the =
wealthiest Americans to take responsibility for the welfare of the entire c=
ommunity and for the next generation.
> =20
>      The advocates of Romney Economics claim to be hugely concerned that =
we do not leave our children a massive federal debt.  But their concern doe=
s not carry far enough to allow them to agree to a meager increase in their=
 own tax rates to levels that persisted during the 1990=92s when our econom=
y added 23 million new jobs and created quite a number of new millionaires.
> =20
>       They=92re responsibility to the next generation does not go far eno=
ugh to prevent them from despoiling the planet in order to pad their Swiss =
Bank accounts.  It does not prevent them from denying the scientific fact o=
f global climate change in order to prevent oil company profits from declin=
ing.
> =20
>      In fact the irresponsibility of the one percent crowd is little diff=
erent than that of a group of thoughtless teenagers that throw beer bottles=
 onto the highway out of the windows of their cars, not caring that someone=
 else will inevitably have to clean up their mess.   Like the irresponsible=
 teenagers =96 it=92s all about them.  And many of them are so out of touch=
 that they don=92t have a clue about their own selfishness.=20

pton=92s last weekend:
