Hi John,

We ran out of time and had to send a response to Glen Greenwald regarding
his question on the CAP Nov 10 event and Clinton campaign. Here is what we
said:

We did not communicate with the Clinton campaign regarding the Prime
Minister=E2=80=99s visit to CAP. The CAP board was informed and John Podest=
a and
Jose Villarreal are a members of the CAP board. They did not have a role in
making the decision to do the event.


Thanks,

Lindsay
