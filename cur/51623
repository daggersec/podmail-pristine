Hi John, Bruce and Cheryl - I saw Roy Spence today at the health and wellness conference and he told me that it was his next 'life's mission' to help my father (and my mother and family) better tell the Foundation/CGI/etc's story and better tell the Clinton on-going story in the world. I said I would pass along. 
Thanks,
Chelsea
