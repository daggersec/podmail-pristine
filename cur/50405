**Ahead Of AHIP Conference, MoveOn Kicks Off Week of Action With New Print
Ad
Calling Out Insurance Industry War On Health Care Reform
*
MoveOn And Others To Hold A Week Of Anti-AHIP Activities Including Print Ad=
,
TV Ad, Protest At AHIP Conference And Grassroots Activism



MoveOn.org Political Action released a new print ad today on the heels of
the last week's insurance industry report attacking health care reform, and
in advance the industry's conference this week in Washington. The ad, to be
placed in the Washington Post on Wednesday, kicks off a week-long campaign
to call out efforts by the health insurance industry trade group, AHIP, to
defeat health care reform in order to protect their record profits.

You can see the print ad here: *
http://www.moveon.org/pac/healthcare/ads/dropdead.pdf*

The ad condemns the industry for opposing reform when thousands die every
year due to lack of insurance, and reads, in part *"When it comes to health
care reform, one thing is clear: health insurance companies are willing to
let the bodies pile up, as long as their profits are safe."
*
In addition to the print ad, later in the week, MoveOn will release a
television ad, push for the insurance anti-trust exemption to be lifted and
join in an anti-AHIP protest outside the conference in Washington.

=93AHIP and the insurance companies they represent are now waging all-out w=
ar
on health care reform for one reason and one reason only: they want to
protect their sky-high profits,=94 said Justin Ruben, Executive Director of
MoveOn. =93With AHIP in Washington this week, we will make sure both Congre=
ss
and the American people know that, even with people dying every day,
insurance companies are willing to stand in the way of health care reform i=
n
order to boost their bottom line."

*MoveOn.org Political Action is a political action committee powered by 5
million progressive Americans. We believe in the power of small donors and
grassroots action to elect progressive leaders to office and to advance a
progressive agenda. We do not accept any donations over $5,000, and the
average donation to MoveOn.org Political Action is under $100.
