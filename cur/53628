John --

In the next 36 hours, the McCain campaign will be pouring millions of =
dollars -- if not tens of millions -- into negative attack ads against =
Barack Obama.=20

Before John McCain accepts the Republican nomination on Thursday, his =
campaign has to spend every last dollar of primary funds they've raked in =
from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs.

Just yesterday, they aired a new negative ad in 14 swing states. His =
campaign manager even admitted that all McCain has to rely on is attacks, =
saying that for them, "This election is not about issues."

He doesn't want Americans to notice that the Republican platform is the =
most extreme we've ever seen -- opposing stem cell research, denying a =
woman's right to choose no matter what the circumstance, and continuing to =
spend $10 billion a month in Iraq.

With so much at stake, we can't allow another election to be determined by =
petty and divisive political tactics.

Make a donation of $5 or more to fight back against an unprecedented week =
of negativity from John McCain:

https://donate.barackobama.com/fightback1

The McCain campaign is trying to distract voters from the real issues -- =
so we're going to focus on what they're trying to hide.

They've come out against the life-saving possibilities of stem cell =
research.

They don't even mention protecting equal pay for equal work.

They support huge tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of Americans.

They've almost completely ignored the $10 billion we're spending every =
month in Iraq.

And they make zero exceptions for a woman's right to choose -- even in =
cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother.

If that all sounds like more of the same, that's because it is.  John =
McCain is offering a third term of the disastrous Bush agenda, so it's no =
wonder his campaign would choose to focus on attacks instead of issues.

Please make your donation of $5 or more today:

I know we've asked a lot from supporters like you recently, and many of =
you contributed just last week.

But the stakes are high, and there are less than 9 weeks before Election =
Day.  It's going to require unprecedented resources to defeat John McCain =
and bring about the change America so desperately needs.

Thank you for all you do,

David
