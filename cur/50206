As an Iraq War veteran and Colorado resident, I was happy to see over 90% =
of VoteVets supporters choose to fight back against the NRA-backed recalls =
and stand up for State Senator John Morse in Colorado.

So that's what we're going to do.

Election Day is in three weeks, and we're on the air in a big way in =
Colorado defending John Morse, who has been a champion for veterans =
throughout his time in office.

Watch the ad and help keep us on the air.

http://action.votevets.org/recall

These recall elections are a chance to show legislators across the country =
that we'll stand with those who take action to reduce gun violence.

If we beat the NRA here, we'll send a message that begins to dismantle the =
culture of fear the NRA has fostered in Congress and state capitals around =
the country. That's why we're asking people to vote NO on this recall.

Thank you for standing with us,
