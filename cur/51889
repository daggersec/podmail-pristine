oh, and as for POTUS, this is the definition of radical Islam in his
remarks:


"That does not mean denying the fact that an extremist ideology has spread
within some Muslim communities.  This is a real problem that Muslims must
confront, without excuse.  Muslim leaders here and around the globe have to
continue working with us to decisively and unequivocally reject the hateful
ideology that groups like ISIL and al Qaeda promote; to speak out against
not just acts of violence, but also those interpretations of Islam that are
incompatible with the values of religious tolerance, mutual respect, and
human dignity."
