Dear John,
 
I know you have been deluged with e-mails this week but I needed to send just one more thanking you. 

Your support, friendship and input mean so much to me. I could never do it with out you. 

If you have a second, check out our new campaign ad that just started airing today in the New York City market.

[ http://action.kirstengillibrand.com/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=2508 ] 

It talks about some of the reforms and a vision of transparent and accountable government we have been fighting so hard for. 

Thanks again for all that you do.

Kirsten
