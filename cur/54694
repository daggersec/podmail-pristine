Contribute to Ed Markey for U.S. Senate. This is the biggest race of the ye=

John,

Help LCV Action Fund raise $25,000 in the next 48 hours to continue buildin=
g momentum for climate champion Ed Markey's campaign.

Donate today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DlLZ_tTArUEz2VOv_d2P0NQ .

Thanks to you, we had an incredible year in 2012. We won nearly every race =
where we organized and mobilized our members to take on climate deniers. Th=
ank you for being a major part of our efforts.

And now 2013 is here and we have the biggest race of the year heating up --=
 Ed Markey's race to become the next U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. With =
former Senator John Kerry now the U.S. Secretary of State, there is a vacan=
cy for the Senate seat. The special election is scheduled for this coming J=
une and the Democratic primary is less than two months away.

LCV is all in on this race and we need your help to make Rep. Ed Markey the=
 next U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. Let's show Rep. Markey that LCV memb=
ers are 100 percent behind his campaign.

Contribute to Rep. Markey's Senate campaign via LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen=
. With just four short months left until the June special election, it's cr=
itical that Rep. Markey has the resources he needs NOW to take on any and a=
ll challengers: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DSya3J3gJjaRabM1sKtVoDA .

Here's the bottom line: Rep. Ed Markey is one of our biggest champions in C=
ongress. He has led the fight on climate change, clean energy and defending=
 the Arctic Refuge, among many other battles. It is critical that when frie=
nds like him jump into big races, that we have his back and help him in eve=
ry way possible.

Ed Markey's Massachusetts Senate race is THE most critical race in the coun=
try right now. Everyone is watching. We can either build on the momentum of=
 our 2012 victories or take a major step backwards in our movement to addre=
ss climate change.

Remember the 2010 special election? Scott Brown was an unknown Massachusett=
s State Senator in January 2010, who shocked the country when he won the la=
te Senator Ted Kennedy's U.S. Senate seat. The 2013 special election is no =
different=A0-- anything can happen in a short race.

Will you contribute today and join me in supporting Ed Markey's campaign fo=
r U.S. Senate? Let's make sure Ed has the resources he needs to win the Mas=
sachusetts special election and lead the way towards a clean energy future:=
 http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D1wSPthzU1glMX1Iqg-aXPw .

It's critically important to get resources to Ed Markey's campaign now, bef=
ore Karl Rove and the Koch brothers decide to get in on this race.

If we hope to protect our planet for our children and grandchildren, we nee=
d Ed Markey as the next U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. Please, give what =
you can today: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DCS16YJm-FplAut62haagFA .

Best -
