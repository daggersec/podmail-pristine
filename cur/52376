Jake -

I had lunch with Kamala Harris yesterday, and she had a great idea. You guys=
 are probably very, very busy there. I can come to volunteer in your offices=
 from Sept. 12 until the 17.

I can do whatever you need. I have a TS-SCI clearance, but I can also make c=
offee.

You don't need to babysit me - just give me something to do that would be he=
lpful. You also don't need to decide what that might be until I show up. If i=
t works, I can come every other week to volunteer for a week.

If its useful, I'll make my arrangements and show up at your doorstep on Sat=
urday, Sept. 12.
