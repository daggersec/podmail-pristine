McCain Strikes It Rich After Offshore Drilling Reversal
Big Oil execs reward policy shift with millions in contributions

Washington, D.C. =AD When Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) announced his support for
offshore oil drilling in June, he did more than change a long-held position
=AD he also benefited from a gusher of campaign cash from Big Oil donors,
according to a new Campaign Money Watch analysis, It=B9s A Gusher: As John
McCain Fights For Big Oil, They Open Their Wallets.

The report, released Thursday by the nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog,
found that after McCain=B9s June 16 reversal on offshore drilling, Big Oil
interests generously filled the McCain-Republican National Committee joint
fundraising account. The report can be found online at
http://www.campaignmoney.org/mccainoil.

The findings in It=B9s A Gusher include:

=B7     In Texas alone, oil-related donors gave $1.2 million to McCain=B9s
Victory =B908 Fund in June, with 73 percent coming after his reversal on
offshore drilling.

=B7     After McCain=B9s shift, oil executives and their spouses from Color=
ado,
Mississippi, Louisiana, California, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, and
Florida gave donations between $5,000 and $100,000.

=B7     Ten New Jersey and New York based Hess oil executives and family
members made identical donations of $28,500 apiece after McCain=B9s reversa=
l,
totaling $285,000 for the campaign.

=B7     Thirty-three McCain staffers and fundraisers have received a total =
of
$19.3 million in lobbying fees from oil industry clients over the last ten
years.

=B3This report shows a connection between Sen. McCain=B9s shift in support =
of
oil drilling and donations from Big Oil that can=B9t be dismissed as mere
coincidence,=B2 said David Donnelly, director of Campaign Money Watch. =B3J=
ohn
McCain=B9s reversal won=B9t lower gas prices anytime soon, but it did
immediately generate millions of dollars in campaign donations.=B2

The June campaign finance figures in the report are based on original
research of FEC filings by Campaign Money Watch. The other campaign finance
and lobbying figures were based on a Campaign Money Watch analysis of data
provided by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan organization
that tracks money in politics and lobbying.

Campaign Money Watch is a project of the nonpartisan Public Campaign Action
Fund. The organization works to hold candidates who are against reform
accountable for where they get their political donations.
