These will be the most important four days of the election: Donate to LCV Victory Fund and help get out the vote. Give today and your donation will be in the field this weekend: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=pp4x-osnl5uAvk7iItdC3Q

It's now or never, John.

We're $26,500 short of the $150,000 the LCV Victory Fund needs to turn out the vote on Tuesday. Pitch in now and your gift will be in the field this weekend: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=ZREswjhQSRNCAxrDtJmN3A .

When you read this, LCV staff and volunteers around the country will have been up for hours - getting ready to knock on more doors, call more voters, and do all that they can to defeat the Dirty Dozen at the ballot box next week.

It's GOTV - Get Out The Vote - weekend, the final four days to talk to voters before Election Day on Tuesday.

Whether we win or lose on Tuesday will come down to turnout. Between immoral, illegal voter suppression efforts and an influx of cash from Big Oil, LCV's grassroots team has their work cut out for them.

They need your support to get the job done. And if you donate now, there's still time to wire that money to campaign offices for final GOTV efforts.

Chip in to support the LCV Victory Fund's GOTV efforts and your gift will be out to our field organizers and campaign staff this weekend: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=rU0nUCQCtySLQo_CAcm1hw .

Big Oil's allies have been keeping busy, too: running shady attack ads, denying global warming in the media, and planning their first moves once their cronies are in office. We're up against some of the wealthiest, craftiest dirty energy advocates in history, and victory over these anti-environmental forces won't come easy.

But I know we can do it, because I've seen it happen before.

In fact, since 1996, a majority of candidates named to the Dirty Dozen have been defeated. It hasn't happened by magic, though. It happens thanks to the hard work of those staff and volunteers on the ground - and thanks to people like us, who chip in because we believe our nation's leaders should advocate for sound solutions for the environment, not play nice with the corporation polluters trying to
destroy it.

If we're going to maintain a firewall of at least 41 Senators willing to filibuster against the worst anti-environment attacks while also electing new champions to the House, we need every LCV Victory Fund supporter to chip in now.

It's time to go all in. Can I count on you? Make your gift to the LCV Victory Fund right now and your donation will make a significant impact before Tuesday: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=bi-rDKBkQ3Dkf2UsH6yQbA .

Thank you for supporting the LCV Victory Fund. Let's win this.

Sincerely,
Robert Redford

Paid for by LCV Victory Fund, 202-785-8683,and not authorized by and
