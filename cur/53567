John --

Just a few weeks ago, ex-Congressman Bobby Schilling formally announced =
his campaign against us.

That's right, the same Bobby Schilling that voted for Paul Ryan's =
Medicare-gutting budget and the same Bobby Schilling who supported Todd =
Akin's effort to redefine rape.

We beat Mr. Schilling last year because our grassroots network stepped to =
the plate. Now it's time to do it again - before Wednesday's July =
fundraising deadline.

Let's welcome former Congressman Bobby Schilling into this race with a big =
surprise: the largest grassroots movement he's ever seen.

48 HOURS TO GO: Chip in $10 or whatever you can to help take on Bobby =
Schilling and his big-money backers >>
http://action.cheribustos.com/july29-1

Last time Mr. Schilling and I squared off, it was one of the most =
expensive races in the country. And this time around, it looks like it =
could be just as pricey.

This isn't just another deadline - this is the first time that nationwide =
attention will be focused on our race.

Please, chip in before the deadline:

Thanks,
