Hi Milia and Brynne--just spoke with John. Relooping him at his request. I
think where this was left at the middle of last week was that we offered
Teddy, they declined (per traffic below citing the planning committee's
desire to focus the June 9 lunch on redistricting), and Brynne, you reached
out to express willingness to work with them to find someone
else/emphasized how important HFA presence was at this event. Did Scott
ever respond? John would like to know where we're at from there.

The Hill meetings next week are cancelled, yes? Does that free up Amanda or
Marlon to go? Feel free to loop whoever we need but John wants to make sure
we've exhausted all options before giving up.

Thanks!
Eryn

campaign there or just let it slide? Happy to respond however and loop you

Just let me know.

  Milla:

 Thanks for all of your help on this.  It looks like we are going to have a
different focus at our lunch session on June 9th.  Thank you for trying to
find us a good fit, but our planning committee would like to focus on
issues around redistricting.

 Thanks!

  Teddy Goff our chief digital strategist. He's fantastic-- has been
representing the campaign around the country. He's young energetic and
really engaging with crowds.

  Actually, we found a senior staffer who likely can.  Standby.  Milia,
will you make sure they reach out to Scott ASAP?
