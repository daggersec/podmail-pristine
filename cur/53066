From Michael Condon  =E2=80=94 STOP THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE DOL =
PROPOSED=20
RULES

My  name is Michael Condon. I=E2=80=99m a disabled Veteran, paralyzed from =
the neck=20
down for  the last 40 years. I live in San Diego, CA, in a home I rent,and=
=20
I am assisted  by a caregiver paid for by In-Home Supported Services (IHSS)=
.=20
IHSS employs  nearly 400,000 caregivers across the State. Almost 50% of=20
these caregivers  currently work more than 40 hrs/week. In addition, 70% of=
 the=20
IHSS caregivers in  this program care for family members, many of whom=20
require protective  supervision (24 /7 care).=20

The State has neither the funds nor the  inclination to pay overtime. This=
=20
will put me, and hundreds of thousands like  me, at risk of=20
institutionalization. Because our caregivers will be limited to a  40 work =
week, I will be=20
forced to have multiple caregivers while there are  already not enough to=
=20
meet the current need. Please do not institute the DOL  regs. requiring=20
overtime. The disabled, elderly and blind on =E2=80=A6this program would  l=
ove to have=20
their caregivers receive time and a half, but that will not happen.  What w=
ill=20
happen (unintended consequences) instead, the caregivers hours will be  cut=
=20
driving many deeper into poverty. The caregiver loses, the senior/disabled =
=20
loses and the Unions almost double their membership  dues.

Sincerely.

Michael Condon

This is why a 40 hour work  week mandate is bad. It will be financially=20
devastating to 46% of IHSS IP=E2=80=99s  (190,000 workers)in CA alone.
