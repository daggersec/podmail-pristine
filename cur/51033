John --

If you want to wake up on November 7th to four more years=20
of President Obama, and not the alternative, then chip in=20
$5 or more today -- that's just $1.25 for each week we=20
have left:

https://donate.barackobama.com/Four-Weeks

The bottom line is that we're running out of time to get our=20
organization where it needs to be for the final push -- and=20
make-or-break budget decisions are coming up at the end=20
of this week. And, according to our records associated=20
with this email address, you haven't donated to this campaign=20
yet, so, if you've been waiting for the right moment, that time=20
is now.

We have a rapidly shrinking window to hire those last few=20
organizers, open those last few offices in states like Florida=20
and Colorado, and recruit the volunteers who will determine=20
how many voters we reach in those all-important final days=20
before November 6th.

So ... yeah. This is URGENT. It's time for you to step up.

You've waited until the last month to own a piece of this=20
campaign. Don't wait any longer -- your donation is needed=20
right now:

https://donate.barackobama.com/Four-Weeks

Thanks. You're great.
