Likely this week (I am confirming timing with Debbie Stabenow today), Rober=
ts will introduce a bill that postpones the scheduled 7/1/16 implementation=
 of Vermont's mandatory state GMO labeling law (as well as any other state =
initiatives) for a number of years (we don't yet know how long he is propos=
ing) to give the largest grocery manufacturers time to try to implement the=
ir so-called smart label digital scanning solution.  This is an overt attem=
pt to avoid them from having to put a simple disclosure on their food packa=
ging, as is the common practice in 64 other countries including all of the =
EU.  We haven't seen the final language yet, but the idea is that, after th=
e requisite number of years has passed, some third party would be engaged b=
y FDA or USDA to do a national survey and if a certain % of consumers ackno=
wledged that the digital scanning technology was working, then VT and other=
 states' laws would be permanently pre-empted.  Presumably if that % thresh=
old was not reached, the state laws could go ahead.

As you can tell, this is so weak and vague that it instead is really is a c=
omplete and crushing win by industry over consumers' rights to know.  It al=
so is a brazen assertion of federal authority over not only VT's already-pa=
ssed law, but over the 3-6 other states that will likely pass exactly simil=
ar GMO labeling measures this year (RI, MA, NY, NJ) not to mention the 20+ =
other states that are debating equivalent measures.   It is another example=
 of the Republicans' hypocritical practice of supporting states' rights whe=
n it serves them and crushing them when it does not.=20

We are working to either amend or stop it, but they are pouring tens of mil=
lions into lobbying and have already seduced Tom Vilsack into seeing this a=
s some kind of compromise. One of their inaccurate and disingenuous represe=
ntations is that this will help avoid a "patchwork quilt" of different stat=
e bills, but we have ensured that all the state measures are identical.=20

We explicitly counter-proposed to Tom and them that a measure that would be=
 more fair and balanced for consumers and average citizens would be (a) a 2=
-year delay at the end of which (b)  food companies could choose between im=
plementing a federal on-packaging disclosure OR complying with any state-ma=
ndated disclosures UNLESS the testing threshold of a high enough % had been=
 met (we are proposing 90% of those who will be surveyed) of Americans easi=
ly being able to know whether GMO's are in their foods or not.  In this way=
, it ensures consumers that one way or the other there WILL be a working so=
lution in place in 2 years rather than leaving that open-ended.  Our amendm=
ent properly puts the burden on Industry to either succeed in their efforts=
 or accept the consequences if they don't.

Politically, we can expect Bernie to make a passionate demand that the Robe=
rts bill be completely stopped from pre-empting Vermont's and other states'=
 laws, that this is an egregious over-reach by Republicans at the expense o=
f citizens' rights and yet another example of big business's firm grip on o=
ur government (gosh, I bet he might even mention Wall Street).   My guess i=
s that he will jump on this soapbox just as soon as the bill is introduced =
but he also may not wait.

HRC could seize the day and beat out Bernie by inserting into a speech or i=
nterview asap an assertion of her strong support for all consumers, mothers=
 and grandmothers to be able to know what is in our foods, that she is awar=
e of a pending measure that would offer an industry solution in response to=
 the 90% of surveyed americans (2 Mellman polls) who say they want to know =
if their foods contain GMO's and she would be strongly opposed to any bill =
that would not provide an explicit timetable for people having their rights=
 protected and that puts control of the disclosure timeline exclusively in =
Industry's hands...that we are living in a new era in which more and more g=
enetically modified foods are being introduced and regardless of how you fe=
el about that, people want and deserve the right to be able to know; that w=
hen other new technologies like orange juice from concentrate and wild vs f=
armed have come along, the government has had a tradition and a responsibil=
ity to make sure that consumers can know and choose for whatever reason the=
y want, and that this is the way markets work.=20

One other thing...the Industry has spiced up their argument for the digital=
 smart label by saying that they don't want to simply solve the problem of =
GMO transparency, that they want to anticipate other issues that will come =
up (such as humane treatment of animals, palm oil, etc).  This is a straw m=
an...no other issue like that has had one state already require labeling an=
d several more about to require it, not to mention 20+ other states debatin=
g it, and with the recent approval of genetically engineered salmon, apples=
 and other products, it is truly disingenuous to try to lump this in with a=
 bunch of other vague concerns. =20

The bottom line, John, is that Bernie will try to own this issue because it=
 really will play with millennials but the timing of this bill affords HRC =
the opportunity to take that from him if she acts swiftly.   =20

Confidentially, for your eyes only please, this is a video that we will be =
releasing this week which captured HRC speaking in Iowa a few weeks ago: PL=
EASE DO NOT SHARE:=20
https://vimeo.com/154643942
Password: gmo

In a moment, I will share a separate email anecdote evidencing Bernie's lac=
k of political sophistication and consensus-building skills that could also=
 be helpful to you, at least with donors but I want to get this off to you =
now.
