The most colorful moment in Hillary Rodham Clinton=E2=80=99s joint appearan=
ce with
Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday came when they posed in front of the former
mayor=E2=80=99s huge tank of exotic fish.



What had brought them together was a much drier topic: a philanthropic
effort to measure and track data about issues affecting women and girls
around the world.



The event offered a glimpse into the wonky, shared common ground of two of
New York=E2=80=99s biggest political personalities.



Mr. Bloomberg built his multibillion-dollar financial information company
on providing Wall Street traders with reliable data. Mrs. Clinton, who took
a data-based approach to policy, both foreign and domestic, was also
sometimes criticized as a presidential candidate for rattling off
statistics on the stump.



Since she stepped down as secretary of state in 2103, Mrs. Clinton has
worked with her daughter, Chelsea, who also attended the event, on a
separate partnership between the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation
and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that seeks to collect data on the
progress women and girls have made globally.



=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a saying that has served us well in government and=
 in business and
in philanthropy,=E2=80=9D Mr. Bloomberg said as he introduced Mrs. Clinton.=
 =E2=80=9CIf you
can=E2=80=99t measure it, you can=E2=80=99t manage it.=E2=80=9D



Mrs. Clinton added later, =E2=80=9CThere is a shared commitment, some would=
 say
passion, for good data =E2=80=94 understanding it and then applying it.=E2=
=80=9D



Before the event, which drew a crowd of around 200, including many
influential New York women, Mr. Bloomberg and Mrs. Clinton paused in front
of his oversize aquariums before meeting privately.



Theirs is a cordial, if not particularly close, relationship, based on
proximity in New York, if not political party. Mr. Bloomberg, an
independent who won his first campaign for mayor in 2001 as a Republican,
worked closely with Mrs. Clinton when she was a Democratic senator from New
York and regularly speaks at the annual Clinton Global Initiative
gatherings in New York.



The two are said to respect each other=E2=80=99s abilities, and they share =
a
similar hyperkinetic energy and an approach to global problem solving.



Their relationship became somewhat icy in 2007, friends of both say, when
Mr. Bloomberg contemplated running for president as an independent at a
time when Mrs. Clinton appeared poised to capture the Democratic
nomination. But after she lost to Senator Barack Obama, and Senator John
McCain of Arizona captured the Republican nomination, Mr. Bloomberg saw
less of an opening for a third-party, centrist candidate.



Mr. Bloomberg delivered a powerful but late endorsement of Mr. Obama in his
2012 re-election campaign. He has not jumped on the early bandwagon to
support Mrs. Clinton=E2=80=99s likely 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Bloom=
berg is
close to other potential 2016 hopefuls, including Vice President Joseph R.
Biden Jr. and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, who sits on the board of
Bloomberg Philanthropies.



The event on Monday highlighted a joint effort called Data2X, involving
Mrs. Clinton and the United Nations Foundation, that seeks to measure and
track gender equality. Mr. Bloomberg praised Mrs. Clinton, at times
expressing a giddy, self-effacing enthusiasm about their relationship.



=E2=80=9CIf my mother and father knew I was on a first-name basis with Hill=
ary
Clinton, it would be a very big deal,=E2=80=9D he said.



Mr. Bloomberg said he had an excellent relationship with Mrs. Clinton when
he was in City Hall and she was a senator. At one point, he recalled, Mrs.
Clinton was adamant that the State Department =E2=80=9Cdefray the cost of p=
roviding
security to the U.N.=E2=80=9D in New York.



But he joked that she had flip-flopped: =E2=80=9CDo I have to explain to yo=
u what
happened when she became secretary of state?=E2=80=9D



Another measure of his esteem for Mrs. Clinton: As his third term came to
an end, Mr. Bloomberg reached out to her to enter the 2013 mayoral race.
(She did not seriously consider it.)



Mr. Bloomberg also has much in common with her husband. The former mayor
and former President Bill Clinton jointly developed a climate-change effort
focused on improving conditions in cities. Bloomberg L.P. has been a
sponsor of the Clinton Global Initiative, and Mr. Bloomberg gave the
Clinton Foundation $150,000 in 2012 for environmental projects in Haiti,
among other collaborations.



As New Yorkers, the Clintons and Mr. Bloomberg also cross paths socially.
Last month, Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Clinton attended a party the former mayor
hosted for the release of the designer Diane von Furstenberg=E2=80=99s memo=
ir, =E2=80=9CThe
Woman I Wanted To Be.=E2=80=9D



On Monday, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg wasted no time in moving on to
their next commitments. Both left the event shortly after Ms. Clinton sat
down to moderate a panel on Data2X.



As it began, a photographer who had snapped photos of her mother raced down
a tight aisle to shoot pictures of Ms. Clinton.



=E2=80=9CThis is great =E2=80=94 paparazzi for data,=E2=80=9D she said, smi=
ling. =E2=80=9CWe hope that you
come to all our meetings.=E2=80=9D

Hillary Clinton announced new initiatives to improve data collection and
bolster gender equality, expanding a United Nations Foundation program she
supported while she was U.S. secretary of state.



=E2=80=9CWhen it comes to the lives of women and girls around the world, to=
o much
is not being measured,=E2=80=9D Clinton, a possible 2016 candidate for pres=
ident,
said at the Partnering for a Gender Data Revolution event in New York. More
reliable statistics could help =E2=80=9Cbuild a case strong enough to convi=
nce the
skeptics=E2=80=9D that women=E2=80=99s welfare =E2=80=9Cdirectly supports e=
veryone=E2=80=99s security and
prosperity.=E2=80=9D



Clinton said a series of partnerships would boost data gathering about
women and girls in six areas, including poverty levels, access to financial
services and opportunities for employment. The partnerships are part of the
Data2X initiative sponsored by the United Nations Foundation and others,
including the Clinton Foundation. Started in 2012, its goal is improve the
availability of statistics about women around the world to guide policy and
spur economic and social progress.



One of the collaborations is with the World Bank and International Labor
Organization, to measure women=E2=80=99s work and employment. Another is wi=
th the
Global Banking Alliance for Women, to examine how banks underserve women as
customers. There is an estimated $300 billion credit shortfall for
women-owned businesses in emerging economies, a Data2X report shows.



One way Data2X numbers are already being used is to identify why women
aren=E2=80=99t entering secondary schools at the same rate as men, said Jen=
nifer
Klein, a senior adviser to the Clinton Foundation. It and about 30 other
groups, including the Brookings Institution, are backing a $600 million
effort to help disadvantaged girls attend secondary school.



=E2=80=98Broad Range=E2=80=99



Next year, Data2X numbers will be used to track change in child marriage
rates over the past 20 years and show how country-specific policies have
reduced forced marriages among boys and girls under 18 years old, said
Rachel Vogelstein, director of women and girls programs at the Clinton
Foundation. She said her team is working with groups including the
University of California, Los Angeles, and the Economist Intelligence Unit
to make statistics gathered in individual nations accessible and inclusive.



=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s one of the important principles, making sure that t=
his is country
driven,=E2=80=9D Vogelstein said. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s one of the reasons =
that we have such a
broad range of partners.=E2=80=9D



Heather Higginbottom, deputy U.S. Secretary of State for management and
resources, said better data collection could help aid groups understand why
HIV is more prevalent among women between the ages of 15 and 19 at rates
three times higher than men of the same age.



Unpaid Labor



Unpaid labor women perform is widely underreported, according to Data2X
findings. Clinton cited India, where women are doing an average of six
hours of unpaid work outside the conventional economy every day. If they
were introduced to the formal work force, the country=E2=80=99s gross domes=
tic
product could be $1.7 trillion higher, Clinton said.



=E2=80=9CThe economic facts are absolutely clear,=E2=80=9D Clinton said. =
=E2=80=9CInvesting in
women is not only the right thing to do, but also the smart thing,=E2=80=9D=
 and
finding the right data can help target investments.



The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation also support the Data2X initiative. A sponsor of today=E2=80=99s
conference was Bloomberg Philanthropies, founded by Michael Bloomberg, who
is the majority shareholder of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of
Bloomberg News.

December 16, 2014, 5:19 a.m. EST



Two years after launching a project called Data2X, which aims to advance
gender equality around the world, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
on Monday kicked off the next phase of the project, announcing new
partnerships to collect data on gender gaps. At Monday's event, Clinton
explained why she's spearheading projects like this one.



"I have been championing the rights of women and girls around the world, as
well as here at home, for many years," Clinton said, repeating a narrative
she's used multiple times this year. "I got tired of seeing otherwise
thoughtful people smile and nod when I raise these issues."



Clinton has indeed worked on issues relating to women and families for
decades. Yet as a presidential candidate in the 2008 election cycle, the
focus of her campaign fell more on her managerial credentials, with a
promise that she was "ready to lead."



Eight years later, the circumstances are different. Clinton has more
experience as a stateswoman under her belt, American women have embraced
the concept of "leaning in," and women's issues -- such as ensuring equal
pay for equal work, or requiring paid sick leave -- have come to the
forefront of national conversations. Moreover, the very idea of what
constitutes "women's issues" has broadened dramatically since Hillary
Clinton first entered public life.



"We've witnessed a rise in the awareness of these issues," Neera Tanden,
president of the liberal Center for American Progress (CAP), told CBS News.
CAP launched its own campaign focused on elevating policies to help women
and families just last year.



"There's a lot more [discussion] about the treatment of working women,
whether it's positive or negative," Tanden said, referencing a range of
issues, from the discussion in Congress over sexual assault in the military
to news reports on pay disparities in Hollywood.



These new discussions give Clinton a better chance than ever to cast
herself as a champion for women and families. While she has yet to announce
whether she'll launch another bid for the White House, Clinton has this
year taken steps to further solidify her standing as a voice for women.

gender equality around the world, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
on Monday kicked off the next phase of the project, announcing new
partnerships to collect data on gender gaps. At Monday's event, Clinton
explained why she's spearheading projects like this one.



"I have been championing the rights of women and girls around the world, as
well as here at home, for many years," Clinton said, repeating a narrative
she's used multiple times this year. "I got tired of seeing otherwise
thoughtful people smile and nod when I raise these issues."



Clinton has indeed worked on issues relating to women and families for
decades. Yet as a presidential candidate in the 2008 election cycle, the
focus of her campaign fell more on her managerial credentials, with a
promise that she was "ready to lead."



Eight years later, the circumstances are different. Clinton has more
experience as a stateswoman under her belt, American women have embraced
the concept of "leaning in," and women's issues -- such as ensuring equal
pay for equal work, or requiring paid sick leave -- have come to the
forefront of national conversations. Moreover, the very idea of what
constitutes "women's issues" has broadened dramatically since Hillary
Clinton first entered public life.



"We've witnessed a rise in the awareness of these issues," Neera Tanden,
president of the liberal Center for American Progress (CAP), told CBS News.
CAP launched its own campaign focused on elevating policies to help women
and families just last year.



"There's a lot more [discussion] about the treatment of working women,
whether it's positive or negative," Tanden said, referencing a range of
issues, from the discussion in Congress over sexual assault in the military
to news reports on pay disparities in Hollywood.



These new discussions give Clinton a better chance than ever to cast
herself as a champion for women and families. While she has yet to announce
whether she'll launch another bid for the White House, Clinton has this
year taken steps to further solidify her standing as a voice for women.

[Subtitle:] Through Data2x, Clinton unveiled new partnerships to improve
data collection and help address gender issues around the world.



There=E2=80=99s not much news in Hillary Clinton getting on a stage to cham=
pion
women and girls. The former First Lady turned former Secretary of State
turned rumored presidential candidate has made the economic progress of
women a priority throughout her career. Yet after years of finding her
efforts being met with mostly indifference, Clinton is perfecting her
approach.



On Monday, Clinton announced six new partnerships with global organizations
to power a =E2=80=9Cgender data revolution.=E2=80=9D Data2X, an initiative =
announced by
Clinton in 2012, is working to use data to advance gender equality and
women=E2=80=99s empowerment. An initiative led by the United Nations Founda=
tion
with support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation, Data2x provides a
platform for global leaders to foster greater collaboration on the topic of
gender data in global development. Gender data around the world on key
topics remains limited, and Data2x is focused on creating partnership that
will create a full picture of the lives of women and girls. Moreover,
without the right data, Clinton feels that you can=E2=80=99t make the case =
for why
public policies around the world need to change.



=E2=80=9CI got tired of seeing otherwise thoughtful people smile and nod wh=
en I
raised these issues [women and girls],=E2=80=9D said Clinton at an event at
Bloomberg Philanthropies in New York. =E2=80=9CForeign leaders, business
executives, even senior officials in our own government. You can just see
the wheels turning, like, =E2=80=98Oh right, I knew she was going to raise =
women
and girls. I will just smile, it will pass and then we=E2=80=99ll talk abou=
t really
important things.=E2=80=99 Over and over again this was an experience I had=
.=E2=80=9D



Data2x has identified 28 gaps in data on women across health, education,
economic opportunities, political participation and human security. Several
years ago in India, for example, only 6% of women were officially counted
as employed. After further research, it was discovered that women do six
hours of unpaid work on average outside of the traditional economy every
day. If leaders in India brought these women into the paid economy at the
same level as men, the country=E2=80=99s GDP would increase by $1.7 trillio=
n.



This, says Clinton, is just one of countless ways that the numbers can
support a case for a shift in how leaders are addressing the issues. The
International Labour Organization, the World Bank and the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations are working specifically to
help implement news definitions of work and employment with problems like
the one in India in mind.



=E2=80=9CIf you don=E2=80=99t measure, you can=E2=80=99t manage. You can=E2=
=80=99t understand what the
problem is,=E2=80=9D said Clinton. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not enough any lon=
ger to make the case on
moral rights grounds=E2=80=A6We are not making the progress we should be if=
 that is
the principle, and in sometimes exclusive, argument that we are making.=E2=
=80=9D



Other new partnerships through Data2x include an effort to get more women
access to financial services. There is an estimated $300 billion credit
shortage for women-owned companies in emerging economies, and the Global
Banking Alliance for Women along with the International American
Development Bank are collaborating to provide sex-disaggregated data by
banks around the world.



Clinton announced the news partnerships along with former New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, United Nations Foundation President and CEO Kathy
Calvin, and her daughter Chelsea Clinton. Prior to addressing the crowd,
Bloomberg shared that a few years ago Bloomberg Philanthropies started
working to address maternal deaths in Tanzania. Suffering from one of the
highest maternal death rates in the world, Bloomberg dove into the numbers
and discovered that there is one doctor for every 50,000 people. Upgrading
health facilities and training non-physicians to provide emergency care
create more opportunities for Tanzanian women to get the care they need.



=E2=80=9CThere are so many other opportunities to improve lives that the wo=
rld is
not effectively tracking because we don=E2=80=99t have that data,=E2=80=9D =
he said. =E2=80=9CIf you
get the data, you can really target your resources and make a big
difference.=E2=80=9D

Hillary Clinton and her allies were quiet while Sen. Elizabeth Warren
(D-Mass.) led a Democratic uprising in the Senate over changes to the Wall
Street reform bill that were included by Republicans in a $1.1 trillion
government-funding bill.



Clinton didn=E2=80=99t make a peep as Warren, House Democratic Leader Nancy=
 Pelosi
(D-Calif.) and other congressional liberals tore into the White House for
acquiescing to the changes.



The reason for Clinton=E2=80=99s silence, some of her staunchest supporters=
 say, is
that she likely supported the spending bill =E2=80=94 even if she didn=E2=
=80=99t want to go
on record with that support.



=E2=80=9CI don=E2=80=99t think she would have considered the legislation de=
eply flawed,=E2=80=9D
said one Hillary ally. =E2=80=9CShe would have some issues with it, of cour=
se, and
she=E2=80=99d think that it=E2=80=99s not a perfect bill but I don=E2=80=99=
t think she would have
taken Warren=E2=80=99s stance.=E2=80=9D



Clinton allies also echo the White House in arguing that it was better to
make a concession with Republicans and move a spending bill negotiated by
Senate Democratic appropriators than to reject it, which might have led to
a short-term continuing resolution funding the government and more leverage
for Republicans next year when that party controls both chambers of
Congress.



=E2=80=9COther bills have been far, far more detrimental,=E2=80=9D another =
Clinton ally
said. =E2=80=9CThe pros here outweighed the cons.=E2=80=9D



That might be the case, but there=E2=80=99s no doubt Warren=E2=80=99s oppos=
ition to the
bill raised her profile and pepped the spirits of grassroots liberals
hoping she=E2=80=99ll enter the 2016 fight for the White House as a rival t=
o
Clinton.



Many on the left have groused about Clinton, who is seen as the runaway
favorite for the Democratic nomination if she chooses to make a second
White House bid.



Clinton is seen as close to Wall Street because of her years as a New York
senator and her husband=E2=80=99s administration, where years of economic g=
rowth
were managed at the Treasury Department by Secretary Robert Rubin, a
veteran of Citibank.



That=E2=80=99s the same entity that pushed for the change to the Wall Stree=
t reform
bill that was included in the $1.1 trillion spending bill. It allows banks
covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to engage in
derivatives trading.



Clinton supporters say it=E2=80=99s not fair and too simplistic to paint Wa=
rren as
the anti-Wall Street crusader AND Clinton as a friend of big banks.



=E2=80=9CThere=E2=80=99s a perception out there that she=E2=80=99s Wall Str=
eet=E2=80=99s biggest champion,=E2=80=9D
said one former Clinton aide who worked on her 2008 presidential campaign.
=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s not true. She=E2=80=99s just more moderate. And she=
 thinks that we=E2=80=99ve got
to support Wall Street within reason.=E2=80=9D



And while Clinton allies acknowledge the last week has given more oxygen to
the idea of a Warren candidacy, they aren=E2=80=99t signaling it will move =
up an
announcement by Clinton.



The former secretary of State, in fact, seemed to signal last week that an
announcement on her White House prospects could wait until late spring.



Clinton allies also think that a bigger movement that the anti-Wall Street
camp favors her candidacy: The anti-gridlock movement.



Voters are tired of a dysfunctional Washington and want leaders who can
make the government work.



Clinton, like her husband, knows that Democrats have to work with
Republicans to move on legislation, her allies say.



=E2=80=9CWhen she was in the Senate, she worked across the aisle,=E2=80=9D =
one Clinton ally
said. =E2=80=9CAnd she knows she=E2=80=99s going to have to do the same thi=
ng should she
become president.=E2=80=9D



Warren, for her part, earned some comparisons to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) as
she energized House Democrats to challenge their leadership and president
over the spending bill.



Warren is =E2=80=9Can anti-Wall Street crusader,=E2=80=9D the first Clinton=
 ally said.
=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s what she does. I don=E2=80=99t think Secretary Clin=
ton views things the
same way. She=E2=80=99s not currying favors to Wall Street by doing this bu=
t she
just sees it differently.=E2=80=9D



Warren has insisted she=E2=80=99s not running for the White House, even as
MoveOn.Org tried to lure her into the race by launching =E2=80=98Ready for =
Warren,=E2=80=99
website for supporters. As of Monday, more than 23,500 people have liked
=E2=80=98Ready for Warren=E2=80=99 on Facebook.



At the same time, more than 300 former Obama campaign staffers from the
2008 and 2012 cycles wrote an open letter to Warren urging her to run for
president.



=E2=80=9CI think Sen. Warren is tapping into strongly held concerns by many
Americans that they don=E2=80=99t have a shot at a fair deal,=E2=80=9D said=
 Democratic
strategist Jim Manley.



Warren on Monday repeated the notion that she is =E2=80=9Cnot running for
president.=E2=80=9D



=E2=80=9CThat=E2=80=99s not what we=E2=80=99re doing,=E2=80=9D Warren told =
NPR=E2=80=99s Steve Inskeep. =E2=80=9CWe had a
really important fight in the United States Congress just this past week.
And I=E2=80=99m putting all my energy into that fight and to what happens a=
fter
this.=E2=80=9D



When Inskeep pressed her about using the present tense to describe whether
or not she=E2=80=99d run, Warren repeated once again, =E2=80=9CI am not run=
ning for
president. You want me to put an exclamation point at the end?=E2=80=9D

Bill Clinton urged people to move beyond hard-wire racial perceptions and
said that the unarmed black man killed after an apparent chokehold by
police in New York City =E2=80=9Cdidn=E2=80=99t deserve to die.=E2=80=9D



Clinton made the comments in an interview with Fusion, taped during the
Clinton Foundation=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CFuture of the Americas=E2=80=9D event=
 earlier this month. The
full interview will air Tuesday night, and the portion involving police
relations was released Monday.



Clinton said there are =E2=80=9Cpreconceptions wired into us and we have go=
t to get
beyond them,=E2=80=9D and added that there is a =E2=80=9Cdivide that exists=
 between the
community and the police.=E2=80=9D



He spoke specifically about Eric Garner, the unarmed black man killed in a
confrontation with police. Authorities later said Garner was selling loose
cigarettes on a street corner in Staten Island. The medical examiner ruled
his death a homicide with underlying causes related to his obesity and
general health.



The officer involved in the apparent chokehold was not indicted, sparking
days of protests around New York City.



=E2=80=9C[Garner] was obviously not well, he was overweight and vulnerable
therefore had lung problems, heart and lung problems,=E2=80=9D Clinton said=
. =E2=80=9CHe
was doing something he should not have been doing. That was illegal. He was
selling untaxed cigarettes on the street in small volumes, trying to make a
little extra money. But he didn=E2=80=99t deserve to die because of that.=
=E2=80=9D



Clinton=E2=80=99s wife, Hillary Clinton, a likely 2016 presidential candida=
te,
spoke out after the Garner indictment decision and a decision in the case
of Michael Brown, the unarmed young black man shot to death by police
officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. The officer said he was acting
in self-defense and was not indicted.

MoveOn.org officials announced Monday that they have garnered 110,000
signatures on a petition urging Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) to run for
president in 2016.



The announcement comes just one week after the progressive grassroots group
launched a "Run Warren Run" campaign that included a $1 million investment.



Warren has insisted that she will not run for president. And early polling
has former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with a huge lead against any
Democratic challenger.



But the progressive group's calls for a Warren candidacy illustrate
liberals' discomfort with a Clinton coronation, as well as their skepticism
that Clinton is too close to Wall Street.



Warren is largely seen as a populist progressive who frequently supports
more stringent banking regulations.









*The Atlantic: =E2=80=9CElizabeth Warren Is Not the Ted Cruz of the Left=E2=

[Subtitle:] She's more like the Rand Paul of the left.



The symmetry was irresistible. Last weekend, as Ted Cruz almost blew up the
budget deal over immigration and Elizabeth Warren almost blew it up over
banking regulations, pundits seized upon an analogy. Both senators are
articulate, ideological, media-savvy, beloved by party activists, and
problematic for party leaders. Thus, Warren is the Cruz of the left.



Bad analogy, argues Vox=E2=80=99s Matthew Yglesias, noting that it=E2=80=99=
s Cruz and the
GOP that want =E2=80=9Cto use government funding as leverage to undo policy
measures Democrats enacted in the 111th Congress.=E2=80=9D Warren just does=
n=E2=80=99t
=E2=80=9Cwant to pay the ransom.=E2=80=9D The Washington Post=E2=80=99s Sea=
n Sullivan is dubious
too, noting that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner dislike Cruz a lot more
than Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi dislike Warren.



But there=E2=80=99s another, more fundamental, difference. Cruz deepens Ame=
rica=E2=80=99s
red-blue divide. Warren could scramble it.



Think about Cruz=E2=80=99s highest-profile crusades: against Obamacare, aga=
inst
Obama=E2=80=99s executive action on immigration, against raising the debt c=
eiling,
against gun control. They all exhilarated conservative activists and
repelled their liberal counterparts.



With Warren it=E2=80=99s different. Her signature crusade is against the ec=
onomic
and political power of Wall Street. And it=E2=80=99s a crusade that appeals=
 to
elements of the American right. Most conservatives don=E2=80=99t like big b=
anks
either. In 2012, Pew found that while 78 percent of Democrats said Wall
Street =E2=80=9Conly cares about making money for itself,=E2=80=9D 66 perce=
nt of
Republicans did too. Sixty percent of Mitt Romney voters said there was
=E2=80=9Ctoo much power in hands of a few big companies.=E2=80=9D And accor=
ding to a 2013
Huffington Post poll, Republicans agreed that =E2=80=9Cbanks and financial
institutions have grown too big and powerful=E2=80=9D by a margin of almost=
 two to
one.



Warren=E2=80=99s answer to this is threefold. First, she wants tougher bank=
ing
regulation, and since this means empowering federal bureaucrats,
conservatives are overwhelmingly opposed. But Warren=E2=80=99s other soluti=
ons hold
more bipartisan appeal. She wants to break up the big banks. Perhaps
because this does not imply a permanent expansion of government oversight,
conservatives are more sympathetic. According to The Huffington Post, a
plurality of Republicans favor =E2=80=9Ca law that would cap the size of ba=
nks in
the US and force the largest banks to break into smaller units.=E2=80=9D Fi=
nally,
Warren opposes bank bailouts. And because this means less government
intervention, not more, conservatives find it wildly appealing. It was
opposition to George W. Bush=E2=80=99s Troubled Asset Relief Program that h=
elped
create the Tea Party. According to a 2012 Harris poll, Republicans still
overwhelmingly consider bank bailouts a bad idea.



I don=E2=80=99t want to exaggerate Warren=E2=80=99s crossover appeal. Today=
=E2=80=99s parties have
such strong ideological brands that it=E2=80=99s difficult for any Democrat=
 to
attract much Republican support (or vice versa). What=E2=80=99s more, Warre=
n is a
social liberal. And if she ran, the GOP=E2=80=99s Club for Growth wing, whi=
ch hates
her with a passion, would spent vast sums demonizing her among its party
base.



Still, the influx of working-class whites into the GOP in recent decades
has created a wing of the Republican Party that is almost as hostile to
financial elites as are many Democrats. For decades, the GOP has diverted
these class resentments into cultural ones, but that=E2=80=99s become somew=
hat
harder as generational change has made even culturally conservative younger
whites less hostile to blacks and gays than their parents. It=E2=80=99s amo=
ng these
younger, blue collar, Republican-leaning whites where Warren could find her
opening.



What makes Warren so politically potent is that she is heir to both the
progressive and populist traditions. Like the early 20th-century
progressive reformers, she=E2=80=99s wonky, high-minded, and wants to creat=
e new
mechanisms of federal oversight. But like the populists who sometimes
allied with those reformers and sometimes disdained them, Warren is openly
contemptuous of insiders and elites=E2=80=94far more so than either Barack =
Obama or
Hillary Clinton. And that=E2=80=99s the potential source of her-red state a=
ppeal.



The better analogy is not between Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz. It=E2=80=
=99s been
Warren and Rand Paul. Warren=E2=80=99s crusade against Wall Street may appe=
al to
young blue collar Republicans in the same way Paul=E2=80=99s crusade agains=
t the
national-security state appeals to young liberal Democrats. Both Warren and
Paul are exploiting a divide in the other party. Democratic elites are more
hawkish on foreign policy than their party=E2=80=99s rank and file; Republi=
cans
elites are more pro-Wall Street than theirs.



If Ted Cruz wins the Republican presidential nomination, party divisions
will calcify. If Elizabeth Warren wins the Democratic nomination, they may
loosen. That=E2=80=99s one reason so many Democrats hope she=E2=80=99ll run=
.

et =E2=80=9Conly cares about making money for itself,=E2=80=9D 66 percent o=

=E2=80=9Ctoo much power in hands of a few big companies.=E2=80=9D And accor=

overwhelmingly opposed. But Warren=E2=80=99s other solutions hold more bipa=
rtisan appeal. She wants to break up the big banks. Perhaps because this do=
es not imply a permanent expansion of government oversight, conservatives a=
re more sympathetic. According to The Huffington Post, a plurality of Repub=
licans favor =E2=80=9Ca law that would cap the size of banks in the US and =
force the largest banks to break into smaller units.=E2=80=9D Finally, Warr=
en opposes bank bailouts. And because this means less government interventi=
on, not more, conservatives find it wildly appealing. It was opposition to =
George W. Bush=E2=80=99s Troubled Asset Relief Program that helped create t=

ewhat harder as generational change has made even culturally conservative y=
