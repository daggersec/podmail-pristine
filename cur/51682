Dear Mr. Podesta,

My name is Charlie Harned and I'm a junior and Political Science major at
Knox College. I'm the captain of the men's soccer team and we were away
this weekend; so, unfortunately, I was unable to meet you during the
Homecoming festivities.

I'm writing to you because I applied for a White House Internship and have
made it to what looks like the final stage of the application process. If
accepted, I'll be working with Elizabeth Kelly for the National Economic
Council. I'm hoping you'll be able to give me advice with regard to the
rest of the application process. More importantly, though, do you have any
advice that will help me have success as a White House Intern?

I understand how busy your schedule is and I greatly appreciate you taking
the time to help me further my educational and career goals.

Sincerely,

Charlie Harned
