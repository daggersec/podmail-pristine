FYI -

DA response to narrative presentation.

Thank you - very helpful and I do think this meets the Partnership where it=
 currently is.  It will echo well with the rest of the conference.  I will =
send it out to Eric, Kelly, and others along with a revised briefing paper =
and Paul's slides.

See you in Laguna!

 members.  I'm happy to talk about the analytical challenges to narrative i=
n the q and a if that makes sense.

Take care - John
