Scarborough says Algeria donated to Clinton Foundation when it wanted off
'terror list'

Television pundits are raising a lot of questions about *foreign government
donations*
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/foreign-governments-gave-millions-t=
o-foundation-while-clinton-was-at-state-dept/2015/02/25/31937c1e-bc3f-11e4-=
8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html?hpid=3Dz2>
to the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton=E2=80=99s tenure as secret=
ary of
state.

But not everyone get all the details right. Joe Scarborough of MSNBC=E2=80=
=99s *Morning
Joe *flubbed describing the situation in the April 27 show.

He was discussing *a column*
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sloppiness-and-greed/2015/04/24/e4d=
53446-eaa9-11e4-aae1-d642717d8afa_story.html>
by the *Washington Post*=E2=80=99s Ruth Marcus, whose op-ed highlighted an
unreported donation to Bill Clinton=E2=80=99s foundation by Algeria in 2010=
 as an
example of sloppiness. The donation, and others like it, raises questions
about whether Clinton went "soft" on Algeria for contributing to her
husband=E2=80=99s cause under the appearance of earthquake relief in Haiti,=
 Marcus
wrote.

Scarborough said the situation will "stink to high heaven" even if it=E2=80=
=99s a
legal gray area.

"I think it was Algeria, maybe, that had given a donation that went
unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list in
the State Department," Scarborough said. "They write the check, they get
taken off the terror list. ... At the same time, and then it goes
unreported by the Clinton Foundation."

"Is there a quid pro quo there? I don't know, that's really hard to tell,"
he said.

Scarborough went on to break down to his panelists how easy it would be to
explain to voters what might have occurred.

"This is pretty simple stuff. So Algeria is on the terror list, they want
off the terror list, the State Department's making a decision to do it,
they write a check for what? How much? How many million dollars do they
write a check for? I don't know, but Algeria writes a check. You're from
Boston, you know how politics works. They write a really big check to the
Clinton Foundation," Scarborough said. "The Clinton Foundation takes the
check, and then just, out of nowhere the State Department then decides,
well, they are going to take Algeria off the list. Now why did Algeria
write a big check to the Clinton Foundation at the time they want something
from the State Department? That's pretty simple for most voters."

The problem with all of this isn=E2=80=99t the donation, or questions about=
 a quid
pro quo with Algeria. It=E2=80=99s the fact that Algeria wasn=E2=80=99t eve=
r on the terror
list. (*Media Matters*
<http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/27/msnbcs-scarborough-invents-algeria=
n-terror-conn/203435>
first
pointed out what Scarborough said.)

*An ally against terror*

The list Scarborough mentions is a serious designation given to just four
countries the State Department considers *state sponsors of terrorism*
<http://www.state.gov/j/ct/list/c14151.htm>: Syria, Iran, Sudan and Cuba.
President Barack Obama is poised to *remove Cuba*
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/world/americas/obama-cuba-remove-from-st=
ate-terror-list.html>
from the list as a show of improved diplomatic relations. (Libya, Iraq and
North Korea are the only countries that have been removed.)

Algeria is actually a key partner of the United States in fighting
terrorism in North Africa and "has a long history of fighting terrorism,"
the *State Department says*
<http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2013/224823.htm>.

The country spent about 20 years locked in a civil war between the military
and various Islamist groups after an Islamist group won a 1991 election
that was scrapped. The country=E2=80=99s president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, l=
ifted a
state of emergency in April 2011.

But the country continues to *struggle with radical violence*
<http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/170479.pdf> in neighboring
countries. Algeria was attacked by the group that calls itself al-Qaida in
the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb almost 200 times in just 2013 in the form
of improvised explosive devices, bombings, kidnappings, and fake roadblocks=
.

*Human rights violations hamper relations*

The Algerian government is not a state sponsor of terror. But its hands are
not clean when it comes to human rights, which is most likely what
Scarborough was trying to recall on air.

The *Washington Post* story that revealed the Algerian embassy=E2=80=99s do=
nation
of $500,000 also mention that the one-time gift coincided with increased
lobbying visits to the State Department about human rights violations.

In 2010, Algeria spent more than $420,000 lobbying American officials on
inter-country relations and on "human rights issues," the *Post* found,
citing documents filed as part of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The
year also saw an increase in meetings between State Department officials
and lobbyists representing Algeria, growing from "a handful" of recorded
visits in the years before and after to 12 visits in 2010, the *Post*
reported.

The Algeria donation came soon after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake in
Haiti, the *Clinton Foundation said*
<https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press/facts#sthash.CbslGu5F.dpuf>. It
was unsolicited and went to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund,
"where the entire amount of Algeria=E2=80=99s contribution was distributed =
as aid
in Haiti." Algeria had not donated before and has not donated since, a
foundation spokesman said.

The foundation acknowledged it did not alert the State Department about the
gift for vetting, which was required under a memorandum of understanding
between the Obama administration and the Clintons in an effort to prevent
foreign governments from trying to curry favor with Hillary Clinton=E2=80=
=99s State
Department by donating to Bill Clinton=E2=80=99s philanthropy.

So what are the human rights issues Algeria was lobbying on?

Reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the State
Department outline the activities of a strict authoritarian government that
represses its people=E2=80=99s freedom of assembly and association, overuse=
s
pretrial detentions, and employs a judicial system that is susceptible to
corruption.

The State Department=E2=80=99s 2010 report of human rights issues in Algeri=
a
highlights more issues including reports of arbitrary killings, the
government failing to account for people who disappeared during the civil
war in the 1990s, violence and discrimination against women, and continued
restrictions for workers=E2=80=99 rights.

The *government of Algeria*
<http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm> has resisted
inspections by independent human rights groups.

MSNBC's Diana Rocco said Scarborough deserves some credit for indicating he
"wasn=E2=80=99t sure it was" Algeria, and that the exchange that followed "=
clearly
shows he=E2=80=99s using it as a hypothetical scenario to make his larger p=
oint
about how the quid pro quo scenario may have unfolded."

None of that, though, means that Algeria was on the terror watch list in
the first place.

Neither Algeria nor other governments revealed to have given to the
foundation =E2=80=94 Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oma=
n and
Qatar =E2=80=94 are sponsors of terrorism, either.

*Our ruling*

Scarborough was trying to recall the details of a news story about Clinton
Foundation donations from foreign governments when he brought up Algeria=E2=
=80=99s
donation to the foundation to try getting off the "terror list."

There are parts about the donations that may not look good for Clinton.
Maybe it becomes a legal problem, maybe it=E2=80=99s just a political one. =
But to
claim the foundation took donations from a country on the terrorist list is
inaccurate.

Scarborough=E2=80=99s claim rates False.

"><u>a column</u></a> by the <em>Washington Post</em>=E2=80=99s Ruth Marcus=
, whose op-ed highlighted an unreported donation to Bill Clinton=E2=80=99s =
foundation by Algeria in 2010 as an example of sloppiness. The donation, an=
d others like it, raises questions about whether Clinton went &quot;soft&qu=
ot; on Algeria for contributing to her husband=E2=80=99s cause under the ap=
pearance of earthquake relief in Haiti, Marcus wrote.</p>

<p>Scarborough said the situation will &quot;stink to high heaven&quot; eve=
n if it=E2=80=99s a legal gray area.</p>

<p>&quot;I think it was Algeria, maybe, that had given a donation that went=
 unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list i=
n the State Department,&quot; Scarborough said. &quot;They write the check,=
 they get taken off the terror list. ... At the same time, and then it goes=
 unreported by the Clinton Foundation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is there a quid pro quo there? I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s really=
 hard to tell,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Scarborough went on to break down to his panelists how easy it would be =
to explain to voters what might have occurred.</p>

<p>&quot;This is pretty simple stuff. So Algeria is on the terror list, the=
y want off the terror list, the State Department&#39;s making a decision to=
 do it, they write a check for what? How much? How many million dollars do =
they write a check for? I don&#39;t know, but Algeria writes a check. You&#=
39;re from Boston, you know how politics works. They write a really big che=
ck to the Clinton Foundation,&quot; Scarborough said. &quot;The Clinton Fou=
ndation takes the check, and then just, out of nowhere the State Department=
 then decides, well, they are going to take Algeria off the list. Now why d=
id Algeria write a big check to the Clinton Foundation at the time they wan=
t something from the State Department? That&#39;s pretty simple for most vo=
ters.&quot;</p>

<p>The problem with all of this isn=E2=80=99t the donation, or questions ab=
out a quid pro quo with Algeria. It=E2=80=99s the fact that Algeria wasn=E2=
=80=99t ever on the terror list. (<a href=3D"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2=
015/04/27/msnbcs-scarborough-invents-algerian-terror-conn/203435"><u>Media =
Matters</u></a>=C2=A0first pointed=C2=A0out what Scarborough said.)</p>

<p><strong>An ally against terror</strong></p>

<p>The list Scarborough mentions is a serious designation given to just fou=
r countries the State Department considers <a href=3D"http://www.state.gov/=
j/ct/list/c14151.htm"><u>state sponsors of terrorism</u></a>: Syria, Iran, =
Sudan and Cuba. President Barack Obama is poised to <a href=3D"http://www.n=
ytimes.com/2015/04/15/world/americas/obama-cuba-remove-from-state-terror-li=
st.html"><u>remove Cuba</u></a> from the list as a show of improved diploma=
tic relations. (Libya, Iraq and North Korea are the only countries that hav=
e been removed.)</p>

<p>Algeria is actually a key partner of the United States in fighting terro=
rism in North Africa and &quot;has a long history of fighting terrorism,&qu=
ot; the <a href=3D"http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2013/224823.htm"><u>St=
ate Department says</u></a>.</p>

<p>The country spent about 20 years locked in a civil war between the milit=
ary and various Islamist groups after an Islamist group won a 1991 election=
 that was scrapped. The country=E2=80=99s president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, =
lifted a state of emergency in April 2011.</p>

<p>But the country continues to <a href=3D"http://www.state.gov/documents/o=
rganization/170479.pdf"><u>struggle with radical violence</u></a> in neighb=
oring countries. Algeria was attacked by the group that calls itself al-Qai=
da in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb almost 200 times in just 2013 in the=
 form of improvised explosive devices, bombings, kidnappings, and fake road=
blocks.</p>

<p><strong>Human rights violations hamper relations</strong></p>

<p>The Algerian government is not a state sponsor of terror. But its hands =
are not clean when it comes to human rights, which is most likely what Scar=
borough was trying to recall on air.</p>

<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> story that revealed the Algerian embassy=E2=
=80=99s donation of $500,000 also mention that the one-time gift coincided =
with increased lobbying visits to the State Department about human rights v=
iolations.</p>

<p>In 2010, Algeria spent more than $420,000 lobbying American officials on=
 inter-country relations and on &quot;human rights issues,&quot;=C2=A0the <=
em>Post</em> found, citing documents filed as part of the Foreign Agents Re=
gistration Act. The year also saw an increase in meetings between State Dep=
artment officials and lobbyists representing Algeria, growing from &quot;a =
handful&quot; of recorded visits in the years before and after to 12 visits=
 in 2010, the <em>Post</em> reported.</p>

<p>The Algeria donation came soon after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake in Ha=
iti, the <a href=3D"https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press/facts#sthash.Cb=
slGu5F.dpuf"><u>Clinton Foundation said</u></a>. It was unsolicited and wen=
t to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund, &quot;where the entire amoun=
t of Algeria=E2=80=99s contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti.&quot; =
Algeria had not donated before and has not donated since, a foundation spok=
esman said.</p>

<p>The foundation acknowledged it did not alert the State Department about =
the gift for vetting, which was required under a memorandum of understandin=
g between the Obama administration and the Clintons in an effort to prevent=
 foreign governments from trying to curry favor with Hillary Clinton=E2=80=
=99s State Department by donating to Bill Clinton=E2=80=99s philanthropy.</=
p>

<p>So what are the human rights issues Algeria was lobbying on?</p>

<p>Reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the State Depar=
tment outline the activities of a strict authoritarian government that repr=
esses its people=E2=80=99s freedom of assembly and association, overuses pr=
etrial detentions, and employs a judicial system that is susceptible to cor=
ruption.</p>

<p>The State Department=E2=80=99s 2010 report of human rights issues in Alg=
eria highlights more issues including reports of arbitrary killings, the go=
vernment failing to account for people who disappeared during the civil war=
 in the 1990s, violence and discrimination against women, and continued res=
trictions for workers=E2=80=99 rights.</p>

<p>The <a href=3D"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154458.htm"=
><u>government of Algeria</u></a> has resisted inspections by independent h=
uman rights groups.</p>

<p>MSNBC&#39;s Diana Rocco said Scarborough deserves some credit for indica=
ting he &quot;wasn=E2=80=99t sure it was&quot; Algeria, and that the exchan=
ge that followed &quot;clearly shows he=E2=80=99s using it as a hypothetica=
l scenario to make his larger point about how the quid pro quo scenario may=
 have unfolded.&quot;</p>

<p>None of that, though, means that=C2=A0Algeria was on the terror watch li=
st in the first place.=C2=A0</p>

<p>Neither Algeria nor other governments revealed to have given to the foun=
dation =E2=80=94 Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman an=
d Qatar =E2=80=94 are sponsors of terrorism, either.</p>

<p><strong>Our ruling</strong></p>

<p>Scarborough was trying to recall the details of a news story about Clint=
on Foundation donations from foreign governments when he brought up Algeria=
=E2=80=99s donation to the foundation to try getting off the &quot;terror l=
ist.&quot;</p>

<p>There are parts about the donations that may not look good for Clinton. =
Maybe it becomes a legal problem, maybe it=E2=80=99s just a political one. =
But to claim the foundation took donations from a country on the terrorist =
list is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Scarborough=E2=80=99s claim rates False.</p>
