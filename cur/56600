Friend,

We re-elected President Obama. We picked up seats in the
Senate and the House. Now some people think we can relax for
a few years? Ridiculous!

After we took back the White House in 2008, we basked in our
success and lost our sense of fight -- then we proceded to
lose a few key races in 2009 and get our behinds absolutely
handed to us in 2010. That's how President Obama got stuck
with the obstructionist House of Representatives that has
voted to repeal Obamacare thirty-three times.

Well, I'll be damned if we let that happen again.

If we don't want history to repeat itself, we need to double
down in Virginia -- that's why I'm supporting Terry McAuliffe
in his campaign for Governor this year.

Terry has a crucial fundraising deadline this weekend and he
needs your support today. Will you make a $5 donation before
it's too late?

https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/join-carville

I've known Terry for over twenty years, and I can assure you
there is no one better suited to serve Virginia. He'll use
his business background to create new jobs in the
Commonwealth, make sure every child gets a world-class
education, and bring the transportation system into the 21st
century.

But his qualifications don't mean anything if we stay out of
the fight.

The Republicans are pulling out the same playbook they used
in 2010 because they know exactly what's at stake this year.
And I don't know about you, but I like the Karl Rove who was
eating crow this November a whole lot better than the Karl
Rove who was receiving high fives from his cronies four
years ago.

Terry told me that he's $36,827 away from reaching his goal.
Will you chip in $5 before the deadline?

Fool us once, shame on you. Fool us twice...

James
