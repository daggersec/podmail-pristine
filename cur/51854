Remember when Borosage in a fit of envy attacked what we were doing.

Thanks for your note.  I'm around most of the week, though in and out of me=
etings.

I sent the note and email to John earlier this morning. The irony is that t=
he piece opens talking about the unity of right and how important it is, an=
d before it ends Borosage is criticizing on "The Podesta Institute" as he c=
alls it, even before the doors open.

What a world!

Donald

You probably saw this already, but in case you didn't, I'm sending it along=
.
