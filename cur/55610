I'm fine with it.=20
I think, though, as soon as we do it we probably need to dial up what we fee=
d them, since these other people are giving them lots of content and they'll=
 just go back to them if we don't.  Jen I defer if waiting a week helps us i=
n that regard. =20
The other thing we'd need to be very careful about from a compliance perspec=
tive is that we are volunteering to help her make a final decision.  We have=
n't been "hired" and she hasn't decided to run.  It's very important we make=
 that clear. =20
