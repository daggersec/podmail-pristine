John,

Not sure if you are still in China. If you could come to our 10th anniversa=
ry dinner Tuesday night, April 12, we would love to feature a conversation =
with you about your perspective on the progressive infrastructure over the =
last ten years, from CAP to the White House, and also on climate. =20

If you can let me know in the next day or two, I'd be grateful.  Hope this =
works.

Gara
