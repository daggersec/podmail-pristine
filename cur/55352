=46rom everything I have heard I believe this story got the Monday speech th=
e most
correct, and believe it is a huge mistake.  It is not about left versus cent=
er left versus
right.  It is about her being, and being seen as, a corporatist Democrat unw=
illing to
lead or challenge the institutional forces that create economic inequality a=
nd discontent.  I will wait to hear the final speech but John, I hope I am w=
rong but
doubt that I am, and if I am half-right about this, remember where you heard=

it...... Brent
