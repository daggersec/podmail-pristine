The progressive grassroots is starting to take more interest in
McCain. We have some on-message and some off-message signs appearing
at McCain events. To focus the local messaging we need to order some
on-message signs, ship to in-state partners so when they do
counter-events there are good signs for media. Its a few thousand
bucks but the TV and photo visuals are worth a fortune. I'm going to
have some designs done.

verbage might be: McSame, McBush, McCain = Same, etc  The hug is
probably too many colors but we'll look into that.

Suggestions welcome.
