Agree with Jen.
Also tend to agree with her going before him.  Anything other than her taki=
ng quid pro quo of the table, included what would say first, won't take que=
stions about her actions off the table.

But I think it does make sense for her to publicly state that she
never did anything at state to help a donor.  Philippe has been a
proponent of this. She could frame it this way:

1) very proud of Clinton foundation work.

3) if anyone did ever give money in hopes of influencing something
State did - they are foolish bc she never did that and never would.
SOS makes life and death decisions and those kinds of political
considerations don't come into play.

At least this way she will have taken off the table any notion that
there was a quid pro quo - even if some donors may have had bad
intentions.

If we did this, think we should do before WJC interview airs on
Monday.  Which may mean that tomorrow is the last chance we have will
she will be in front of the press (they wont be at fundraisers but
will prob be outside them so she could take a q).

What do others think?
