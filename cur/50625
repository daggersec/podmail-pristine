Rob and John,

I'll do whatever I can to help.

I think I could be helpful coordinating mayors, county executives and others=
  for HRC nationwide.

As a former mayor of a small city and county executive of a large county I u=
nderstand their issues.

I also have two policy ideas that might fit in with your plans:

1) No Wrong Door - one portal for all mental health, drug alcohol, poverty, h=
ousing and other social service issues. More effective way to help and saves=
 money.

2) International Peace Corps - not just UN Peacekeeping forces, but Peacemak=
ing forces.

Who should I talk to? I could start slowly now with a goal of near full time=
 in 2016.

Let me know.

Thanks.


Tom
