The Drano Theory of History =96 Extending the =93Big Change  Moment=94=20

Last year, my friend Mike Lux published a  book called The Progressive=20
Revolution:  How the Best in America Came to  Be.=20
It=92s a study of the history of progressive change in  America.  One of it=
s=20
conclusions is that change is  not spread randomly throughout our history. =
=20
It is concentrated in bunches =96 in =93big  change moments.=94  So far in =
our =20
country=92s history there have been five: =20
=B7       The period surrounding  the enactment of the Constitution;=20
=B7       The period surrounding,  and immediately after, the Civil War;=20
=B7       The =93Progressive  Period=94 in the early 1900=92s;=20
=B7       The =93New Deal=94 in the  1930=92s;=20
=B7       The Civil Rights period  in the 1960=92s.=20
In fact, 19 of the 21 biggest progressive changes in  American history were=
=20
concentrated in only four decades of the over 22 decades  since the=20
enactment of the Constitution.=20
Last Sunday=92s passage of health care reform confirms that  we are once=20
again in the midst of a =93big change moment.=94  Until last weekend, someo=
ne could=20
 credibly argue that the Obama election =96 that the Obama movement =96 had=
=20
only  aspired create =93big change.=94  Now  its promise has begun to be=20
fulfilled.=20
And now there is almost certainly more to  come.=20
When you look back at the story of progress of democracy  in America, you=
=20
are struck by what I  call the =93Drano theory of history.=94  When one =93=
big=20
thing=94 happens, several others almost always follow.  It=92s as if the fi=
rst =93
big thing=94 cleans  out the pipes =96 and then others begin to flow. =20
One of the reasons why last Sunday=92s vote was so  significant is that it =
is=20
likely to set up just that kind of cascading series of  fundamental=20
changes.  =20
First up will likely be a Senate vote to rein in the  power of the big Wall=
=20
Street Banks.  The House has already passed a reasonably robust set of=20
measures aimed at  preventing the recklessness of the big Wall Street Banks=
 from=20
once again causing  the collapse of our economy =96 and costing seven milli=
on=20
more Americans their  jobs. =20
The Senate Banking Committee passed out its own package  of regulatory=20
changes on Monday.  It  will likely go to the floor after the April recess.=
 =20
Immigration reform =96 which has been pronounced dead  almost as many times=
=20
as the now-passed health reform bill =96 has once again shown  strong signs=
 of=20
life.  The giant  200,000 person march for immigration reform coincided=20
with, and helped  stimulate, a serious movement to draft and bring to the S=
enate=20
floor a  bi-partisan immigration bill this spring. =20
There appear to be seven or eight Republicans in the  Senate who understand=
=20
that the future of their Party is contingent on their  ability to attract=
=20
Latino voters =96 the fastest-growing demographic group in the  country. =
=20
Immigration reform is a  realignment issue for many of those voters.  That =
could=20
be enough to pass a bill =96  especially one that is supported by both=20
business and labor, as seems likely. =20
Legislation restructuring our energy economy =96 protecting  us from climat=
e=20
change, creating clean energy jobs and freeing us from the  tyranny of=20
foreign oil =96 is still very much alive in the Senate.  It has already pas=
sed the=20
House.  =20
Representative George Miller=92s proposal to fund over one  million jobs is=
=20
beginning to pick up steam, and the reauthorization of =93No Child  Left Be=
hind=94
 could reshape American education.=20
The opponents of  change were rocked by the victory of health care reform. =
=20
Their entire political strategy was  premised on stopping fundamental=20
change cold =96  keeping the legislative pipes clogged  and then arguing th=
at=20
Washington =96 and Obama =96 were all talk.=20
There are many reasons why =93big changes=94 come in  bunches.  In general,=
=20
fundamental change requires the  convergence of two factors.=20
First, the status quo must become so untenable that there  is substantial=
=20
latent pressure for change from some large segment of the  population. =20
But that first  condition is not by itself sufficient.  Change requires a=
=20
second critical  ingredient.  It requires leadership  that is capable of=20
organizing those with a self-interest in change, and  assembling enough=20
political power to overcome the forces with a vested interest  in the statu=
s quo and=20
the natural fear of something new.  Turning latent pressure for change into=
=20
 active agents of change requires organizations and leaders. =20
You don=92t need to convince the poorest people in the  world that they nee=
d=20
change.  But  the poorest people are often the easiest to subjugate because=
=20
they do not have  the power to resist, to successfully make change. =20
Those with a vested interest in the status quo never give  up power until=
=20
they are forced to do so.  Victory requires the aggregation of enough power=
=20
to force change =96  not beg for it.  Fundamental change  requires struggle=
. It=20
requires that those with an interest in the status quo be  defeated, not=20
convinced. =20
One of the major  reasons why =93big change moments=94 beget other =93big c=
hange=20
moments=94 is that  victory builds the power of the forces for change.  It=
=20
builds that power in particular by  energizing and mobilizing its advocates=
. =20
Defeat demoralizes and demobilizes.  Victories lead to additional victories=
 =96
 and to additional  followers.  People follow winners,  not losers. =20
Political momentum  continues forward motion in politics, just as surely as=
=20
momentum in physics  keeps objects in motion in the physical world. =20
The other reason  why successful =93big change moments=94 are often followe=
d=20
by others is that once  people have experienced =93big change,=94 the fear =
of=20
change itself begins to  weaken.  Fear is the major tool  of those who wish=
 to=20
preserve the status quo.  When health insurance reform does not  bring with=
=20
it the promised =93Armageddon,=94 American voters will be less vulnerable  =
to=20
the fear-mongering that was used so effectively by the insurance industry=
=20
and  Republicans against health care reform.  Their credibility will shrink=
=20
like the boy who cried wolf. =20
The latent pressure for change in the health care system  has been present=
=20
for decades.  President Obama led a movement that, for the first time, was=
=20
capable of  organizing enough political power to overcome the enormous clou=
t=20
of the  insurance industry, the political right and substantial elements of=
=20
the business  community. =20
Different constellations of power present themselves in  the other major=20
issues facing America.  The big Wall Street bankers wield  enormous influen=
ce.=20
 On the other  hand, they certainly convinced a lot of Americans that=20
fundamental change was  needed when they sank the U.S. economy.  People hat=
e the=20
big banks so much that  the banks are trying the Orwellian tactic of naming=
=20
the bill to hold them  accountable the =93Bill to Bailout the Big Banks.=94=
  I=92
m betting this 180 degree perversion  of truth is too much even for the=20
ever-gullible main stream media. =20
But to win the battle with Wall Street, Progressives have  to sharpen the=
=20
distinctions between Wall Street=92s interests and those of  everyday Ameri=
cans=20
=96 and we have to squeeze the Republicans on this issue until  they sue fo=
r=20
peace and agree to pass tough changes in the law because they will  be in=
=20
deep political trouble if they block change.=20
With immigration reform the alignment of forces is very  different.  There,=
=20
business and  labor have almost come to terms on the need for reform.  One=
=20
wing of the Republican Party  understands their long-term interest in close=
=20
relations with the growing Latino  community.  The other wing will seek  to=
=20
play on fear, and blame the lack of jobs on =93immigrant competition.=94  =
=20
To win, immigration reform advocates need to mobililze  the immigrant=20
community and demonstrate its power, at the same time they  reassure swing=
=20
Democrats and Moderate Republicans that a vote for immigration  reform is=
=20
politically =93safe.=94  We  know that when immigration reform is discussed=
 properly,=20
reform receives over  80% support.  But when it is not, it  can be=20
politically radioactive. =20
The other side will try to make the battle about  =93amnesty.=94  Progressi=
ves=20
will frame  the battle as a move to fix the broken immigration system =96 t=
o=20
reintroduce law  and order to a system that has collapsed =96 to combine=20
smart, effective  enforcement and well-regulated flows of future immigrants=
, with=20
requirements  that undocumented immigrants become legal, pay taxes, and get=
=20
in the back of the  line to become citizens.  Progressives will argue that=
=20
we cannot build an economic recovery on a  broken immigration system that=
=20
allows 12 million people to live in the shadows  subject to exploitation by=
=20
unscrupulous employers that undercut the wages of  other workers. Immigrati=
on=20
rights advocates will also argue that their approach  is the only practical=
=20
solution to fix the broken system, since it is neither  politically nor=20
morally possible to deport 12 million people. In fact, the only  alternativ=
e to=20
immigration reform is to continue the broken status quo that no  one=20
supports.=20
To be successful this year, the immigration battle  requires that a=20
bi-partisan bill be assembled during the month of April and move  in the Se=
nate by=20
the end of May. =20
In the battle over clean energy, our opponents are led by  the huge oil=20
companies.  The  coalition for change is well-funded and managed by some of=
 the=20
best political  talent in America.  Once again the need for change is =20
manifested every day.  Enormous  amounts of money are at stake.  So  is our=
=20
national security. =20
It is possible that before the year is out, Congressman  Miller=92s proposa=
l=20
to directly fund a million new jobs through state and local  government wil=
l=20
pick up momentum.  It is likely that the =93No Child Left Behind=94=20
reauthorization will pass as  well. =20
Finally, depending on the outcome of the fall elections,  and the early=20
2011 battle over the filibuster and rules in the new Senate, we  may once a=
gain=20
have the opportunity to pass the Employee Free Choice Act  (EFCA).  In many=
=20
ways passing EFCA  would have more long-term consequences on our ability to=
=20
extend this =93big change  moment=94 than any other factor.  =20
The labor movement is the foundation of progressive  economic change.  The=
=20
stronger the  labor movement, the stronger the forces that can do combat=20
with the status quo.  Had it not been for organized labor, there is no way =
on=20
earth that President  Obama would have succeeded in passing health care=20
reform.  Labor provided troops, money, potential  electoral muscle and seas=
oned=20
political strategists to the cause. They will do  more to keep the pipes of=
=20
change unclogged than any other institution. =20
Of course our ability to maintain the =93big change=94  momentum will be=20
impacted enormously by the outcome of the fall elections.  But it is also t=
rue=20
that legislative  success this year will massively impact our ability to=20
mobilize our base to  volunteer in the elections, to give funds, to go out =
and=20
vote.=20
Passage of health insurance reform has already  transformed the progressive=
=20
rank and file.  Victory caused them to stand up  straight.  It was as=20
though a  giant national shot of =93Red Bull=94 energy drink had coursed th=
rough our=20
 collective veins. We=92ve also seen a sudden increase in the popularity of=
=20
the  =93health care reform=94 brand.  People  love to support winners.  And=
 in=20
the  case of health care reform victory will enable us to highlight the=20
concrete,  short-term benefits of the bill =96not the ogre manufactured by =
the far=20
right =96  from now to Election Day. =20
President Obama, his brain trust and organizers suddenly  got a whole lot=
=20
smarter around 11PM Sunday night when the health care bill  passed.  This=
=20
means that the next  time he calls people to join him in the political aren=
a,=20
they are much more  likely to hustle to the playing field ready for battle.=
