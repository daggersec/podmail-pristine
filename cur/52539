<p><span style=3D"font-size: medium;"><strong>The Buying and Selling of Lie=
s</strong></span></p>
<p>Some of Ohio&rsquo;s leading Republicans continued their assault on Plan=
ned Parenthood, even though their outrage is based on widely discredited vi=
deos, selectively spliced to make it appear as if the iconic health care pr=
ovider illegally profits from the sale of fetal tissue. Democratic anti-cho=

o strip Planned Parenthood of its state money &ndash; even for services suc=
h as cancer screenings.</p>
<p>Although many politicians are buying the lies; most voters are not.&nbsp=
; A <a href=3D"http://act.progressohio.org/go/552?t=3D3&akid=3D783.522478.B=
iS0FJ">new poll</a> by Hart Research shows:</p>

<li><strong>Opposition to Republican rush to defund:&nbsp;</strong>64 perce=
nt of voters, including 72 percent of Independents, do&nbsp;<span style=3D"=
text-decoration: underline;">not&nbsp;</span>agree with Congressional Repub=

<li><strong>Skepticism about impartiality of Congressional investigations:&=

ht reason. The rest view it as a way to push a political agenda.</li>

progressohio.org/go/555?t=3D6&akid=3D783.522478.BiS0FJ">will make the Novem=

<p>"The good news is, we're going to get to the bottom of this,&rsquo;&rsqu=

<p>Even a <a href=3D"http://act.progressohio.org/go/556?t=3D7&akid=3D783.52=
2478.BiS0FJ">past member of Team Romney</a> is asking:&nbsp; Will John Kasi=

OUS support in the state Senate.</p>
<p>Following calls to investigate the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) fo=

lican who got on Kasich&rsquo;s bad side for daring to try to <a href=3D"ht=

<p>State Rep. Alicia Reece, who heads the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus (OL=
BC),&nbsp; reacted to <a href=3D"http://act.progressohio.org/go/559?t=3D10&=
akid=3D783.522478.BiS0FJ">news</a> that a white University of Cincinnati po=
lice officer was indicted for the murder of an unarmed black man who was st=
opped for a routine traffic stop by calling for immediate action on compreh=
ensive justice reform <a href=3D"http://act.progressohio.org/go/560?t=3D11&=
akid=3D783.522478.BiS0FJ">outlined by the OLBC in May</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened here is not just isolated to Cincinnati, but is par=
t of the fabric of what people feel is a pattern nationally,&rsquo;&rsquo; =
said Rep. Reece.</p>
<p>The officer&rsquo;s body camera contradicted the officer&rsquo;s version=
 of events. State Rep. Kevin Boyce said the incident <a href=3D"http://act.=
progressohio.org/go/561?t=3D12&akid=3D783.522478.BiS0FJ">strengthens his re=

<p>In 2012 ProgressOhio asked the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to inve=
stigate coal miner complaints that their bosses at Murray Energy illegally =
forced them to attend a Mitt Romney presidential campaign rally.&nbsp;&nbsp=
; Murray Energy also failed to pay the workers for their time. The prelimin=
ary investigation showed there was merit to the workers&rsquo; complaints, =
but the case deadlocked on a party-line vote.</p>
