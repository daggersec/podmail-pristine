John --

When you and I set out on this journey three years ago, we knew that ours =
would be a lengthy struggle to build a new foundation for this country -- =
one that would require squaring off against the special interests who had =
spent decades stacking the deck in their favor.

Today, it is clear that you have shifted the odds.

This morning, I signed into law a bill that represents the most sweeping =
reforms of Wall Street since the Great Depression, and the toughest =
consumer financial protections this nation has ever seen. I know that I am =
able to do so only because the tens of thousands of volunteers who make up =
the backbone of this movement overcame the most potent attack ads and the =
most powerful lobbying the special interests could put forward.

Our special-interest opponents and their Republican allies have now set =
their sights on the elections in November as their best chance to overturn =
the historic progress we've made together.

Organizing for America counts entirely on supporters like you to fight =
back -- no special interests, no corporate PACs. To keep making change and =
to defend the change we have already won, we need you -- and at least 131 =
other people in Washington -- to contribute so we have the resources =
necessary going into the election.

Please donate $5 today and help Organizing for America lay the groundwork =
for the fights ahead:

https://donate.barackobama.com/WallStreetReformed9

Because of Wall Street reform, we will ensure that Americans applying for =
a credit card, a mortgage, or a student loan will never again be asked to =
sign their name under pages of confusing fine print. We will crack down on =
abusive lending practices and make sure that lenders don't cheat the =
system -- and create a new watchdog to enforce these consumer protections.

And we will put an end to taxpayer-funded bailouts, giving us the ability =
to wind down any large financial institution if it should ever fail.

The passage of Wall Street reform is at the forefront of the change we =
seek, and it will provide a foundation for a stronger and safer economy.

It is a foundation built upon the progress of the Recovery Act, which has =
turned 22 months of job losses into six consecutive months of =
private-sector job growth. And it is a foundation reinforced by the =
historic health reform we passed this spring, which is already giving new =
benefits to more than 100 million Americans, ushering another 1 million =
Americans into coverage by next year.

But today's victory is not where our fight ends.

Organizing for America and I will move forward in the months ahead on the =
tough fights we have yet to finish -- even if cynics say we should wait =
until after the fall elections. This movement has never catered to the =
conventional wisdom of Washington. And we have fought to ensure that our =
progress is never held hostage by our politics.

You and I did not build this movement to win one election. We did not come =
together to pass one single piece of legislation. We are fighting for =
nothing less than a new foundation for our country -- and that work is not =
complete. As we face the challenges ahead, I am relying on you to stand =
with me.

Please donate $5 or more today:

Thank you for helping us get here,

President Barack Obama
