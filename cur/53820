One note on length.


We are not competing with the GOP tonight.


It's just us and Bernie.


My view is that I'd use the opportunity to speak directly to Americans -- and not worry too much if it's 15 minutes or 20.


thanks

Sitting with John, Jennifer, and Maya.  Here are collective thoughts/feedback:

1) The portion of the togetherness riff that talks about small
businesses, we reforms listed in an effort to try and get "dreams" at
the end:
"We will work together to give people the tools they need to start a
small business- for every American with the dream of being an
entrepreneur."

2) In the heads and hearts paragraph, insert WJC riff on making
America whole again.

3) In the Mothers of the Movement section, instead of dedicating the
win to them, instead dial is back just slightly to something like "Our
journey in South Carolina was inspired by Mothers of the Movement..."

4) Kill the tooth fairy anecdote.

5) John thinks the speech is a little long, and that maybe the the
corporate stuff could be a place to shorten it.  We could move it up
in the speech a bit and tighten it so she's mentioning Wall Street,
Johnson Controls, Valiant, but instead of reprising her usual lines
she does quick hits and then move it up, tighten it, and have it be
the lead in to the togetherness pieces, so you do anger then optimism,
not the other way around.

6) Finally, there's agreement that the imagine riff should go in, even if brief.

Dan give me a call if you want to go over.
