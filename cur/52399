FACT CHECK: Health insurers cherry-pick facts
By ALAN FRAM (AP) - 18 minutes ago
http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jd7XMGO_8Itxc4nllZY18KRpE=
EFQD9BB4AR03
WASHINGTON - In its assaults on a Democratic health care overhaul bill, the=
 insurance industry uses facts selectively and mixes accurate assertions wi=
th misleading spin and an embrace of worst-case scenarios.
Take the 30-second TV spot that America's Health Insurance Plans, the indus=
try's trade group, was running this week in six states as the Senate Financ=
e Committee approved overhaul legislation.
With a series of beleaguered-looking elderly people on camera, a soothing f=
emale voice says accurately that Congress has proposed cutting more than $1=
00 billion from Medicare Advantage. The program, administered by private co=
mpanies that provide extra services like eye and dental care, serves about =
a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries, more than 10 million people.
Then the announcer adds, "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says =
many seniors will see cuts in benefits." Words flash on the screen for thre=
e seconds saying, "50 percent reduction in extra benefits."
The announcer's words are true - but could be easily misunderstood to mean =
that basic Medicare coverage is at risk.
The budget office's director, Douglas Elmendorf, has said that as a result =
of the proposed cuts, the extra benefits Medicare Advantage recipients rece=
ive would be halved over the next decade. But the ad leaves unspoken the fa=
ct that under the Finance bill, Medicare coverage for doctors, hospitals an=
d other basic services would remain fully intact, with no reduction in bene=
fits.
The ad also fails to mention the reason senators targeted Medicare Advantag=
e for savings: The program is expensive for the government to administer, c=
osting about 14 percent more per recipient than regular Medicare.
Robert Zirkelbach, the trade group's spokesman, says the ad does not attack=
 anyone.
"Seniors have a right to know how the current legislation will impact their=
 health security," he said.
Even so, the ad illustrates a favored tactic of Washington interest groups,=
 which is to arouse worry about a bill among a key constituency - in this c=
ase, elderly voters.
"Call your senators. Tell them we need health care reform that protects sen=
iors," the announcer concludes.
A study the health insurers released earlier this week takes similar libert=
ies. It concludes that Democrats' health care effort would drive up premium=
s for insured people, based on cherry-picking convenient facts and perspect=
ives. It's an example of the classic lobbying tactic of commissioning a rep=
ort that, predictably, reinforces an interest group's views.
The study only examined four parts of the Finance bill that it said would b=
oost consumers' costs. It ignored provisions aimed at making health care mo=
re affordable, such as exchanges whereby companies would compete for custom=
ers and subsidies to help lower-income people afford policies.
PricewaterhouseCoopers, the financial analysis firm the insurance industry =
commissioned to write the report, issued a statement this week noting it ha=
d been asked to only focus on four aspects of the bill: its weak enforcemen=
t mechanisms for the requirement that everyone buys insurance, an excise ta=
x on expensive insurance policies, cuts in overall Medicare spending and fe=
es on health care providers.
Provisions aimed at reducing costs, if successful, "would offset some of th=
e impacts we have estimated," the accounting firm acknowledged.
One conclusion the report draws was mirrored by a fresh study released Wedn=
esday by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association: For the health overhau=
l to work, there must be strong ways to enforce the requirement that people=
 buy insurance.
Before the Finance Committee approved its bill, senators reduced the fines =
uninsured people would have to pay. The insurers argue that means many youn=
g, healthy people would remain uninsured, driving up costs for everyone els=
e who purchases insurance - a conclusion that analysts generally agree is v=
alid.
"Gee golly whiz. I could pay a $400 fine and get insurance when I need it, =
or pay $8,000 in premiums" per year, said Robert Laszewski, a private healt=
h policy analyst. He said the choice many families would make is "blindingl=
y obvious."
The insurers' study concludes that insurance companies, medical device make=
rs and other providers will pass on to consumers all the new taxes and fees=
 the Finance bill imposes. It also assumes that doctors, hospitals and othe=
r health care providers would fully pass on the cuts lawmakers would make i=
n Medicare, which total about $500 billion over 10 years.
It's an economic fact of life that businesses generally pass on the costs o=
f taxes by raising prices. It's also fair to assume that when doctors and o=
ther providers see a reduction in income from their Medicare patients, they=
 seek to make it up, if possible, from the rest of their patients.
Yet concluding that providers will pass the full cost of these changes to t=
heir customers ignores a basic assumption of the health overhaul effort. Th=
e goal is to increase competition and reduce the rate of growth currently a=
ssumed in medical costs. If the overall legislation succeeds in doing that,=
 there would be less incentive for providers to pass on those costs - and m=
ore incentives for them to compete by keeping prices low.
