Where I'm disagreeing with this group is precisely on the words Glass
Steagall.  No one knows what it is, but being on the wrong side of it is
dangerous.  So I'm not committing her to reinstate it, but I also think
shutting it down is ill advised; I fear that in the black and white world
we're living in, that is shorthanded as pro-bank.  So that is why I would
remain open to it as a policy option in the future.
