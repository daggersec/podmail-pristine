Hi,

I am writing to invite you to participate in a unique, behind the scenes =
experience at this year's Democratic National Convention by joining the =
country's top new media journalists, bloggers, opinion leaders and special =
guests in The Big Tent.

Located across the street from the Pepsi Center and sponsored by Google, =
You Tube, Digg and others, The Big Tent is a 24-7 communications hub for =
progressive convention goers. Hundreds of the top bloggers and new media =
journalists will headquarter in the Big Tent's Blogger Lounge. Convention =
insiders will broadcast their own YouTube videos from the Google Retreat. =
The Big Tent will also play host to dozens of private briefing with =
today's top opinion leaders including: Robert Kennedy Jr., John Podesta, =
Arianna Huffington, Van Jones, T. Boone Pickens, Majora Carter, Eli =
Pariser, and others.=20

As a "Friend of the Tent", you will have an four-day All Access pass to =
the The Big Tent.  Over the last few years, the blogs have broken the =
mainstream media dominance of the country's political conversation =
breaking critical stories, pushing important under-reported stories to the =
forefront of the national conversation and forcing balance from the =
mainstream media.=20

And at this year's Convention, for the first time, you will have a chance =
to watch it all happen.  In real time.=20

Please note, "Friend of the Tent" All Access passes are extremely limited. =
 These passes are by invitation only.  However, you may share this =
invitation with your immediate family members if you wish. Registration is =
$1,500 per person. To register, please visit:

http://www.ProgressNowAction.org/BigTentSpecialGuests

And if you have any questions, please feel free to call Brittney Wilburn =
at 303-905-8375.

Thank you and we hope to see you in The Big Tent!

Sincerely,
Michael Huttner ----
