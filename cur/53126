The way we left it on our call yesterday was that jen from cap and eric =
from media matters were going to talk to each other, to tara, to =
christina, ari etc as they try to knit something together that works
That's how the conversation should proceed I think before we can answer =
the kinds of questions being asked

 Team,
=20
 Tara and I spoke with Ari and Christina. They really are smart and
 committed to the work.
=20
 They have a lot of questions that I can't answer. They want to join
 the conversation rather than be subject to it. Seems fair. Because Ari
 gets married on Sunday we have a window to have them all on the line
 Thursday afternoon. Ari meets with his wedding Rabbi at 4:30 Eastern
 but we're otherwise clear on our end. Can we try 3:00 PM Thursday?
=20
 There was also a feeling that we should open-source a lot of the
 resources that we have--dump the research book and the video, etc.. on
 the web. Something to discuss.
=20
 best,
=20
 -Tom
