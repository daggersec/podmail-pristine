http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/04/20/omalleys-amnesia-on-marriage/

O=E2=80=99Malley=E2=80=99s amnesia on marriage
There he goes again. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O=E2=80=99Malley, who once=
 extolled the virtues of centrism, now wants us to believe =E2=80=94 in an =
unintentionally hilarious rewriting of history =E2=80=94 that he=E2=80=99s =
more liberal than Hillary Clinton and a =E2=80=9Cprofile in courage=E2=80=
=9D when it comes to fighting for marriage equality.

In a not-so-subtle jab at Clinton, O=E2=80=99Malley in a February speech sa=
id, =E2=80=9CHistory celebrates profiles in courage, not profiles in conven=
ience. The dignity of every person tells us that the right to marry is not =
a state right, it is a human right.=E2=80=9D

A Clinton aide last week, responding to a Blade inquiry, affirmed that the =
2016 hopeful views same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. That statem=
ent marked a change from her earlier position, articulated in an infamous N=
PR interview last year, that she viewed marriage as a state issue.

Clinton, like President Obama and Martin O=E2=80=99Malley and many others e=
volved on the issue.

The problem with O=E2=80=99Malley is that he=E2=80=99s had more positions o=
n marriage than all the 2016 hopefuls combined. And after pushing for civil=
 unions right up until 2011, he now wants voters to believe that he=E2=80=
=99s a pioneer on the issue. What nerve!

Let=E2=80=99s revisit O=E2=80=99Malley=E2=80=99s actual record rather than =
listen to his calculated amnesia.

 In 2004, O=E2=80=99Malley told a Baltimore TV station, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99=
m not opposed to civil marriages.=E2=80=9D Also that year, he emailed a pla=
intiff in the state marriage lawsuit that read, =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m just s=
upporting something I strongly believe in,=E2=80=9D referring to marriage e=
quality. But by 2006, O=E2=80=99Malley=E2=80=99s position was shifting and =
he said, =E2=80=9CI was raised to believe that marriage is between a man an=
d a woman. This is a fundamental issue of the state=E2=80=99s public policy=
, and a decision that ultimately should not be made by a single trial court=
 judge.=E2=80=9D When confronted by gay activists after issuing that statem=
ent, O=E2=80=99Malley disavowed any previous support of marriage equality.

After a 2007 Maryland court ruling limiting marriage to opposite-sex couple=
s, O=E2=80=99Malley issued the following statement as heartbroken gay resid=
ents were busy cancelling their weddings and mourning the court=E2=80=99s m=
isguided decision: =E2=80=9CI look forward to reading the court=E2=80=99s f=
ull opinion, but as we move forward, those of us with the responsibility of=
 passing and enforcing laws have an obligation to protect the rights of all=
 individuals equally, without telling any faith how to define its sacrament=
s. I respect the court=E2=80=99s decision.=E2=80=9D

Privately, O=E2=80=99Malley had assured gay rights activists and plaintiffs=
 in the case that he supported marriage equality, only to reverse course an=
d ultimately invoke his Catholic religious beliefs to justify his support o=
f discrimination.

From 2008-2010, O=E2=80=99Malley publicly backed civil unions as bills to l=
egalize marriage equality were defeated in committee. He was even booed off=
 the stage at a private LGBT donor gathering after advocating for civil uni=
ons over full marriage rights.

In 2011, O=E2=80=99Malley finally said he would sign a marriage bill if pas=
sed. =E2=80=9CI have concluded that discriminating against individuals base=
d on their sexual orientation in the context of civil marital rights is unj=
ust.=E2=80=9D That bill ultimately failed.

It wasn=E2=80=99t until New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo embraced the cause of ma=
rriage equality as a civil rights issue =E2=80=94 and well after Maryland A=
ttorney General Doug Gansler did the same =E2=80=94 that O=E2=80=99Malley e=
volved yet again. Whereas Cuomo made it clear even before he was elected th=
at he supported full marriage rights and then lobbied for the needed votes =
to pass it, O=E2=80=99Malley was =E2=80=94 until 2012 =E2=80=94the reluctan=
t advocate, offering meek, private assurances of support but refusing to pu=
blicly embrace the cause, even after winning a second term in a landslide.

Though he eventually came around to full support and was instrumental in pr=
eserving the law after it went to referendum, O=E2=80=99Malley was late to =
the marriage party and certainly doesn=E2=80=99t deserve credit for its suc=
cess.

O=E2=80=99Malley has, for years, embodied the poll-driven milquetoast polit=
ician who checks the wind before staking out a position. Now he wants us to=
 believe otherwise.

=E2=80=9CWe have the ability as a party to lead by our principles or are we=
 going to conduct polls every time we try to determine where the middle is =
on any given day,=E2=80=9D he told NPR this week.

We should welcome O=E2=80=99Malley=E2=80=99s more progressive positions wit=
hout forgetting his disappointing record of saying one thing in private and=
 the opposite when the cameras are rolling.
