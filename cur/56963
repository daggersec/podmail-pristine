ACORN's Election Day Notes From The
Field<http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=9692>ACORN is going
to be updating this blog posting all day with new stories
from our field organizers. So far what we are seeing are a few problems
amidst huge turnouts and largely smooth voting.

In general, the levels of excitement in ACORN neighborhoods are very high
and there are stories of persistence in the face of barriers like
poorly-trained poll workers, long lines, and bureaucratic snafus.

We've arranged these stories by state and city and we feel that give a good
on-the-ground sense of how people are reacting on this historic Election
Day.

Florida - Orlando
Orlando ACORN has close to 200 canvassers hitting 25,000 doors split between
African-American communities in western Orange County and Latino
neighborhoods in eastern and southern Orange County. Contact Stephanie Porta
at flacornorho@acorn.org or 407-592-4784

Florida - Orlando - Personal Story
Mary Lynn Plotkin is a story of persistence. Excited about participating in
this historic election she showed up at her polling place at 6:30 AM, only
to be turned away by a poorly-trained poll worker because "there was no
place to park". She works 20 miles away from her polling place, so she went
to work, complained to the Bureau of Elections, and then four hours later,
went back to the polling place. In a reassuring turn of events, the poll
workers actually apologized to her about being turned away. She waited with
about 50 other people and it took her about 30 minutes to vote.

Indiana - Indianapolis
ACORN Leader Mary Sears has taken 120 people to the polls so far and has
never seen anything like this in the 41 years she has been voting. She is
particularly seeing young and minority voters, and lines are one to two
hours but seem to be moving with no major problems. Everyone seems to be
excited! Contact: Jeff Ordower at moacorn@acorn.org or (314) 531-9634

New Mexico - Statewide
New Mexico ACORN is knocking on 10,000 doors today in three counties with
165 canvassers. New and infrequent voters in Dona Ana (Las Cruces),
Bernalillo (Albuquerque) and Valencia (Santa Fe) will be getting visits from
ACORN today. Early voting in Albuquerque was well over 50% of the total
turnout for 2004.
Contact Matthew Henderson for more information - nmacorn@acorn.org -
505-379-6947

Pennsylvania - North Philly
There was a sense of excitement and taking part in an historic event here in
North Philadelphia. People are taking pictures of their friends and family
in front of the "Vote Here" signs, and of the long lines. On woman was
spontaneously yelling lines from MLK's "Mountain Top" speech from 1968 in
Memphis at the top of her lungs. Lines were down the entire city block.
Contact Ali Kronley at paacorn@acorn.org or 267-408-5582
Pennsylvania - Pittsburgh
At the Temple Baptist Church on Race St. in the Homewood neighborhood of
Pittsburgh (an ACORN neighborhood) voting machines broke down for a little
over an hour. With lines heading out the door, no paper ballots were
available to be handed out. Most people waited, but a number chose to leave.
Many of the people in line voiced anger and frustration but tried to be
patient. They finally got the machines working but it is unclear if paper
ballots were ever delivered. For more info contact MaryEllen Hayden at
paacornpiho@acorn.org
