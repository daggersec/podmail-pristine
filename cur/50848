<br>
We had occasion on this trip collectively to assess our team needs for the =
upcoming year and beyond. We concluded we needed 1-2 positions in Washingto=
n that were not=C2=A0 contemplated in our Year 2 plan.<br>
<br>
I want to flag that decision for you as we likely will have position descri=
ptions on Thursday of this week and then will begin a search in earnest rel=
atively quickly. Our goal is to hire for these positions to start as early =
in the New Year as is practical, which I anticipate will be a four - six we=
ek timeline (includes search, interviews, performance assessments, vetting,=
 and on-boarding).<br>
<br>
I welcome your influence in this process by sharing, based upon your unders=
tanding of enterprise, those areas where you believe your talents=C2=A0 mig=
ht best be deployed, consistent with our needs and with inspiring you to wa=
nt to undertake such areas/responsibilities. If that is something you can r=
eflect upon and share early this week that would be ideal. That would allow=
 your suggestions to be organically considered in position description deve=
lopment process.<br>
<br>
And, once I have the proposed descriptions in hand, I still will welcome yo=
ur feedback for our benefit and separately, to learn if the role might be o=
f interest to you. I hope it will be.<br>
<br>
Best.<br>
