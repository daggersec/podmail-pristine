Dear John,

The military's "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy is an unjust, outdated, and harmful rule that violates the civil rights of some of our bravest, most heroic men and women.

That's why I have been working, along with my colleagues in the Senate and so many of you, to overturn this wasteful and destructive policy.

Last weekend, President Obama restated his commitment to overturning "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and this summer, I convinced Senator Carl Levin, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to hold the first Senate hearing on its repeal. This hearing is scheduled to start within the next several weeks. While we have made great strides, there is still a lot of work to do.

We have to prepare for these hearings, so I'm launching a nationwide call to action.  My goal is to get thousands of people to stand with me and show that this country is ready to repeal DADT.

Click here to help end "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."  I want to show my colleagues that America is ready to do the right thing.

Numerous military leaders are already telling us that this policy should be reversed. Having lost over 13,000 of our best and brightest to this policy, including almost 800 in "mission critical" areas, the time for change is now.

We must all join together now and speak up on behalf of the brave men and women who only want to serve their country.

The announcement of hearings this fall is great news and a critical milestone on the road to repeal.  In addition, the Pentagon's Joint Force Quarterly just published an article calling for an end to the ban on gays and lesbians serving in our armed forces.  Click here to help end "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."

I need your support right away, but moreover, I need you to share our call to action with your friends and colleagues who want to repeal DADT, too.  Earning the broadest support possible is the only way to convey the message this Fall that the American people want to undo this harmful policy.

Click here to help end "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."  I want to show my colleagues that America is ready to do the right thing.

Thank you so much for your continued support.  Together, I am sure that we can make America stronger and bring equality to our Armed Services.

Sincerely,
Kirsten Gillibrand
