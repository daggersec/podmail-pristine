[12:28:33 PM] ANDREA MITCHELL: Hillary Clinton has left Iowa, and she's
planning her next trip to New Hampshire next week. Joining me now for our
Daily Fix: Chris Cillizza, MSNBC contributor and founder of The Washington
Post=E2=80=99s The Fix blog; MSNBC political reporter Alex Seitz-Wald; and =
New York
Times political reporter Amy Chozick. Thanks all. Alex, first to you. We
were there, trying to get questions to her.  Let=E2=80=99s take a look at w=
hat
the campaign posted on flicker, which is the campaign=E2=80=99s
still photographer's pictures of the final event yesterday =E2=80=93 not an=
nounced,
not on the schedule. She goes up to the state capitol. You can see this is
a rather large gathering. We had people outside. Dan Balz and others from
The Washington Post were outside. Amy, I don't know where you were at that
hour, but this was 3 o=E2=80=99clock or so in the afternoon =E2=80=93 plent=
y of time for
all of us to file and nobody was able to cover this. Fair game?



[12:29:26 PM] ALEX SEITZ-WALD: Yeah, I mean, this was typical
throughout her Iowa tour and I was there outside the room as well. We had
gotten tipped off =E2=80=93 there was word =E2=80=93 but this was a problem=
 throughout. You
know, they had these two big, anchor events, which were clearly meant to
give us something to cover. Meanwhile, we were chasing her throughout the
state while she was doing these, kind of, main events =E2=80=93 meeting wit=
h people
in coffee shops and meeting with state legislators here. And I think what
frustrated reporters was not that she wanted to do events in private, but
that we got so little heads up on it, so little warning on it. And, you
know, she's trying to execute two simultaneous resets. She=E2=80=99s trying=
 to
reset in Iowa and she=E2=80=99s also trying to reset with the press and the=
se
things are in tension with each other. And she went with Iowa over
the press, clearly, here.



[12:30:02 PM] MITCHELL: Amy, what is your takeaway from all of this?
Especially since what news was made yesterday happened in a statement from
her campaign office, which was a recasting let's say, to be kind, of
what she said last summer to Terry Gross during the book tour on NPR about
same-sex marriage. She's now affirmatively declaring that the Supreme
Court should grant the constitutional right as a national issue rather than
progress state by state.



[12:30:27 PM] AMY CHOZICK: Right, and I think they did something similar
this morning in releasing something to the Huffington Post about her stance
on giving driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. And so, this sort
of trickle of news, while Andrea, you and I and Alex are out there sort of
killing ourselves to cover the events, I think it does create a
tension. You know, from what I heard from her campaign, they recognize
that. They say they=E2=80=99re they=E2=80=99re to figure these things out. =
But you can not
expect the national news media to cover, sort of, the gauzy events and get
the beautiful photos without, you know, having the ability to ask the
candidate questions. And I=E2=80=99ve been assured that, you know, that mig=
ht
change in the future. But, I also think that what=E2=80=99s so interesting =
is this
small strategy, this talking to six Iowans. I mean, let=E2=80=99s be real, =
it=E2=80=99s
completely dependent on the national news media to broadcast that to the
world =E2=80=93 those small moments to the world. You know, it=E2=80=99s no=
t just about
talking to six Iowans in a quaint coffee shop. It=E2=80=99s about broadcast=
ing that
and so it is a symbiotic relationship and I think they realize that they
need to sort of figure things out. You know, as well as we do in covering
these things. And I=E2=80=99ve got to give it to Alex. He=E2=80=99s the her=
o for not
running after that van.



[12:31:35 PM] MITCHELL: The most incredible self-restraint. You were on the
air live when all that was going down. It went viral. Chris Cillizza, I
mean, this is the age-old tension. But, we=E2=80=99ve never seen quite as
profoundly disparate, the division between the coffee shop where we now
learn people were actually driven in, pre-screened and cleared. They want
the national media there to take the picture but there=E2=80=99s no one the=
re to
ask a question or to provide any, you now, context, unlike the traditional
White House pools. I mean, we=E2=80=99ve covered these campaigns: Hillary C=
linton
in New York state in 2000; Hillary Clinton all over the country in 2007 and
2008. She had secret service in both instances [inaudible] =E2=80=9COh ther=
e=E2=80=99s a
security reason why you can=E2=80=99t get close.=E2=80=9D We covered the pr=
esident of
the United States =E2=80=93 successive presidents =E2=80=93 all over the co=
untry for
years and years with secret service and we get to ask questions.



[12:32:29 PM] CHRIS CILLIZZA: The problem here Andrea =E2=80=93 and the Oba=
ma
administration has taken this to a certain degree and whoever the next
president is, Republican or Democrat, will probably take it to an
even further degree =E2=80=93 which is, the rise of technology, the rise of=
 Twitter
and Instagram, and Flickr, as you mentioned, YouTube. There's a strong
sense if you're Hillary Clinton, who is, you know, universally known, she
doesn't have the Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio problem where they need the media,
at some level, to, sort of, get them more known. She doesn=E2=80=99t need t=
he media
go get here more known. She just sort of end-runs it. As Amy mentioned, she
parcels out pieces of news as she sees fit to organizations she sees fit
and then she does things like puts up a video, sends an e-mail
to supporters. The Obama campaign did this brilliantly. We know Hillary=E2=
=80=99s
already got a lot of the people from the Obama campaign, but I think she's
going to take that blueprint and, sort of, do everything she can to end-run
us to the point at which everyone throws up their hands and then, I think,
they will sort of say, =E2=80=9COh okay, here's this thing.=E2=80=9D But, H=
illary Clinton
is never going to be =E2=80=93 maybe no candidate will be anymore =E2=80=93=
 but the John
McCain circa 1999 and 2000, back of the bus everybody asking
questions. That's never, ever, ever, ever going to be her.  I don't think
any of us want that, although it would be great, but something more in
the middle, equitable, I think, is what we're all sort of aiming for.



[12:33:52 PM] ANDREA MITCHELL: And Amy, the other news on the Clinton
foundation, they have now decided they are going to keep accepting
foreign donations. She resigned from the foundation on Sunday night after
declaring her candidacy =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s the family foundation. She w=
as being
criticized from accepting money from Saudi Arabia and other, you
know, countries that have terrible policies in contrast to her own policy
towards women's rights. So now they are going to accept money from, you
know, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, the U.K. Basically, from
Anglo-Saxon countries and not the Middle Eastern countries. How does that
get around the potential conflict of interest should she become POTUS?



[12:34:30 PM] AMY CHOZICK: Right. And you know, President Clinton has said
he intends to continue to run the foundation =E2=80=93 not just through
the campaign, but should she win the White House. He said, =E2=80=9CI would=
 keep
the place in Chappaqua, and continue to run the foundation.=E2=80=9D Obviou=
sly
there were appearances of conflicts at the State Department and I think
that those would just be exacerbated should she, you know, obviously win
the White House. Of course, the Clinton Foundation says, =E2=80=9CWe have g=
one
above and beyond. We=E2=80=99ve done thing that no global philanthropy does=
 in
terms of disclosing donors and limiting donors. But, of course, no other
foundation has quite the situation of one of the family members running
for president. So I think it will continue to be a question. Again =E2=80=
=93 you
said it =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s not necessarily the conflict. It=E2=80=99s t=
he appearance of
conflict and the GOP is just going to hammer that.
