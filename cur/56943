Dear Neighbor,

HR3
Remember when the right wing told us last year that they
were running "on the economy?" That they wanted to create
jobs, not police bedrooms
and women's bodies?

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DMIm59Z3-iguSTfIPxE8AwQ..

So much for that!

Freshman Rep. Cory Gardner of Colorado, along with his right-wing
colleagues Doug Lamborn and Mike Coffman, have sponsored legislation
in the new
Republican Congress that would actually re-define rape in federal
law--with the goal of limiting what is considered rape when a victim
needs assistance getting an abortion. This legislation has absolutely
horrified advocates for women and reproductive choice, as well as
victims of crimes. How would you like to be told you no longer qualify
for assistance as a victim of rape under federal law?

Is this disgusting, throwback idea what we sent Cory Gardner
to Congress to fight for? Click here-sign our petition demanding
that Gardner,
Coffman, and Lamborn immediately remove their names from the list of
sponsors
of H.R. 3.

A provision of the so-called "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act"
would limit the eligibility for federal assistance to cases of
"forcible rape." This change would exclude a range of circumstances,
from date rape to statutory rape of a minor child,=A0 from federal
assistance with reproductive choice. The only reason to support this
change is a desire, either affirmatively or subconsciously, to force
women in these circumstances-victims of crime-to have
their attacker's baby. (Mother Jones Magazine, 1/28/2011) It is
reprehensible!

Last fall, a case of alleged "non forcible" date rape that Weld County
DA Ken Buck refused to prosecute galvanized women in opposition to
Buck's bid for the United States Senate. Today, Cory Gardner
wants to tell that victim the rape she suffered is a lesser category
the federal government doesn't care about: at least not enough
to help her make the choices that come after.

I can tell you that this is one of the most personally
offensive proposals I have ever seen introduced in the United States
Congress,
and even knowing what I know about Gardner, Lamborn, and Coffman,
their support
for this legislation truly shocks me.

Please join me in rejecting H.R. 3, and demanding that no
Colorado representative have any part in legislation so plainly
harmful to the
interests of women everywhere.

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DurnA2iSkE1C61JRvbc8bKQ..

We will deliver your names and comments to their offices and the
press next week. Thank you for standing up to the right wing on behalf
of women and crime victims.

Sincerely,

Kjersten Forseth
