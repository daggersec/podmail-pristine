working off old draft

1) Question 1: in the But it graph, I think I would strike "to hammer out
the breakthrough that led to the Copenhagen Accord-the precursor to the
Paris Agreement--which, among other things, was" and insert "secure" So it
would read I helped secure the first international agreement...

2) question 11 Should we finally be more than skeptical about Atlantic
drilling?

3) question 13. We should put protecting oceans in someplace and question
13 seems a likely candidate. Kristina can draft something appropriate

4) question 17 should we say something about institutional racism? Has she
used language like that?
