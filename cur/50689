Good evening Cassandra and Chris-

Friday afternoon, the Defense Department requested a meeting with Senator
Daschle and General Frank McKenzie from the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They
indicated that they wanted to have an off the record discussion with Senator
Daschle about the possible transition. We don't want to get crosswise with
anything you all are doing so can you weigh in on this? My sense is they
want to meet with Tom due to his relationship to the campaign and it is
separate from other ongoing endeavors. However, we wanted to flag
this for you for your input before we respond to DOD.

Thanks much,
Jody
