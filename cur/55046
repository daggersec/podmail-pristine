John =E2=80=93 I spoke to Luke and he suggested I follow-up with you.  Just=
 to
re-cap, my five year term as head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is
up next June.  If re-nominated, I anticipate getting plenty of R support -
Grassley and Lee might be my biggest fans in the Senate - but the later we
go into the President=E2=80=99s term it may be hard for anyone to get throu=
gh.    I'd
also like to reassure my political folks here at OSC that re-nomination is
on the horizon so they don't start leaving.  Any insights into how I should
approach this would be much appreciated.  Thanks so much.
Carolyn
