> We would be happy to share our views on each of the three. In any event, =
Colorado is a caucus state and unless we begin the effort soon, we will be =
very vulnerable and could be upset. In our view, time is of the essence in =
choosing a political director.

statewide Colorado campaigns over the last thirty years including the only =
Presidential Colorado Democratic victories since Lyndon Johnson-2012, 2008,=
 and 1996.
