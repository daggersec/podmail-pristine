John --

How about Joe last night?=20

If you're as proud of him as I am, let's do what needs to be done=20
in the final push -- and let's win.

This election could come down to what happens tomorrow
morning.

My team on the campaign is about to make some of the toughest
budget decisions we've had to make. This is one of the last
chances we get to expand our ground game for the final
stretch, and what we have in the bank at midnight tonight
will decide how big we can go. And we need to go big -- so I'm=20
hoping you'll take the next step in your support right now.

Can you donate $5 or more today, and drive this campaign
forward?

I know we've asked a lot of you over the last 18 months.

I hear you.

But too much is on the line, and now is the worst possible
time to decide to hold back.

Today, I'm asking you to get on board and say you're ready
to fight alongside me and Joe.

Donate $5 or more right now:

Thank you,

Barack
