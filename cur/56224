Dear John,=20


   The new Congress is going to be a catastrophe for the environment and fo=
r those most dependent on everything from social security, safety and healt=
h protections for our food and work places, safety for our personal deposit=
s in banks and financial institutions,  and Obamacare to social programs th=
at provide some minimal protections from the worst impact of the competitiv=
e marketplace, not only the poor and the powerless, but also most of us in =
the middle class.=20

 =20

This is a spiritual and ethical crisis of highest proportions that will pla=
y out in the Congress that begins in January.=20













Every major religious community has a wide variety of injunctions to care f=
or the poor and the powerless, and to care for the earth, so this ethical a=
nd spiritual crisis is also a religious crisis.=20



Whether you are a secular humanist, militants atheist, or religious person,=
 this is a moment when we all have to realize that we have an obligation to=
 develop strategies to prevent the worst of this from actually happening.=
=20





This is not a call for money or to back some particular candidates for offi=
ce. We have to start by recognizing that the liberal and progressive forces=
, and the ethical and spiritual people in this society, have failed so far =
to sustain, build upon and expand the open-hearted, caring-for-each-other-a=
nd-caring-for the earth consciousness that was the foundation that made pos=
sible the New Deal, the Great Society legislation of the 1960s, and the env=
ironmental legislation of the 1970s.=20







Not to deny that important advances have been made, particularly in relatio=
nship to the status of women, glbtq people, and the upper middle classes of=
 minority communities, we still need to explore where we have missed the bo=
at in not having been more successful in countering the materialism, selfis=
hness, militarism and looking-out-for-number one consciousness that is foun=
dational to the present moment in American history and the willingness of l=
arge swaths of the population to either support the politicians who wish to=
 dismantle social programs to protect the environment and the needss of mid=
dle income and poor people, or at least to be passive and uninvolved as thi=
s is happening.=20







Of course we know about the disproportionate wealth and economic and media =
power by the 1% and the multinational corporations and the capitulation of =
people in both major parties to the agenda of the super-rich. But we are no=
t getting together to rehearse how unfair everything is--we know that alrea=
dy. Nor are we writing you to suggest personal repentance, but to invite yo=
u to participate in a serious rethinking and strategizing a new direction.=
=20





 Let us explain.=20

=20



 Even if Obama suddenly grew a backbone, it wouldn't be sufficient to offse=
t what the ethically-challenged extremists in Congress are planning to do b=
y refusing to fund government services. The political leadership of so much=
 of the liberal and progressive world has been unable to get together to bu=
ild a coherent alternative to the Right's ascendency. That's why ordinary p=
eople have to develop a strategy for the coming years. If you can't come to=
 this one in Northern California, can you set up a similar one in your area=
? Some of us in the Network of Spiritual Progressives might be able to part=
icipate as speakers,  either in person or on a conference call, and we migh=
t be able to help you identify some potential allies in your area ot work w=
ith you on this task. If you are interested, contact our Executive Director=
 of the Network of Spiritual Progressives, Cat Zavis:  cat@spiritualprogres=

The recently elected Congress that will shape America in the next two years=
 is committed to defunding government so that it cannot enforce the minimal=
 environmental protections currently in place, provide health care coverage=
 for those who need it,so that it, provide safety and health protection for=
 our food or for our work places, or protect the old, the young, the vulner=
able-while at the same time that Congress will seek to decrease still furth=
er the taxes on the super-rich and the corporations they own and control.=
=20







*This is an ethical, spiritual and religious crisis of monumental proportio=
ns-and calls for secular liberals and progressives to join with spiritual o=
r religious activists to work together to develop strategies to save our pl=
anet earth and protect middle income and working people and the unemployed =
from the assaults of the selfish.*=20









That's why we, spiritual progressives of every variant (including atheists =
and secular humanists as well as people in every religious community) must =
now take action to present a different worldview, one based on the Biblical=
 call to "love our neighbor" but also "love the stranger (the Other/the pow=
erless)., to pursue justice and peace. You don't have to remind us that rel=
igion has sometimes been used to justify all forms of oppression or that sp=
irituality sometimes devolves into self-indulgent flakiness. But so has dem=
ocracy and socialism sometimes been used to justify imperialism or forms of=
 totalitarianism. We've got to get well-intentioned people, both secular an=
d religious, to stop putting each other down, and instead unite so we can h=
elp Americans  re-embrace the values that once led us as a society to creat=
e institutions that embodied caring for each other and for the earth.=20



Too many people have responded to the 2014 electoral victories of the Right=
 by feeling powerless. "What can I do?" they tell themselves.  "The Rightis=
ts have the money and are filled with passionate intensity, while those who=
 seek peace and justice too often lack a coherent strategy. There are so ma=
ny groups taking on one little part of the problem or another, but mostly t=
hey don't cooperate with each other and don't even try to educate people in=
 each specific social justice or humanitarian or environmental struggle abo=
ut how they are linked to all the other struggles. So to those on the outsi=
de, it looks like everyone is just fighting for their own special interest,=
 but not for the common interests of the rest of us. I can't see how I can =
do anything, given this mess."=20









*But there is something you can do, not alone, but with a movement that we =
are creating.* The liberal and progressive forces have made some big mistak=
es-but we can change that, and we have a strategy for how to do that and ho=
w to Reclaim America. And we need you to be part of it=E2=80=93and to learn=
 from you as well, because we know we don't have all the answers!. We appro=
ach this task with humility, but also with excitement about the possibility=
 of forging a new direction, bringing together all those people who really =
yearns for a society based on love, kindness, generosity, social and econmi=
c justice, and peace. We call this goal *"the New Bottom Line."*=20









We will mourn what has happened to our country and to the planet, acknowled=
ge our own responsibility. Rather than just blame the super-rich and their =
ability to manipulate media and spend millions on candidates who serve thei=
r interests, we also need to challenge liberals and progressives to think m=
ore deeply about what changes are needed in the ways that they present them=
selves (attention office holders-you are invited to be part of this), draw =
upon the wisdom of secular humanists, religious traditions (at least the hu=
manist and love-and-caring dimensions of all the world's religious and spir=
itual communities), and spiritual-but-not-religious thinkers, and the work =
of the (interfaith and secular-humanist-welcoming) Network of Spiritual Pro=
gressives.=20



We will hear each other's ideas for how to move forward, build ties among t=
he vast array of social change organizations, progressive religious and spi=
ritual communities, and learn skills for improving our ability to have our =
most visionary ideas really taken seriously by our families, neighbors, co-=
workers, and even some of our most cynical friends. This gathering is just =
the first step in bringing this kind of discussion into the heart of everyo=
ne involved in social tansformation, into every social change organization =
and every place where ethically sensitive people gather. So if you miss thi=
s conference, but want to be involved in the ongoing work, please contact t=
he executive director of the Network of Spiritual Progressives Cat Zavis an=
d tell her what specifically you are willing to work on (but only after you=
've read our essay "Yearning for a World of Love and Justice" at http://www=
.tikkun.org/nextgen/yearning-for-a-world-of-love-and-justice [ http://www.t=
ikkun.org/nextgen/yearning-for-a-world-of-love-and-justice ] )=20



 Part of our intention is to reintroduce into public discourse the ethical =
values that could contribute to rebuilding a society based on love, care, g=
enerosity, awe and wonder. And you can play an important role by challengin=
g progressive organizations to introduce into all their activities a shared=
 vision of the world we want-not just focusing on what is wrong with the wa=
y things are now, but presenting a positive vision of the world as it needs=
 to be-a New Bottom Line of love, caring, kindness, generosity, social just=
ice, peace, environmental sanity and awe and wonder at the grandeur and pre=
ciousness of our planet earth and the universe of which we are part.=20

Undoubtedly, given the fact that it is people of color who are disproportio=
nately represented among the poorest in the society, they will be facing es=
pecially rough times, added to the violence that they face even under "norm=
al" conditions, as exemplified recently in Ferguson. In particular, in ligh=
t of the justifiable outrage at the racism manifest not just in the verdict=
 from Ferguson but also in the way most Americans don't seem to have a clue=
 about the racism involved and how pervasive it is, we encourage us all to =
see fighting racism as not just as issue for African Americans or people of=
 color, but as a priority as well for white people to  address: what is the=
 best strategy to both counter and transform that racism?  How to do that w=
ithout seeming to suggest that all whites are bad and hence to provoke back=
lash that actually makes things worse for people of color is part of the di=
scussion we hope to initiate at this conference.=20



 We invite liberals and progressives of every possible stripe to come toget=
her and strategize about how these kinds of
values can reshape public life in the US.  We ask you, the reader of this, =
to help us get leaders, activists, and members of progressive movements for=
 social and economic justice, peace, environmental sanity, civil rights, fe=
minism, lgbtq rights, immigrant rights, unions,  liberal and progressive po=
litical parties and elected officials to meet and strategize together.=20





 We need  physicians and other health practitioners,  lawyers, Silicon Vall=
ey techies, psychotherapists, working people in offices and factories and s=
killed trades, small business people, African Americans , Latinos, Asian Am=
ericans, and every other minority community,  philanthropists,  financial a=
nd investment experts, scientists, engineers, high school and college stude=
nts, teachers and academics, researchers, seniors, millennials, boomers, an=
d everyone in between who can fully commit to nonviolence and empathy as st=
rict guidelines for how to approach those with whom we disagree. Please inv=
ite your friends=E2=80=93afterwards, when they hear how exciting it was for=
 you, they'll be disappointed that you
didn't try to convince them to come!=20

We cannot afford to stay in our separate silos working on single-issue poli=
tics, or immerse ourselves in cynicism and despair about the possibility of=
 making significant change. At the very least, we need to articulate a shar=
ed vision of the world we want -not just the world we are against =E2=80=93=
 so that even as each of us continues in our focused activities to address =
specific ways that the world and its people are hurting, we simultaneously =
articulate a positive vision that we all share. We need a new unity and a n=
ew psychological and spiritual sophistication to heal and repair our very b=
roken society. Won't you join us?  =20

<p>Dear John,</p>
<p>After the 2014 elections and facing a Congress determined to dismantle e=
nvironmental protections and health and social benefits for middle income A=
mericans and the poor in 2015-2016, and after the spate of well-publicized =
police murders of African American men and grand juries refusing to indict =
the police, it&rsquo;s critical that ethically sensitive people develop a s=

<p style=3D"text-align: left;">Too many people have responded to the 2014 e=
lectoral victories of&#160;the Right &#160;by feeling powerless. &ldquo;Wha=
t can I do?&ldquo; they tell themselves. &ldquo;The Rightists have the mone=
y and are &#160;filled &#160;with passionate intensity, while those who see=
k &#160;peace and justice too often lack a coherent strat- egy.&#160; There=
 are &#160;so many groups taking on one little part of the problem or anoth=
er, but mostly they don&rsquo;t cooperate with each other and don&rsquo;t e=
ven try to educate people in each specific &#160;social justice, humanitari=
an or environmental struggle about how they are &#160;linked to all the oth=
er struggles. So to those on the outside it looks &#160;like everyone is ju=
st fight- ing for their own special interest, but not for the common intere=
sts of the rest &#160;of us. I can&rsquo;t see how I can do anything, given=
 this mess.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
But there is something you can &#160;do, not alone, but with a move- ment t=
hat we are creating.The liberal and progressive forces have made some big m=
istakes &mdash; but we can change that, and we have a strategy for how to d=
o that and how to Reclaim &#160;America. And we need you to be part of it &=
mdash; and to learn from you as well, because we know we don&rsquo;t have a=
ll the answers! We approach this task &#160;with humility, but also with ex=
citement about the possibility of forging a new direc- tion, bringing toget=
her all those people who really &#160;yearns for a society based on love, k=
indness, generosity, social and economic justice, and peace. We call this g=
oal &ldquo;the New Bottom Line.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
We will mourn what has happened to our &#160;country and to the planet, ack=
nowledge our &#160;own responsibility (rather than just blame the super-ric=
h and their ability to manipulate media and spend millions on candidates wh=
o serve their interests), challenge liberals and progressives to think more=
 deeply about what changes are &#160;needed in the ways that they present t=
hemselves (attention office holders &mdash; you are invited to be part of t=
his), &#160;draw upon the wisdom of secular humanists, religious traditions=
 (all of them), and spiritual-but-not-religious think- ers, and the work of=
 the (interfaith and secular-humanist-welcoming) Network of Spiritual Progr=
essives. We will hear each other&rsquo;s ideas for how to move forward, bui=
ld ties among the vast array of social change organizations, progressive re=
ligious and spiritual communities, and&#160;learn skills for improving our =
&#160;ability to have our &#160;most visionary ideas really &#160;taken ser=
iously by our &#160;families, neighbors, co-workers, and even some of our &=
#160;most cynical friends.<br />
<br />
Part of our intention is to reintroduce into public discourse the ethical v=
alues that could contribute to rebuilding a society based on love, care, ge=
nerosity, awe and wonder. And you can play an important role &#160;by chall=
enging progressive organizations to introduce into all their activi- ties a=
 shared vision of the world we want &mdash; not just focusing on what is wr=
ong with the way things are &#160;now, but presenting a positive vision of =
the world as it needs to be &mdash; a New Bottom Line of love, caring, kind=
- ness, generosity, social justice, peace, environmental sanity and awe&#16=
0;and wonder at the grandeur and preciousness of our &#160;planet earth and=
 the universe of which we are part.<br />
<br />
We invite liberals and progressives of every &#160;possible stripe to come =
together and strategize about how these kinds &#160;of values can reshape p=
ublic life in the US. We ask you, the reader of this, to&#160;help us &#160=
;get leaders, activists, and members of progressive movements for social an=
d economic justice, peace, environmental sanity, civil rights, feminism, lg=
btq rights, immigrant rights, unions, liberal and progressive political par=
ties and elected officials to meet and strategize together.<br />
<br />
We need physicians, lawyers, therapists, Silicon Valley techies, working pe=
ople in offices and factories and skilled trades, small business owners, Af=
rican Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and every other minority communi=
ty, philanthro- pists, financial and investment experts, scientists, engine=
ers, high school and college students, teachers and academics, researchers,=
 seniors, millennials, boomers, and everyone in between who can &#160;fully=
 commit to nonviolence and empathy&#160;as strict guidelines for &#160;how =
to approach those with whom we disagree. Please invite your &#160;friends &=
mdash; afterwards, when they hear how exciting it was for you, &#160;they&r=
squo;ll &#160;be disappointed that you didn&rsquo;t try to convince them to=
 come!<br />
<br />
We cannot afford to stay in our &#160;separate silos working on single-issu=
e politics, or immerse ourselves in cynicism and despair about the possibil=
ity of making significant change. At the very least, we need to articulate =
a shared vision of the world we want&mdash; not just the world we are again=
st&mdash; so that even as each of us &#160;continues in our &#160;focused a=
ctivities to address specific ways that the world and its people are hurtin=
g, we simultaneously articulate a positive vision that we all &#160;share.&=
#160;We need a new unity and a new psychological and spiritual sophisticati=
on to heal and repair our &#160;very broken society. Won&rsquo;t you join u=
