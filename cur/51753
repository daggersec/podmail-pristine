LCV Countdown to the Elections

Dear Friends:

With just three weeks until Election Day, LCV is ramping up our efforts in =
the most competitive races across the country. Here is the latest on our wo=
rk:

New additions to the Dirty Dozen
LCV recently announced four new additions to the 2010 Dirty Dozen. Senate c=
andidates Sharron Angle (NV), Ken Buck (CO), Ron Johnson (WI) and Christine=
 O'Donnell (DE) all vehemently oppose comprehensive clean energy and climat=
e legislation and deny the sound and settled science of global warming.

Please take a look at my latest Huffington Post article discussing the dang=
ers these "Flat Earthers" would pose if elected here.
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Dfc3YNs4eqnfQhXWIc1aXcQ..

Top races heating up
LCV and our political committees-LCV Action Fund and LCV Victory Fund-are r=
unning hard-hitting independent campaigns to help
elect pro-environment candidates in tight races across the country. In all =
of LCV's Senate priority states-Colorado, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, =
Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin -LCV-endorsed candidates are fightin=
g neck-and-neck battles that are so close that our involvement-and your sup=
port-could make the difference to the outcome in November. Please click her=
e for an overview of LCV's 2010 campaigns.
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Dl5uUSovK4eKipLKrrHPltw..

Help us reach $1 million!=20
LCV has contributed and raised over $900,000 for pro-environment
congressional candidates this cycle, already surpassing the $570,000 contri=
buted and raised during the entire 2006 midterm election cycle.

Our goal is to raise and contribute at least $1 million to our endorsed con=
gressional candidates by Election Day. Help us reach our goal by making a c=
ontribution to one or more of our stellar group of pro-environment candidat=
es through LCV Action Fund's GiveGreen program. Make your contribution onli=
ne here.=A0

Poll shows dead heat in Virginia-5=20
Last Tuesday, LCV and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU)
released a survey of likely voters in Virginia's 5th Congressional District=
 that reveals a deadlocked race between LCV-endorsed Tom Perriello and Repu=
blican challenger Robert Hurt. =A0The full polling memo is available here. =
Rep. Perriello has been a leader in the House on clean energy issues and LC=
V is doing all we can to ensure his re-election.=A0 This past weekend, LCV =
ran an all-volunteer canvass knocking on over 3,000 doors in Perriello's di=
strict.

No on Prop 23
I just returned from four days in California, where LCV's single most impor=
tant priority this election season is defeating oil industry-backed Proposi=
tion 23 on the California ballot. If passed, Prop 23 would block California=
's landmark
global warming and clean energy law and significantly delay progress on cle=
an energy jobs.

Polls show that this fight is far too close. LCV and LCV Education Fund hav=
e teamed up with our state partner, California League of Conservation Voter=
s, and LCV and LCV Education Fund have so far put $1.2 million into the fig=
ht. For more information and to get involved, click here.

As always, please visit www.lcv.org or follow us on Facebook to learn more =
about LCV's current priorities and what you can do to get involved. Thank y=
ou for all that you do for us.

Sincerely,

Gene Karpinski
LCV President
