On Brian: I would wait till he could come if need be. Tom is here till at l=
east the end of August, so it's not that long. Is it worth connecting and m=
ight you be willing to help make the connection?

On Todd Stern: where is he so I can track him down?

It's worth a run at him but I think he is committed till the end of the Adm=

Hi John:

I am hoping to get your advice and, possibly, your help on a hiring/recruit=
ment decision.  Hewlett has term limits, and the term for the head of our E=
nvironment Program is about to end.  Tom Steinbach will be leaving in Augus=
t and I need to replace him.

The position is unique in the philanthropy world.  At $100M/year for climat=
e, Hewlett is by far the largest and most significant funder, double the ne=
xt largest funder. (We also do $20M per year on western land conservation, =
and are the largest funder there too. The position oversees both portfolios=
.) We created ClimateWorks originally and spearheaded the 2.0 version on wh=
ose board you sit, and our role at the Funder Table is pivotal.  So the pos=
ition matters and I need to get the very best person.

It's a special opportunity for a couple of reasons:

(1) The overstated claims of the importance of philanthropy tend to make me=
 crazy.  Foundations aren't going to save the world, solve poverty, or elim=
inate racism.  We do good, given our resources, and that's plenty.  Climate=
 is different, though.  Here, I think the next 10-15 years really will dete=
rmine the fate of the planet in a significant way, and philanthropy really =
does have an important role. And Hewlett is the 800lb gorilla in the philan=
thropy world.  So the person with this position has an opportunity to affec=
t history and the lives of hundreds of millions (I feel sheepish writing th=
at, yet I think it's true). He or she won't be famous, but it's a unique op=
portunity to make an enormous difference for the better.

(2) The person in this position will have much more freedom than is typical=
.  Grants in our climate initiative don't require board approval, and I am =
a very hands off manager.  So the director has $100M per year to deploy wit=
h few external constraints.

But who should it be?  I would be eager to hear your thoughts, if you have =
any, about who would be right.  The person needs to see the importance of w=
hat we have been doing till now (actions to make clean fuels competitive wi=
th dirty fuels), but also to see that the next stage means going beyond thi=
s and finding a way to catalyze trillions in investments to transform infra=
structures to use the now-cost-effective clean fuels.  It's a big challenge=
.  Plus, the person needs to be able to herd the cats (other funders, grant=
ees, our staff, etc.), meaning high EQ.

One person I would love to interest is your successor at the WH:  Brian Dee=
se.  Do you think he might be interested?  I imagine he will be in high dem=
and, but I doubt there are many opportunities that are comparable in making=
 a difference.  Could you help me feel him out or see? Do you have other id=
eas?

Thanks for your time.

Best,

Larry
