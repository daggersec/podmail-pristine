 Happy new year
Spoke to jdp
My suggestion Is you both take a look
If you have a double bed you can put that in guest room sheets all yours
There are two fold up single beds there with sheets
They are heavy but two people could fold them up and move into living room =
possibly moving sectional couch against wall
There are a bunch of kitchen stuff brand new which can easily be added to l=
ots more can be used
Can use a floor lamp or table lamp or two if you have
There is a banquet seat and a dining room table but just two chairs-- likel=
y enuf but you can another one or two
You have a big closet but you can use half of my closet there as well. I wi=
ll but haven't yet bring up some clothes
Might help if you send me a list of what you have
You are on a list for keys at front desk so you should go by and scope out =
before you move
I am leaving on jan 6 and not in NYC before jan 21
Let me know if you have any questions
Have fun in Philippines
See you soon
Love
Tony
