Dear John:

Last year,  with your help, we passed historic clean energy
legislation in the U.S. House  of Representatives and through multiple
committees in the Senate. But as you  know, the job isn't done yet and
Pennsylvania could make the difference.

We still need the Senate to act swiftly to pass an even stronger
bill in 2010,  but the recent election in Massachusetts made that
harder. With a  lifetime LCV score of 100%, we firmly believe
that Senator Casey will support  clean energy jobs. We hope that
Senator Specter will make the right  choice too, but we need help to
make sure that he does.

That's why we're working with a group of dedicated
Pennsylvanians to build a  brand new organization in your state and
that's why you need to be part of  Conservation Voters of
Pennsylvania
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=lRoY91OnfLVkylkSMFTqOQ..

(CVPA).
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=fuya6o6ICKx4qGt-xBIGBQ..

LCV works hard here in Washington to make sure that our national
environment is  clean and safe, but we need a strong organization in
Pennsylvania to put the  pressure on at home. With affiliates in 33
other states, the state league  movement has proven that the LCV
program of elections, scorecards and citizen  action can make a huge
difference at the state level. Now it's time to  bring
that proven success to Pennsylvania.

This is an opportunity for you to make a significant difference
in your state.  Your input and support now will let you get in
on the ground floor
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=6xZlyNZvDGbOVumz0_wMFg..

,  and let you shape an organization that's right for you and
your state.

In 2010, Pennsylvania will elect a new Governor and the makeup
of the  legislature is poised for change. At the same time, the
state is facing  new and dangerous threats to the health and safety of
Pennsylvania's families  and natural environment. CVPA
will work with other environmental  organizations to ensure that clean
water, clean air and new clean energy jobs  are at the top of the next
Governor's agenda. 

We've made a significant investment in this new organization.
CVPA's  local founders have given their time and resources
to make this happen. The one thing missing is the most vital
ingredient: you
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=xd8zdp8MtY7MG6xefWifgA..

.
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=rkHAvI981UMko_6lVEZ7kQ..

As an LCV member, you know how important our work is and you know
what a  difference we can make. It's time to make that
difference in  Pennsylvania. 

In the next few days, you'll be hearing from the new
executive director of  Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, Josh
McNeil. Josh used to work  here in our national office and
will continue to work closely with our team.  He knows how to do
the kind of work that makes a difference. For us  to succeed
here in Washington, I am asking you to help him succeed in
Pennsylvania. 

Thank you for your continued support of our movement.

Sincerely,
Gene Karpinksi
President, League of Conservation Voters
