My guiding principle is don't over think. Do what seems interesting and rewa=

 Getting back to DC would seem to have two advantages: 1) I want to be in DC=
; and 2) I think that transitioning out of the USAF could potentially be eas=
ier from DC than either Kabul or Tacoma.  Based on what Dustin tells me abou=
t the workload I think I could even do the G'Town Tax LLM at night and not h=
ave to take myself out of the workforce for a year.  Additionally, my DC Bar=
 admission will entitle me to reciprocity with some states (e.g. VA and MD) a=
fter 5 years (Dec 2015).  So when I transition out in 2017 I'd could have ba=
r admissions other than DC without having to sit for the bar again.

ppreciated.
