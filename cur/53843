2016 promises to be a critical presidential election for veterans and =
military family members.

There's foreign policy, of course: diplomacy with Iran, our continued =
participation in Iraq, escalating involvement in Syria, and more.

And at home, some candidates are already publicly flirting with =
privatizing the VA -- a MASSIVE giveaway to the insurance companies that =
would come at the expense of the health of those who have served.

With the presidential campaign already well underway, take a moment to =
share who you support at this stage of the race, and the issues you care =
about the most.

http://action.votevets.org/straw-poll

There are a lot of candidates and even more issues that we're all are =
tracking. As we consider our involvement in the upcoming elections, it's =
important for VoteVets to learn as much as we can about your thoughts on =
each.

Happy Independence Day,

Jon Soltz
Iraq War Veteran & Chairman
