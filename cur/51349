John,

Regret not seeing you more!

This is an email I sent to Congressional Staff and others about a report I =
have been working on. I may have an inflated notion of its import or potent=
ial impact but I would appreciate your looking at the bullets below and giv=
ing me your ideas on how to promote it. I talked to the House Democratic Bu=
dget Group on Wednesday and got a very positive response. I hope it helps u=
s talk about the budget in a more effective way.

In the next few days CAP will publish a report which I am hoping you and ot=
hers in your office will find useful in discussing the current federal budg=
et impasse. Because I know there is a good chance you will be out of town w=
hen it is published I thought I would share some highlights from the report=
 in advance.


*         The choice facing the Congress is whether to cut retirement benef=
its or raise taxes. People that say they want spending cuts and refuse to l=
ook at taxes are really saying they want to cut retirement benefits.



*         Retirement programs are not only the biggest programs in the fede=
ral budget, they also account for all of the budget's growth.



*         Real per capita spending on discretionary programs (the spending =
that supports the 15 Departments and four dozen independent agencies that m=
ake up the federal government) will be lower in the coming fiscal year than=
 it was 25 years ago-the last year of the Reagan Administration. During tha=
t period, spending on these core government functions has declined dramatic=
ally as a share of gross domestic product, dropping from more than 9 percen=
t of GDP to about 7 percent next year.



*         Based on the budget caps included in the Budget Control Act two y=
ears ago, discretionary spending will decline to less than 6 percent of GDP=
 over the coming decade, lower than at any point since World War II.



*         Despite the severe restraint placed on the budgets of government =
agencies, overall government spending has increased at a fairly rapid pace-=
growing 30 percent in real per capita terms over the past quarter century. =
Three programs account for all of that growth: Social Security, Medicare an=
d Medicaid.



*         Driving the increased cost of these three big retirement programs=
 (two thirds of Medicaid benefits are paid to the elderly and disabled) has=
 been the increased number of retirees. The number of Americans 65 and olde=
r has increased by about half a million a year for most of the last 25 year=
s. That number has exploded in the last two years and the number of America=
ns over 65 will grow by a million and a half a year over the coming decades=
.



*         Despite the fact that discretionary spending is declining and non=
-retirement entitlement spending is also declining, CBO projects that feder=
al outlays will exceed 25 percent of GDP by 2030.



*         Cutting retirement benefits by the sums needed to bring outlays d=
own to the projected level of revenues under current law would require cuts=
 that would be extraordinarily painful for a large segment of the nation's =
senior citizens. Today 25 percent of Social Security beneficiaries have NO =
income other than their monthly check (which now averages $1230 a month) an=
d another 25 percent receive the majority of their income from their Social=
 Security check.



*         The necessity of savaging retirement benefits under any scenario =
that moves the federal budget substantially toward balance without addition=
al revenues has been acknowledged repeatedly by House Republicans, as they =
have passed budget resolutions that assume large savings in Medicare based =
on the enactment of the Medicare proposal put forward by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-=
WI), as well as large savings in the Medicaid payments to the states.



*         While the Ryan budgets do not reduce Social Security payments, th=
ey would dramatically increase Medicare out of pocket expenses to the elder=
ly which would have essentially the same effect. The impact of the Ryan Med=
icare proposal on a typical 65 year old retiree in 2022 was analyzed by the=
 Congressional Budget Office. CBO found that such an individual would be fo=
rced to cover 61 percent of his total medical costs out of pocket which wou=
ld amount to payments of more than $10,000 a year (in 2014 inflation adjust=
ed dollars) or $870 a month. People in that age group now pay on average $3=
50 a month in out of pocket health expenses and someone living on the avera=
ge monthly Social Security benefit would have about $900 a month left over =
to meet other expenses. Despite the fact that the average monthly benefit w=
ill rise to almost $1400 by 2022, the out of pocket expenses resulting from=
 the Ryan plan would leave a beneficiary with only a little more than $500 =
a month to meet non-medical living expenses.



*         Since the Ryan Medicare proposal fails to adjust its so-called pr=
emium support by less than the expected rate of inflation in health care co=
sts, beneficiaries will face higher out of pocket expenses each year. CBO p=
rojects that the typical younger beneficiary would be stuck paying about 68=
 percent of his or her medical costs by 2030 which would leave less than $3=
00 for other living expenses. Depending on assumptions about the pace of in=
flation for health care, monthly out of pocket medical expenses would excee=
d the average monthly Social Security check at some point between 2031 and =
2040.



*         If the United States elected to increase taxes to cover the risin=
g cost of retirement, it would remain among the lower taxed countries in th=
e developed world. According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation an=
d Development, the average percentage of GDP collected in revenues during t=
he past two decades by federal, state and local governments in the United S=
tates was less than 28 percent. That compares to a 37.3 percent average for=
 the 20 higher income developed countries.



*         The oft repeated argument that even small increases in taxes will=
 have a highly detrimental impact on economic growth is without factual fou=
ndation. Analysis by the Congressional Research Service on how changes in t=
ax law have affected economic performance in this country document that, to=
 the extent there is a correlation, it is that the United States grows slig=
htly faster in periods following tax increases and slightly slower in perio=
ds following tax cuts.



*         An examination of growth by other developed countries relative to=
 the share of GDP they collect in taxes also indicates that there is no cor=
relation between low taxes and higher rates of growth.  In fact, two of the=
 three countries collecting the highest level of taxes (ranging from nearly=
 45 percent of GDP to More than 48 percent) grew faster than any other deve=
loped countries. The three countries with the lowest taxes (Japan, the Unit=
ed States and Switzerland) all fell within the lower half of the 20 countri=
es in expansion of per capita GDP over the previous two decades. The U.S. w=
as 13th, Switzerland was 18th, and Japan was last.

Republicans are playing a very dangerous game with their demand for "entitl=
ement reform." In the 2012 elections, former Governor Mitt Romney got 56 pe=
rcent of the vote from those over 65, and in swing states like Florida and =
North Carolina it was 58 percent. Most of these elderly voters are not in t=
he "country club set" traditionally associated with Republicans. The solid =
red rural counties that run across the electoral map from southern Virginia=
 to western Oklahoma have high concentrations of low income seniors who wou=
ld be financially devastated if proposals like those being promoted by some=
 within their party to be enacted into law.
