John, the Roberts bill will be introduced on Monday night and it is now=

highly likely that a very bad "compromise" version will pass the senate=

this week and be approved by the House and on its way to the White Hous=
e
within a very short period. I can promise you that if President Obama s=
igns
this terrible legislation that blatantly validates Bernie's entire camp=
aign
message about Wall Street running our government, this will give Bernie=
 a
huge boost and 10,000 -20,000 outraged citizens ( who WILL turn up beca=
use
they will be so angry at the President for preemption vt) will be march=
ing
on the Mall with Bernie as their keynote speaker. In short, I feel cert=
ain
that Obama (who famously promised on camera to implement mandatory GMO
labeling) signing this bill will result in adding at least another mont=
h or
more of money and attention to the Sanders campaign.

To avoid this, this bill can still be stopped if the WH and Clinton
campaign come down now on the 12-14 farm state dems who Roberts will ne=
ed
to pass this compromise.

I am on a plane until 6:30 pm EST but can talk after that.  I am also
passing the same message to David Simas.

It will be terrible to hand Sanders this advantage at such a fragile ti=
me
when we really need to save our $$$ for the Trump fight. We should disc=
uss
with your team immediately.
