Let's either do a call when you are back just before the 1st (I'll be
on the West Coast) or a meeting right after the 1st.

with you to get your input, in particular on how to align myself with a thi=

 input on whether there are, and how to pursue, opportunities to do this (e=

 think tank would allow me to complete some scholarly works on the approach=

do a series of talks (mostly lined up already), and explore an entrepreneur=
