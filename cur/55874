Oh dear.  I'm so sorry.  What should I/we do?  I'm on a plane to DC or I
would call you.  They are mostly right - but see my notes below.  Any
advice on how I contain this story by not having people leak after I meet
with them?  We felt it was really important to engage this small group of
experts who have been helping us - but obviously don't want to scoop our
own plan!

In terms of what they have - let me tell you the facts and we can determine
what to do:
(1) having the proposal contemplate "Cost of attendance," not just tuition;
OUR MAIN PROPOSAL WILL FOCUS ON MAKING TUITION DEBT FREE W/NEW FEDERAL
GRANTS; STATES COMMITTING TO KEEPING COSTS DOWN; PARENTS MAKING REALISTIC
FAMILY CONTRIBUTION; AND STUDENTS WORKING 10 HOURS PER WEEK.  WE ARE, IN
FACT, CONTEMPLATING GIVING A BONUS TO STATES AND COLLEGES THAT GO FURTHER
AND MAKE "DEBT FREE COST OF ATTENDANCE" POSSIBLE FOR THE LOWEST-INCOME
STUDENTS.  SO....WHAT THEY HAVE IS TRUE, BUT WE WON'T GO AS FAR AS THEY ARE
HEARING.

(2) a college student's "bill of rights"; YES - THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
OBAMA DID AND WE ARE BUILDING ON IT - PROBABLY GOOD TO HAVE FLOATED

and (3) a responsibility provision that would make colleges bear some of
the liability for students who default on their obligations. YES - THIS IS
A LAMAR ALEXANDER IDEA THAT WARREN ENDORSED TODAY AND WE ARE CONTEMPLATING

ile she says that every student should have a &quot;debt free option&quot; =
to attend college, her policy proposals to get there are first directed at =
the states: (1) states should invest more in higher ed; and (2) states shou=
