Dear Subscriber,=0AWe are pleased to invite you to join us on Thursday, Oct=
ober 2 (11am PT / 2pm ET / 18:00 GMT) for the season's first Talking  ( htt=
p://www.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s12f8fhpfA5J )Biopolitics, ( http://ww=
w.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s12d0fhpfA5L ) a series of live web-based co=
nversations with cutting-edge thinkers about the social meaning of human bi=
otechnologies.=0A( http://www.geneticsandsociety.rsvp1.com/s1e40ehpfA5P )=
=0A( http://womensstudies.berkeley.rsvp1.com/s1270fhpfA5T ) Charis Thompson=
 ( http://womensstudies.berkeley.rsvp1.com/s1e38ehpfA5Z ), Chancellor's Pro=

ey.rsvp1.com/s1c30fhpfA6d ), Professor in Bioethics and Society in the Depa=
rtment of Environmental Science, Policy and Management at Berkeley &ndash; =
and with you &ndash; about her new book, Good Science: The Ethical Choreogr=
aphy of Stem Cell Research ( http://mitpress.mit.rsvp1.com/s1050ehpfA6l ).=
=0AThompson's book makes a convincing case that good science depends upon g=
ood ethics, and provides a map for the kinds of choreography that are neede=
d to get there.=0AShe raises valuable and timely questions: How has the con=
troversy over human pluripotent stem cell research evolved over the past fi=
fteen years? What political, ethical, and scientific developments have emer=
ged, and how have they shifted the conversation about biopolitics today?=0A=
Highlighting an emergent framing of innovation that she terms "procurial," =
Thompson examines concerns about a pro-cures mandate and a range of bio-cur=
atorial practice. She shows how "ethical choreography" has allowed biomedic=
al research to continue throughout controversy, and what may be possible mo=
ving forward.=0ABroadening the biopolitical paradigm, she addresses the rel=
evance of health disparities, disability justice, and militarization, as we=
ll as the complexities of animal and human research subjecthood that she ha=
s seen in stem cell research.=0AAbout the Author=0ACharis Thompson ( http:/=
