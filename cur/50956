John --

You may never get another chance like this one.

If you chip in $5 or whatever you can to build this
campaign, you'll be automatically entered to meet President
Barack Obama and President Bill Clinton in California:

https://donate.barackobama.com/Two-Presidents

I know it sounds almost too good to be true. Trust me, this
is happening -- in fact, it's happening next week -- and
you could be there.=20

You've stood with President Obama. You deserve this.=20
There's just one more step to take.

Enter now, and if you're selected, not only will we fly you
and a guest out to sunny California, but you'll meet two
great American presidents. This is something you'll
remember for the rest of your life ... and seriously, when
will an opportunity like this come up again?

https://donate.barackobama.com/Two-Presidents

Good luck!

Julianna
