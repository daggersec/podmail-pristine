I think it will be a headache. Eventually we have to face the need for
updated AUMF with flexibility and oversight, but no idea how to get there
in a smart and effective way, especially in the current environment. may
want to drop it here so we can give it more in-depth focus later rather
than opening a can of worms with no plan.

<h3><span>4. Reinforce
reliable and capable partners in the region </span></h3>

uot;">The United States
should reinforce key regional partners such as Jordan, which is already cop=
ing
with the challenges of the Syrian civil war and its attendant refugee outfl=
ow.
Additional security and intelligence coordination and operations with Jorda=
n,
Turkey, and the Kurdistan Regional Government are essential, along with
humanitarian assistance to help care for those displaced by the crisis. The=
se
partners have intelligence and capabilities that we should leverage to degr=
ade
the threat from ISIS. They should also be early beneficiaries of additional
resources from the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund proposed by President
Obama at West Point last month to bolster regional partner efforts to comba=
t
terrorism.<a href=3D"#146a97dcdef0ce7a_146a6a4b31ff0282__edn7" name=3D"146a=
97dcdef0ce7a_146a6a4b31ff0282__ednref7" title=3D""><span>[xiv]</span></a> A=
ny effort to degrade and defeat
ISIS as a security threat and a political and ideological force will requir=
e a
comprehensive counter-radicalization strategy to blunt the growing popular
appeal of radical Islam, including the surge in Salafi jihadism throughout =
the
region. The United States should focus assistance on regional partners that=
 are
willing to undertake reform efforts that can build more inclusive societies=
 and
that will undermine the ideology of extremists over time.</span></p>

<h3><span>5. Prepare for
limited counterterrorism operations against ISIS, including possible air
strikes </span></h3>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"line-height:150%"><span style=3D"font-size:=
12pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&q=
uot;">It is clear that ISIS
poses an immediate threat to Iraq and a possible terrorist threat to the Un=
ited
States and its allies. In Iraq, the United States should prepare for limite=
d
use of U.S.&mdash;and if possible allied&mdash;air power on ISIS targets to=
<b> </b>degrade
their ability to further destabilize the country and to protect U.S. intere=
sts,<b>
</b>including the protection of thousands of American citizens working for =
the
United States inside Iraq. Strikes need to be rooted in good intelligence o=
n
the ground and will require prepositioning of some additional military asse=
ts
in the region, including armed drones and personnel to advise the Iraqi
government. Their utility will be in helping to slow the advance of ISIS an=
d
providing some time and space for Iraqis to regroup, but they will not on t=
heir
own turn the tide. This kind of support is similar to what the U.S. Air For=
ce
did with regional allies throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s conducting
Operation Northern Watch to ensure the Kurds could operate free of advancin=
g
threats by Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s forces.<a href=3D"#146a97dcdef0ce7a_146a6=
a4b31ff0282__edn8" name=3D"146a97dcdef0ce7a_146a6a4b31ff0282__ednref8" titl=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"line-height:150%"><span style=3D"font-size:=
12pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&q=
uot;">Action against ISIS in
Iraq alone will likely push the problem back across the border into Syria,
where ISIS controls large swaths of ungoverned territory. This possibility
requires more robust efforts to<b> </b>train and equip the moderate Syrian
opposition forces that have shown a willingness and ability to fight ISIS a=
nd
Assad, something CAP has called for previously.<a href=3D"#146a97dcdef0ce7a=
_146a6a4b31ff0282__edn9" name=3D"146a97dcdef0ce7a_146a6a4b31ff0282__ednref9=
" title=3D""><span>[xvi]</span></a>
The administration and Congress should make this the first test of Presiden=
t
Obama&rsquo;s Counterterrorism Partnership Fund, using resources already de=
dicated to
Overseas Contingency Operations. Details about vetting, the location for
training, and the types of equipment necessary should be worked out rapidly=
. </span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"line-height:150%"><span style=3D"font-size:=
12pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&q=
uot;">In the event that ISIS
comes to pose a credible and direct threat to the United States, we should =
be
prepared to undertake limited air strikes against ISIS targets inside
Syria.&nbsp; This would be similar to the air strikes undertaken against Al
Qaeda and its affiliates in ungoverned spaces elsewhere in the world.&nbsp;=
Any
strikes against ISIS in Syria would need to be driven by clear, actionable
intelligence against a target that poses such a credible and direct threat.
Given that ISIS has been joined by several hundred European and even some U=
.S.
passport holders, preparations to this end should be taken now.&nbsp;As alw=
ays,
the president retains the authority to respond in self-defense to an immine=
nt
threat to the United States.&nbsp;While the threat to the United States doe=
s
not yet appear to be imminent, the evolution of ISIS in Iraq and Syria may =
well
require the United States to update the legal framework developed after the
September 11<sup>th</sup> attacks to ensure any president has the authority=
 to
combat terrorist groups that threaten America with proper oversight from
congress and accountability to the American public.</span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal" style=3D"line-height:150%"><span style=3D"font-size:=
12pt;line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&q=
uot;">The Iraq War itself and
its poor execution destabilized the region and facilitated greater Sunni-Sh=
ia
conflict within Iraq. The United States should not undertake military actio=
n
lightly and should be wary of unintended consequences. But not all military
action is the same. Ground troops or invasions to control a country are ver=
y
different from limited air strikes or targeted assistance to help push back
terrorist extremists. Extremist terrorist groups controlling large swaths o=
f
territory in Iraq and Syria from which they could ultimately attack America=
n
interests or allies are worthy of a limited, effective response, including
limited air strikes.&nbsp; </span></p>
