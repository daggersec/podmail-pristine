Jason has been an energy advisor to Barack going back into his Senate
work.  He's done a lot of good work for us and run interference at times
with the environmental community.  That said, I don't see a need to
cater to him in the transition process.  Carol should decide how he
would be used in the transition, but I'd expect he'd be in the mix for a
decent position in an administration.

=20

That's my perspective, but you should also check with Heather
Higginbottom.

Don:=20

I have been reaching out to all of the folks who have been approved for
my agency teams.=20

In connection with that exercise, I spoke today with Jason Grumet.  As
you know, I had not put Jason on my agency lists, on the assumption that
he would be part of a central policy effort.  I received word back,
however, that we should ask him to co-chair the DOE team.  I called
Jason to ask him if he would be able to take this on, and to review the
makeup of the team that we have assembled for DOE, as well as the other
teams in the energy and natural resources cluster, since he has worked
with many of these folks over the past 18 months.   =20

We had a good conversation (Jason is a friend), but Jason made it clear
that he is not happy with the proposed assignment.  He asked about
whether there would be some sort of central policy team in the
post-election transition, and when I answered in the affirmative, he
questioned why he wouldn't be on that, since he's been working across
this broad issue area throughout the campaign.  He was very pleasant
about it, but he expressed surprise and some irritation that he would be
asked to oversee a single agency -- DOE.   =20

I assured Jason that there certainly was no slight intended, that the
work of the agency teams is crucial, etc., etc.  I gave him some
background about the quality and depth of the work that the agency teams
already have been doing.

But Jason wasn't buying what I was selling.  He was focused on the fact
that there is and will continue to be a central policy apparatus, and he
didn't understand why that isn't where he should be slotting in.

So we have an issue to deal with.  That's why I am copying Carol and
John with this email. =20

I personally think that we should go back to my original suggestion and
put Jason on the central policy team.  It is a bit odd to have Jason,
who has been Barack's primary energy and environmental advisor and the
lead for all of the policy groups in the energy and environmental space,
to be heading up the agency team for a single agency.  I had received
word back from Lisa that Heather Zichal -- whom I also had recommended
for some overarching role -- is destined for the central policy group.
That's the right thing for her, too. =20

Thanks. =20

-- David=20

P.S.  I think that it's important that we close on this issue ASAP.  It
is not good to have Jason brooding about this. =20
