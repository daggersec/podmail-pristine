John -- we need an answer on ethanol and the RFS before she gets to Iowa.
Our options are below.  What do you think?  Perhaps she could go between 1
and 2 and say, I support ethanol and the RFS but I'm prepared to look at
how to make it maximally effective.

*1. Status Quo*

Under this approach, maintain her 2008 support for biofuels in general and
the RFS in particular, argue that EPA has the flexibility it needs under
EISA to make adjustments to the program based on changing market
conditions, and call for an expansion of E85 supply to help address the
blend wall issue.  This is broadly in line with the Obama Administration=E2=
=80=99s
current posture on the issue.

Supporting the RFS as it currently exists would certainly garner support in
Midwest states and Iowa in particular. In our view, while many
environmental, consumer, and aid groups would be mildly disappointed (as
would the oil and gas industry) few would see it as a surprise or make it a
significant campaign issue.
*2. Reform*

Highlight the changes in our domestic energy situation since EISA was
passed in 2007 (and since you supported the RFS during the 2008 campaign)
and promise to reform the RFS to make it a more effective tool in meeting
our current challenges. Still speak positively about the potential climate
and security benefits of biofuels, but that the policy as it exists today
is not achieving that potential. Highlight the need to reform the RFS so
that it effectively drives investment to the cleanest and most sustainable
types of biofuels production and lets the market identify the most valuable
biofuels uses, rather than having the EPA specify.

This approach would mark a significant departure from her 2008 position and
that of the Obama administration, and thus would likely receive
considerable primary attention. Consumer and aid groups would applaud the
move, and the oil and gas industry would welcome it. Most environmental
organizations would welcome it as well, provided it shifted the policy=E2=
=80=99s
focus from conventional to advanced biofuels. This approach, however, would
be strongly opposed by existing biofuel interests and corn growers heavily
concentrated in Iowa and other Midwest states.
*3. Repeal*

The third option is to call for the outright repeal of the RFS. This would
push further than any Democrats in the Senate, as well as most Republicans.
Consumer groups would no doubt welcome this move, as would oil and gas
companies and producing states, but the environmental community would
likely be split. Many environmental groups see the RFS as a critical
instrument in driving biodiesel and other advanced biofuels production.
Such a position would be surprising and clearly differentiated from other
Democrats (Appendix II), the Obama administration, and a number of likely
or announced Republican presidential contenders (Appendix III).

Corn growers and corn ethanol producers would obviously be the most opposed
to this option, as would advanced biofuels producers that would likely be
supportive or neutral of option 2. Given widespread support for at least a
reformed RFS in Congress, getting repeal legislation passed would be
challenging.
