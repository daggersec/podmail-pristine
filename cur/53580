Dear Friend,

Suthers Payday Lending
Last week, nonpartisan watchdog group Colorado Ethics Watch called on
Attorney General John Suthers to immediately give back a sudden burst
of donations he received from the payday lending
industry-donations received at the same time his office is
drafting new rules restricting predatory payday lending in Colorado.
What's worse, a legislative staffer has asserted that the new rules
are not as strict as the law requires! The obvious conflict of
interest this represents is very serious.

Click below to demand Suthers immediately return the thousands he
recently received from payday lenders:

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3DPNTcd8wSOJNnV6HWiXBNhg..

As the state's highest law enforcement officer, Suthers has the
strictest obligation to remain free of conflicts of interest.
According to the Grand Junction Sentinel last week, with further
reporting by the Durango Herald, Suthers received over $10,000 from
PACs and donors associated with the payday lending industry in recent
weeks. Prior to this, Suthers had never received significant
contributions from the payday lending industry (Grand Junction
Sentinel, 8/14/2010).

At the same time Suthers' re-election campaign accepted these
donations, Suthers' office was drafting new rules governing the
predatory payday lending industry, as mandated by the Colorado
legislature's passage this year of tough reforms to protect
consumers, and limit the exorbitant interest charged by these lenders.
Limits on payday lending had been sought for many years unsuccessfully
by ProgressNow Colorado and a broad coalition of consumer advocacy
organizations.

After everything we have fought for to reform predatory payday
lending, is Attorney General Suthers stabbing Colorado consumers in
the back? John Suthers opposed House Bill 1351, and has continued to
disparage the legislation as a defense against questions about his
office's handling of the proposed new rules. But according to a
legislative staffer interviewed by the Sentinel, Suthers'
proposed rules are not as strict on payday lenders as the law signed
by the Governor.

We can't allow dirty payday loan money to influence the judgment
of our highest elected officials. Sign our petition-demand that
Suthers immediately return these donations from the payday loan
industry.

http://progressnowcolorado.pnstate.org/site/R?i=3D1TIK6BV5JjAexNxGcI2aew..

Under the old rules, payday lenders made $75 to loan $500 for two
weeks or less. That means the payday lenders had to exploit nearly 140
Coloradans to give Suthers his $10,000. That's reason enough for
Suthers to be ashamed, but to take this money while weakening the new
protections that ProgressNow Colorado members, and concerned citizens
around the state fought for year after year, would be totally
unacceptable.

Don't let Suthers get away with it.

And thanks for standing up for integrity in Colorado's highest
public officials.

Sincerely,
Kjersten Forseth
ProgressNow Colorado
