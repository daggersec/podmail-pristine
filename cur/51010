spending to afford gas. McCain's thermometer ratings from both Democrats and
Republicans dropped significantly in the
Hotline/Diageo<http://www.nationaljournal.com/hotline/hl_20080509_3408.php>survey

dropping with Democrats only. Also see States - General Election for latest

   - The program's "clearest focus" is politics, especially Beltway politics
   which accounted for nearly 47 percent of its air time. "Overall, "The Daily
   Show" news agenda is quite close to those of cable news talk shows," Pew
   said.
   - Stewart's skewering of the press takes up about 8 percent of the
   program.
   - The show focused its satire on Republicans three times as often as
   Democrats during the period of July 1 through November 1.
   - The show avoids, for obvious reasons, major events covered by the
   conventional media when they have to do with tragedies like the Minneapolis
   Bridge Collapse or Virginia Tech shootings.
