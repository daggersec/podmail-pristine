This past year, those issues have come to the fore at campuses across the c=

Dear Knox Community,

=20

As so many of you are away from campus, I wanted to report to you on an ope=
n forum we held this past Wednesday to discuss concerns about events relate=
d to the grand jury decision in Ferguson, MO, including a student=E2=80=99s=
 recent protest; the current climate at Knox; and our commitment to a more =
inclusive future for our campus.=20

=20

On Wednesday, approximately 100 faculty, staff and students shared their th=
oughts; it was an enlightening and emotional discussion that brought many n=
ational issues into a local and, sometimes, personal context. Many of those=
 present at the forum affirmed their admiration and support for the courage=
 of the Knox basketball player who protested the Ferguson decision at a bas=
ketball game in Clayton, Missouri. I regret that the College=E2=80=99s init=
ial response to the protest caused any members of the Knox community, espec=
ially the student, to doubt our historic commitment to individual acts of c=
onscience and freedom of speech, and I vow to do better in the future. The =
College is committed to supporting our students as they engage with and lea=
d conversations on the pressing moral concerns of our time.=20

=20

As a community, we cannot underestimate the effect that these national issu=
es have on us all as individuals, and we must respect one another as we res=
pond to these events according to the dictates of their own consciences. I =
have learned that addressing climate issues on campus deserves more of my f=
ocus, and I am committed to ensuring that all faculty, staff, and students =
put in the time and work necessary to strengthen our community.

=20

Many speakers at the forum described their perceptions and experiences of r=
acial insensitivity at Knox. Among the examples cited were the continuing p=
resence of the Siwash name and paraphernalia, the seeming invisibility at K=
nox of the important issues raised by the events in Ferguson and other citi=
es, and the desire for more opportunities for engagement with issues of div=
ersity and inclusivity. I regret any instances of disrespect and hurt that =
some in our community have experienced, and pledge fully to investigate all=
 reports of insensitivity and discrimination. At the forum, and in the Knox=
 2018 strategic plan, I also pledged an expanded College commitment to educ=
ation, training, and respect, so that every student at Knox has equal acces=
s to a transformational educational experience.=20

=20

I believe there is no better place than a college campus for open dialogue =
and respectful consideration of a wide spectrum of views. Knox is especiall=
y suited for such conversations, as we are rich in the number of diverse pe=
rspectives. This week=E2=80=99s open forum was just one more small step for=
ward, and I understand that many more small and large steps are necessary t=
o meet the needs and expectations of our campus community.=20

=20

Some steps include a workshop held this past August attended by a quarter o=
f the faculty addressing how to build an inclusive classroom. Even before t=
he Ferguson decision, faculty and staff began thinking of how best to addre=
ss those issues once classes were again in session, potentially utilizing t=
he occasion of the week of the MLK convocation. And the Knox community gath=
ered a second time this week to discuss the Staten Island grand jury decisi=
on, while faculty have come together this December to read and discuss Whis=
tling Vivaldi, which explores the influence of stereotypes on campuses. Int=
ergroup Dialogue will continue and, in addition, we are committed to identi=
fying new ways to better understand and value each other and to encourage o=
pen dialogue on important and timely societal issues. Plans are also underw=
ay for  additional workshops on diversity and inclusivity for faculty and s=
taff, and we will work with the Campus Diversity Committee, Student Senate,=
 and faculty, staff and students who have expertise on these matters as we =
move forward. As always, I welcome feedback and input from the campus commu=
nity on additional ways we can address the concerns brought to my attention=
 over my time on campus and especially over the past week.

=20

This is a momentous time for us, one in which the core Knox values of criti=
cal thinking and engagement are on display and tested. It provides us with =
the opportunity to take a deeper look at who we are and who we want to be a=
s individuals and as a community. This conversation will continue both onli=
ne and face-to-face, and I encourage you to take advantage of the opportuni=
ty to engage in those conversations openly and respectfully. I very much lo=
ok forward to the return of our students in January so that these conversat=
ions, sharing of perspectives, and community growth can continue.

Sincerely,

=20

concerns about events related to the grand jury decision in Ferguson, MO, i=

"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>On Wednesday, approximately 100 faculty, st=
aff and students shared their thoughts; it was an enlightening and emotiona=
l discussion that brought many national issues into a local and, sometimes,=
 personal context. Many of those present at the forum affirmed their admira=
tion and support for the courage of the Knox basketball player who proteste=
d the Ferguson decision at a basketball game in Clayton, Missouri. I regret=
 that the College=E2=80=99s initial response to the protest caused any memb=
ers of the Knox community, especially the student, to doubt our historic co=
mmitment to individual acts of conscience and freedom of speech, and I vow =
to do better in the future. The College is committed to supporting our stud=
ents as they engage with and lead conversations on the pressing moral conce=
rns of our time. </span><span style=3D'font-family:"Georgia",serif'><o:p></=

ty, we cannot underestimate the effect that these national issues have on u=
s all as individuals, and we must respect one another as we respond to thes=
e events according to the dictates of their own consciences. I have learned=
 that addressing climate issues on campus deserves more of my focus, and I =
am committed to ensuring that all faculty, staff, and students put in the t=
ime and work necessary to strengthen our community.</span><span style=3D'fo=

s and experiences of racial insensitivity at Knox. Among the examples cited=
 were the continuing presence of the Siwash name and paraphernalia, the see=
ming invisibility at Knox of the important issues raised by the events in F=
erguson and other cities, and the desire for more opportunities for engagem=
ent with issues of diversity and inclusivity. I regret any instances of dis=
respect and hurt that some in our community have experienced, and pledge fu=
lly to investigate all reports of insensitivity and discrimination. At the =
forum, and in the Knox 2018 strategic plan, I also pledged an expanded Coll=
ege commitment to education, training, and respect, so that <u>every</u> st=
udent at Knox has equal access to a transformational educational experience=
. </span><span style=3D'font-family:"Georgia",serif'><o:p></o:p></span></p>=

r place than a college campus for open dialogue and respectful consideratio=
n of a wide spectrum of views. Knox is especially suited for such conversat=
ions, as we are rich in the number of diverse perspectives. This week=E2=80=
=99s open forum was just one more small step forward, and I understand that=
 many more small and large steps are necessary to meet the needs and expect=
ations of our campus community. </span><span style=3D'font-family:"Georgia"=

k'>Some steps include a workshop held this past August attended by a quarte=
r of the faculty addressing how to build an inclusive classroom. Even befor=
e the Ferguson decision, faculty and staff began thinking of how best to ad=
dress those issues once classes were again in session, potentially utilizin=
g the occasion of the week of the MLK convocation. And the Knox community g=
athered a second time this week to discuss the Staten Island grand jury dec=
ision, while faculty have come together this December to read and discuss <=
i>Whistling Vivaldi</i>, which explores the influence of stereotypes on cam=
puses. Intergroup Dialogue will continue and, in addition, we are committed=
 to identifying new ways to better understand and value each other and to e=
ncourage open dialogue on important and timely societal issues. Plans are a=
lso underway for &nbsp;additional workshops on diversity and inclusivity fo=
r faculty and staff, and we will work with the Campus Diversity Committee, =
Student Senate, and faculty, staff and students who have expertise on these=
 matters as we move forward. As always, I welcome feedback and input from t=
he campus community on additional ways we can address the concerns brought =
to my attention over my time on campus and especially over the past week.</=
