Mike and Co. --

We've had a couple of news cycles since Sen. Sanders released the details of=
 his=20
health care and tax plan.  One surprise is the sheer scale of the proposal -=
- it calls for $14 trillion in new taxes and spending in the next decade. =20=


The plan's size might be obscuring two other big but unremarked upon surpris=
es: most of the new taxes Sanders proposes to pay for his plan are regressiv=
e and the tax increases called for are all on individuals, none on corporati=
ons.  Details below.

Best,

Dana
=20
---------

The Proposal=20
=20
In his recently unveiled health care plan, Sen. Sanders proposes a single-pa=
yer health care system to replace the Affordable Care Act.  It would be fund=
ed by major changes to the individual tax code, featuring a top rate on inco=
me of 52 percent for those earning over $10 million.  The rate on those earn=
ing $250,000 would increase from 33 to 37 percent; those earning $500,000 wo=
uld see their top rates go from 39.6 to 43 percent.=20

The plan does away with the preferential treatment long afforded capital gai=
ns and dividends, meaning they would be taxed at the same rates as ordinary i=
ncome for taxpayers earning over $250,000.  Under current law, the top rate o=
n such income is 23.8 percent; a taxpayer who sells a business for $5 millio=
n of gain would pay $1.19 million in federal tax under current law, but woul=
d pay $2.4 million in federal tax under the plan (a rate of 48 percent).

The plan would also limit the benefit of all itemized deductions to a 28 per=
cent rate, meaning a taxpayer who earned $500,000, and was thus in Sanders=E2=
=80=99 43 percent bracket would effectively pay a 15 percent tax on deductio=
ns such as mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and charitable contribu=
tions.
=20
New and Rising Taxes

Sen. Sanders proposes a broad range of tax increases would be the largest ev=
er enacted to fund his healthcare initiative over the next decade. The multi=
faceted plan includes the following major provisions:

=E2=80=A2  Payroll Tax -- a 6.2 percent payroll tax, which the Sanders campa=
ign calls an =E2=80=9Cincome-based health care premium paid by employers.=E2=
=80=9D  Revenue: $630 billion per year.=20
=20
=E2=80=A2  "Income Tax Premium" -- a 2.2 percent income tax premium, spread a=
cross all income tax brackets.  Revenue: $210 billion per year.

 =E2=80=A2  New Brackets -- Raised tax rates on the income above $250,000 vi=
a new tax brackets.  These income taxes would be the highest since the begin=
ning of Reagan=E2=80=99s first term.  Revenue: $110 billion per year.
1. 37 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000.=20
2. 43 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million.=20
3. 48 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million.=20
4. 52 percent on income above $10 million.
=20
=E2=80=A2  Capital Gains --  Taxing capital gains and dividends as regular i=
ncome.  Revenue: $91 billion per year.

=E2=80=A2  Limiting tax deductions =E2=80=93 The Senator seems to be proposi=
ng a hard limit on tax deductions for earners over $250,000; more informatio=
n is necessary regarding specifically how this will occur.  Revenue: $15 bil=
lion per year

=E2=80=A2  Estate Tax -- raises estate tax rates and lowering the estate tax=
 limit to $3.5 million.  (NB:  The Senator is expected to propose a bracket s=
ystem for estate taxes based on size, but has not described those brackets).=
  Revenue: $21 billion per year.
=20
The remaining revenue is said to come from the projected $310 billion per ye=
ar in savings from health-care related tax credits and exemptions.  A number=
 of commenters, including health care experts, have said that this estimate i=
s exceedingly optimistic.
=20
Paradox of the Plan:  Oddly Regressive
=20
The massive bill for the Sanders health care plan is twice the size of the d=
efense budget, it is larger than all discretionary spending, and it is meant=
 paid for by the unprecedented tax increases outlined above.  They amount to=
 $1.38 trillion annually in new taxes.   A $1.4 trillion tax hike on a $4 tr=
illion base is tremendous.  It would easily be the largest tax increase in h=
istory, to pay for healthcare, which was recently overhauled by a Democratic=
 president. =20
=20
So where does all that tax money come from?   All of it comes from individua=
ls --there is no mention of corporations paying anybody.  Close to half of i=
t comes from a 6.2 percent addition to the payroll tax on employers called a=
n =E2=80=9Cincome-based health care premium=E2=80=9D (which would likely be p=
assed on to workers).  The impact on hiring aside, a payroll tax is a regres=
sive tax.  In effect, the new $60 billion tax is a transfer of the tax burde=
n from wealthy to middle-class taxpayers. =20
=20
Sen. Sanders plan adds a 2.2 percent income-based tax on most households tha=
t would cost taxpayers $210 billion a year -- another levy, it appears from t=
he proposal, to be regressive, landing squarely on wage-earners rather than e=
mployers. =20
=20
In exchange for tax hikes, the government would finance generous health care=
 coverage without deductibles and copays. He argues that a "typical middle-c=
lass family" would save more than $5,000 per year, and employers would save o=
ver $9,400 per worker annually.=20

Additionally, some observers consulted agreed that the new details in the pl=
an show that certain populations who may have been covered by Obamacare coul=
d wind up paying more in this system.  For example, low-income workers with M=
edicaid coverage could end up paying more under the proposed 6.2 percent emp=
loyer payroll tax.  That amount would be higher than what Medicaid enrollees=
 pay out of pocket for care. Low-income workers insured through their employ=
ers could benefit because that 6.2 percent tax may be lower than what they p=
ay in premiums.=20

Dubious Viability=20

When Sen. Michael Bennet sought a cloture vote on the public option during S=
enate floor consideration of the ACA in 2010, he was 10 Senators shy of the 5=
0 needed to even do that -- despite the significant Democratic majority.  To=
day, the policy would assuredly be more difficult to pass, with Congress lik=
ely to remain in GOP hands.
=20
While Sanders=E2=80=99 plan=E2=80=99s dubious viability is a noteworthy fail=
ure, the sheer volume of taxes the Senator proposes to levy against the low-=
 and middle-income families he claims to be fighting for. =20

While the headline grabbing aspect of the new income tax brackets on the wea=
lthy is sure to drive the most commentary, the bulk of this plan is meant to=
 be paid for by the income tax premium and new payroll tax =E2=80=93 both of=
 these taxes are particularly regressive. =20

All of this in order to replace a health care reform law that was hard-won, e=
ven during a Democrat majority, and has had to be vigorously defended since t=
he very first day of its passage.  Voters may wonder how debating replacing t=
he ACA and enacting the largest tax increase in history is meant to help the=
m.  Said Vice President Biden today:  "We need a more progressive tax code -=
- not confiscatory policy. Not socialism.  A tax code."
