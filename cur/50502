Click here to insist that Congress pass substantial campaign finance =
reforms to keep dark money out of our democracy >>

Billionaires like the Koch brothers have taken full advantage of the =
Citizens United decision. Just last year outside groups spent almost $500 =
million to buy elections. This is outrageous and it has to stop.

Will you sign your name to STOP Citizens United?
Sign your name >>

http://action.kirkpatrickforarizona.com/page/s/end-citizens-united
Our democracy is not for sale.

But five years ago, Citizens United paved the way for billionaires to =
spend unlimited amounts of cash to buy elections.

And John, no one's been more relentless in using Citizens United than the =
Koch brothers.

Elections are about making sure the voters are heard, not about =
billionaires buying a vote in Congress.

That's why I'm demanding Congress pass meaningful campaign finance reform. =
Will you add your support for Koch-free elections?
