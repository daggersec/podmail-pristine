John --

Elena Kagan is making the rounds on Capitol Hill today. As senators start =
to get to know the President's Supreme Court nominee, I wanted to make =
sure you had a chance to do the same.

If you haven't already, take a moment to watch President Obama introduce =
her to the nation:

Thanks,

From: Barack Obama
Subject: Elena Kagan

Friend --

Today, it is my great honor to nominate our Solicitor General, and my =
friend, Elena Kagan, to be the next justice of the United States Supreme =
Court.

As I send my nomination to the Senate, I wanted to record a special =
message for you that I hope will help us launch a national discussion.

Take a minute to watch this video, and then help me to introduce Elena to =
your friends and family by passing it on:

http://my.barackobama.com/ElenaKagan8

Elena is widely regarded as one of the best legal minds of her generation =
-- earning praise from across the ideological spectrum throughout her =
career. Above all, she is a trailblazer. She wasn't just the first woman =
to serve as dean of Harvard Law School -- she was one of its most beloved =
and successful leaders, building a reputation for openness to other =
viewpoints and skill in working with others to build consensus. These were =
some of the many reasons why I selected her to be my Solicitor General, =
the nation's chief advocate -- the first woman to hold that post as well.

Her work as Solicitor General has allowed me to see firsthand just why =
Elena is particularly well-suited to the Court: She has not only a keen =
understanding of the law, but also one that is rooted in a deep awareness =
of its impact on people's lives. Last year, she made that clear -- =
choosing the Citizens United case as her first to argue before the Supreme =
Court, defending bipartisan campaign finance reform against special =
interests seeking to spend unlimited money to influence our elections.

Now, I look forward to the prospect of Elena taking her seat alongside =
Justice Ginsberg and Justice Sotomayor. For the first time, our nation's =
highest court would include three women, ensuring a Court that would be =
more inclusive, more representative, more reflective of us as a people =
than ever before.

When Justice Stevens wrote me to announce his retirement, I knew that the =
Court would be losing a standard bearer. And I felt a responsibility to =
nominate an individual capable of being that same guiding force, a =
consistent voice of reason on the Court.

I am certain I have made the right choice. As you learn more about Elena, =
I am confident you'll see what I do -- that she is a voice we need on the =
Supreme Court.

Please watch the message -- and share it with others:

http://my.barackobama.com/ElenaKagan8

Thank you,

President Barack Obama
