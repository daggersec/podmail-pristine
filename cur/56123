Dear colleagues, those of you who've known me for many years, know that at =
=20
this time of year, in my spiritual tradition, it is our custom to ask =20
forgiveness of those we have hurt. I invite anyone who wants to take this  =
up=20
with me personally, to please email me so we can resolve any =20
misunderstandings, disagreements, hurt and work out a productive peace for =
us  all.
=20
Please forgive me if,  in my terror and passion to protect our brothers and=
=20
sisters, if I have  been unkind to you, about what I consider to be two=20
potentially  dangerous changes to the way we live, if not corrected. I beli=
eve=20
these  changes, if not remedied with appropriate safeguards and legal=20
protections in  writing, to the health care and long-term service of suppor=
ts for=20
seniors  and people with disabilities and our caregivers, could mean grave=
=20
consequences  for us. And I am also afraid that people will be uninformed=
=20
about important  decisions it is their right to make.
=20
I feel we are in a  David and Goliath struggle for our health and=20
self-determination in both managed  care and consumer directed care. Duals=
=20
demonstration pilots could hold much  promise if they were indeed small pil=
ots, but=20
they are not and I don't believe  they are being used as pilots. And I am s=
ure=20
that my way of seeing the  situation is just that =E2=80=93 my way of seein=
g it. We=20
all see things differently, but  I feel very convinced that without=20
corrective action, too great a number  of our  people will be in danger in =
terms of=20
liberty and changes to  our IHSS without legal protections written into=20
them.
=20
And likewise I feel  that continuity of the specialty care medications and=
=20
treatments that keep us  alive are  being dealt with without sufficient,=20
prudent care, in the  case of some. --That there is no safety net for some =
of=20
the most medically  fragile among us who have conditions that must be treat=
ed=20
immediately, when time  is of the essence and the right medical specialty=
=20
can be a matter of life and  death.

I know we all mean well and that so many of you are working so  much harder=
=20
than I am, trying to make this right. If I have  been unkind or insensitive=
=20
to your effort, or unfair to you , please  forgive me.  It is because I=20
feel so convinced of my vision that  the dangers inherent in these processe=
s=20
have not been sufficiently provided  for.  I'm sure like all people, my=20
perception is just my perception and has  distortions.
 =20
But if anything in my  fears and call for safeguards, rings true with you,=
=20
I beg you to  join in fighting for the most prudent decisions to protect th=
e=20
health and  freedom of Seniors and Persons with Disabilities and the people=
=20
care for us.  Please accept my apology for insensitivity to you if that =20
occurred.
