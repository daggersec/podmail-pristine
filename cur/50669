SEDONA, Ariz., Aug. 27 -- Republican presidential candidate John
McCain<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/m000303/>has
settled on a running mate, and the pair will appear together on Friday
at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, according to Republican sources outside the
campaign.

McCain will notify his choice on Thursday, one source said. The decision is
closely held among just a handful of the senator's top advisers.

Speculation has centered on several candidates, including Minnesota Gov. Tim
Pawlenty<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Tim+Pawlenty?tid=informline>,
former Massachusetts governor Mitt
Romney<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Mitt+Romney?tid=informline>and
Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/l000304/>(I-Conn.).

Choosing Lieberman or someone else who supports abortion rights, such as
former Pennsylvania governor Tom
Ridge<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Tom+Ridge?tid=informline>,
would be risky for a candidate who has worked hard to rally conservatives to
his side, according to a new Washington
Post<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+Washington+Post+Company?tid=informline>
-ABC News<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/ABC+Inc.?tid=informline>poll.
The survey indicates that 20 percent of McCain's supporters would be
less likely to vote for him if he selects a running mate who supports
abortion rights. In a recent interview, McCain told the conservative Weekly
Standard<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+Weekly+Standard+Magazine?tid=informline>that
supporting abortion rights would not be an immediate disqualifier in
his choice.

McCain, hunkered down at his ranch in Sedona, is planning to campaign with
his vice presidential pick in a three-day tour of contested battlegrounds in
Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. "Special Guest TBA" is how his campaign Web
site advertises the Friday event at Wright State
University<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Wright+State+University?tid=informline>
.

Republicans may pass Democratic Sen. Barack
Obama<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/o000167/>and
his running mate, Sen.
Joseph R. Biden<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/b000444/>Jr.
(Del.), on their way to next week's
GOP<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Republican+Party?tid=informline>convention
in St. Paul, Minn. The Democrats have scheduled a bus trip
through Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania at the same time.

The senator from Arizona dropped from public view after a fundraiser Tuesday
night in San Diego, not even leaving his ranch on Wednesday for his routine
trip to Starbucks<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Starbucks+Corporation?tid=informline>.
He conducted phone interviews with local reporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The McCain camp's silence did not stop speculation, with pundits and Web
sites throughout the day mentioning rarely mentioned possible candidates --
including Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison<http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/h001016/>(Tex.),
for instance, who opposes an abortion ban but votes consistently for
antiabortion legislation -- and debating whether recent events helped or
hurt Romney's chances.

But the most controversial candidate remains Lieberman, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee in 2000, who was reelected to the Senate as an
independent after losing the Democratic primary and has infuriated his
former party with his embrace of McCain, a longtime friend.

"You keep hearing that he really wants Lieberman," said a Republican source
who talks frequently with McCain's advisers. The source added that McCain
"can be stubborn."

Another senior GOP adviser said picking Lieberman would be a way to say that
McCain is a "transformational politician," but it was unlikely that the
benefit of that would offset the angst it would cause among party
conservatives.

Republican antiabortion forces have made it known that the outrage that
would be felt at next week's party convention over a Lieberman selection
would dwarf any disunity on display at the Democratic gathering in Denver.
And while some conservative activists love to hear Lieberman accuse Obama of
being inexperienced, they have drawn the line at the notion that the party's
vice presidential nominee could be someone who voted against the
confirmations of conservative Supreme Court Justices Clarence
Thomas<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Clarence+Thomas?tid=informline>and
Samuel
A. Alito Jr.<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Samuel+Alito?tid=informline>

McCain is solidly opposed to abortion rights, and nearly six in 10 of his
supporters polled said abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.

In the telephone survey of 1,108 registered voters taken Aug. 19 to Aug. 22,
which tested six possible vice presidential candidates, most said the choice
of a running mate would not change their vote for president. That was
especially true of lesser-known candidates: Pawlenty (86 percent); Florida
Gov. Charlie Crist<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Charlie+Crist?tid=informline>(83
percent); Sen.
John Thune <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/t000250/>(S.D.)
(81 percent) and Ridge (80 percent).

Of the six, Romney would generate the largest following -- 20 percent say
adding the former Massachusetts governor would make them more likely to
support McCain. But nearly as many -- 16 percent -- said they would be less
apt to vote GOP with Romney on the ticket.

Lieberman would appear to do the most damage. Overall, about one in five
voters said choosing the former Democrat would make them less likely to back
McCain, more than the 12 percent who would be more inclined to support the
GOP nominee. And perhaps more tellingly, among those currently supporting
McCain, 22 percent said they would be less apt to support the GOP nominee if
he picks Lieberman. Just 9 percent of those backing Obama would be more
interested in voting Republican with Lieberman as the No. 2.

Democrats are already gearing up to attack McCain's vice presidential pick,
no matter whom it might be. Progressive Accountability, a left-leaning
advocacy group, has prepared a dossier on five contenders: Romney,
Lieberman, Pawlenty, former Ohio congressman Rob
Portman<http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rob+Portman?tid=informline>and
Rep.
Eric Cantor <http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001046/>(Va.).

Each of the opposition research documents uses the identical header, naming
the McCain ally in question next to the phrase "McSame as Bush."
