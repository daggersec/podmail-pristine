Just met with the farm workers for an hour here in Palo Alto.  Very
positive experience.  I'll let Lorella expand, but from outside the room
there was a lot of clapping and cheering, and chanting of S=C3=AD Se Peude.

Two SC radio interviews today:

1) We did a repeat with Cynthia Hardy that ended up being a very brief
conversation HRC joined in progress about health disparities in communities
of color.

2) She did a slightly tougher but ultimately very strong interview with
Judi Gatson of 103.1 KISS FM.  She asked HRC about her recent comments on
not being in this for herself, and said that some doubt that.  The answer
was very strong, and invoked a little reflection on sexism.  She asked
about youth, but the framing was interesting, which was that BdB and Eric
Garner's mom endorse, but children of BdB and Eric Garner's sister do not.
The other question most of note was Judi observing that she hears people in
the community say that HRC embraces Obama only to pander to the AfAm
population.  Interesting that that broke through, (Stephanie if you talked
to her I'd be curious to hear more about how often she's hearing that),
HRC's answer was good, she said that Senator Sanders claiming that was
offensive, that she nominated him at the convention, campaigned for him,
worked for him for 4 years, and that it "affects" her "personally" to hear
Sanders and his supporters say that stuff.

Finance event in Atherton was largely uneventful. She did take questions.
She dinged Uber when talking about the Kalamazoo shooter, which thrilled
many in the audience here in Silicon Valley, I'm sure.  No encryption
questions.

One more finance event and then we're off to LA to spend the night.

Good live interview with Univision local this morning.  Bernie was supposed
to be on right after us but bailed late last night.  She did her pitch,
talked about immigration, no fireworks.

Left there and dos two back of house visits, Caesars and Harrah's.  Bernie
was at Harrah's immediately before us, stayed 5 minutes and left.  We spent
about 25 shaking hands and telling people where to caucus.

Left there and went to 2 caucus sites, the second of which she's working
the (long) line at as we speak.

The Bernie folks are definitely here, but our organizers tell us these are
very strong locations for us.

We visited the home of Vicki Early, a retired California utility company
employee who moved to Nevada to buy her first home, and installed solar
panels on the roof, which she could afford with the Public Utility
Commission offsets on her fixed income until they got rolled back.  She and
her boyfriend Tyrone showed HRC the panels in the back yard and told her
story.  HRC had the press come in closer to listen and then dos brief
remarks of her own on the importance of this issue for people like Vicki.
Pretty great stuff.

Next we went to Youthbuild, an organization with a Nevada chapter that
builds houses for Habitat for Humanity.  We walked through a big warehouse
where HRC individually met about 15 workers.  She was intrigued by how most
of them found the place, which was through Craigslist, and probed them on
what they were learning and what they wanted to do next.  Most wanted to
continue in the building trades.  She spoke briefly, and invited the
Youthbuild and Habitat folks to speak as well.

We've also squeezed in two SC radio interviews.  Both went well, talked
about the Clyburn's endorsement, support for President Obama, her plans on
college affordability.

Headed to the town hall with high school students now.

Women and Families Roundtable:

Very engaging discussion, topics ranged from early childhood education to
food deserts to Flint.  HRC brought up Flint proactively, and a woman stood
up and said that she had family there, appreciated HRC saying that, her
work there, and that her assessment was exactly right.  Audience was
diverse across the board, lots of millennials and lots of young people who
work for various NGOs and advocacy groups with a lot of very good questions
and passionate comments. At the end HRC commented on her life's work,
figuring out how to make difference in people's lives as opposed to
promising them the moon, and making sure lives are better when you're done
than when you started.  Wasn't too hot but poignant and noticeable
following 45 minutes of discussing the importance of reading to your
children every day.

We're now going to divert course and make a pit stop at a woman's house who
has been affected by the Nevada Public Utility Commissions retroactive rate
changes on people selling solar back to the grid.  Pool is with us.

Woke up in Milwaukee this morning and did a fundraiser at Harbor House.
Very pretty setting just outside of downtown on a partially frozen bright
blue Lake Michigan.  She gave a pretty standard stump, no Qs, and we headed
out.

South Carolina was quite something.  Good crowd of about 450/500 at
Denmark-Olar Elementary School (home of the Vikings).  HRC stuck largely to
her remarks and outlined her $125 billion plan to improve underserved
communities, and took questions on just about everything: social security,
health care multiple times, body cameras, Flint, homeless vets, Trump,
student loans, who she's pick for VP, and a little girl who gave her a
drawing that said on it: "I'm not bossy I have leadership skills."  It was
a very engaged, high-energy affair.

Following the town hall and a long ropeline, we did 2 TV stand ups and a
print interview.  Discussion in both revolved around race relations, the
state of the race, and education, which HRC discussed at length in a
dilapidated older locker room with paint people off the walls in the
background.

Our print interviewer, Princess Williams, was really impressive.  She won
an award last year for best student journalist in a college under 5000
students from the South Carolina Press Association.  She was nervous but
did a great job, asked HRC about education, what we can't do beyond
government programs to help level the playing field, attracting young
voters, and what life is like off the campaign trail.

We're in the air now headed back north to St. Paul for the Humphrey-Mondale
Dinner.

Happy Election Day!<br>

We just went to the Ward 10 polling location at Parker Varney School<br>
in Manchester.<br>
<br>
HRC arrived to volunteers chanting &quot;I believe that she will win!&quot;=
 and<br>
worked the crowd.=C2=A0 She shook about 75 hands and took lots of photos,<b=
r>
and then did an impromptu stand up with the morning show anchors.<br>
They asked her about how she&#39;s feeling and expectations, she just<br>
talked about how excited she was to be out talking to people and her<br>
love for New Hampshire.<br>
<br>
We took a few more photos and talked to WMUR for a few minutes, which<br>
will air at noon.<br>
<br>
Now we&#39;re in Nashua now headed to another location and on the phone<br>
live with Mike Pomp of WTSN radio.=C2=A0 Good conversation, she&#39;s talki=
ng<br>
about her experiences up here, basically a perfect Election Day drive<br>
time interview.<br>

Boston affiliates.=C2=A0 =C2=A0Lots about the state of the race here and th=
e<br>

for accepting DSCC money that came in part from Wall Street.<br>
<br>
We taped Rachel Maddow after the event.=C2=A0 It opened with the staffing<b=
r>
question and then covered the waterfront...Flint, trust, attacks,<br>
transcripts.=C2=A0 We let it go so Rachel would spend more time on the<br>
positive which she did.<br>

Flint was quite moving.=C2=A0 When we walked in the church and the water<br=
>
fountains were covered and marked &quot;out of order,&quot; all we&#39;ve r=
ead and<br>
seen in the news suddenly became much more real.<br>
<br>
HRC met with mayor and an usher briefly, and she said that she fight<br>
to keep the lights from dimming on this.<br>
<br>
The crowd was extraordinarily supportive.=C2=A0 Her remarks were brief<br>
(12/15) but strong, with powerful response.<br>
<br>
Afterwards she took photos, she did a very quick local standup in the<br>
sanctuary (all about Flint), met with a group of local pastors and<br>
went into the stakeholders/electeds meeting with the mayor.<br>
<br>
On the way to the airport we called the editor of the National<br>
Newspaper Association, quick 5 minute interview on the importance of<br>
Flint and their being many other Flints.=C2=A0 Transcript to follow.<br>
