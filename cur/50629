yes, I think the frame is that we need her help.  Hoyer is out there.  If
BAM puts out a press release.  Then, it's likely the reporters will ask
Cardin and he'll say HRC too.

BAM said she wants to be helpful and not left out.  Plus, it's important to
have her voice, the Dean, in support of Hillary out there.
