You're right - I think that's what he's referring to

Not totally sure what he's referring to, but two things from him that we're=
 testing in NH right now are:

--A message about how Bernie's health care plan will cost millions of jobs =
in the insurance industry
--A message about how the GOP wants to defeat HRC and we shouldn't give the=
m what they want...if I had to guess, this is the one he's referring to.

We also tested a message about the Supreme Court a while back and it didn't=
 do terribly well, but I told him last week that I think it's a fine thing =
to touch on since it raises the stakes.
