On Wednesday night, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, President Obama is =
delivering a major address on health insurance reform to a special joint =
session of Congress. It'll be a historic event -- and a turning point in =
our push for real reform.=20

So we've organized special watch parties that night for all Organizing for =
America supporters, their friends, neighbors, and families -- and a local =
volunteer has decided to host one in your area.

We'll gather together to hear directly from the President. And after the =
speech, everyone at these parties will be able to take part in an =
important conference call with former Obama for America campaign manager =
David Plouffe about the work we'll still need to do to help pass real =
reform this year.=20

Will you come to a watch party during the President's address on Wednesday =
evening?

http://my.barackobama.com/WatchParties?zip=3D20016

This is a great opportunity to interact with other supporters who share =
your passion for reform at this critical moment. And it's an even better =
time to bring along that friend or co-worker who has had questions about =
reform or has heard a lot of the misinformation -- on Wednesday night, =
they'll be able to hear the facts straight from the President.=20

With Congress back in session, we're ready to kick off the final sprint =
toward passing real reform. There's no better way to do it than coming =
together as a community. Hope you can make it.=20
