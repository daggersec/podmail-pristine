John --

When Michelle and I decided that I would run for President, it was because =
of a shared belief in the power of community and connection, a commitment =
to the idea that we are our brothers' keepers.

With your help, that is how I have tried to govern.

Now -- with just 50 days until the November elections -- the progress we =
have achieved together is under attack.

But I have seen what you can do when the stakes are high, and I have never =
been more confident in your ability to deliver.

John, I am asking you to take the next step in your support for Organizing =
for America.

Because this moment is so critical, another supporter has pledged to match =
any donation you make right now. A $5 donation will become $10.

Will you make a donation today and answer your fellow supporter's pledge =
to match whatever you can give?

https://donate.barackobama.com/Match2010h

Here's how it works:

-- You choose the amount you are able to give -- and it will be doubled by =
someone willing to match that amount.

-- You will be able to write a note to the person who matched your =
donation and let them know why you decided to own a piece of this =
movement.

There are a lot of people out there who do not believe we can continue =
this work.

But we've defied the naysayers before. It was supporters like you who =
stood up and said, I can call my neighbor and ask her to vote. I can write =
a letter to my member of Congress. I can volunteer a few hours to go door =
to door -- even after a hard day at work.

It was this commitment that ensured millions of Americans will no longer =
suffer the indignity of inadequate care, simply because an illness came =
too soon, or a procedure too late.

It was this commitment that allowed us to pass the toughest financial =
reform regulations since the Great Depression.

And it is with this commitment in mind that I have gone to work every day. =
Over the coming months, I will continue to fight for what is right and for =
what is necessary -- but I cannot do this alone.

Republicans have made it clear what they will do if elected this fall -- =
attempt to repeal our historic achievements and obstruct progress on the =
work that lies ahead.

But if we remember what we can build together, we can continue moving =
America forward.

Today, it starts with you. Your matched donation this month will enable us =
to execute the largest, most ambitious plan our party has ever run in an =
election of this kind. It will fund our Vote 2010 efforts in all 50 =
states. And it will help us stand up to the special interests trying to =
take over Congress.=20

It can shake up this fall's elections.

We built this movement with support from people like you, with small =
donations from millions of donors. And that was a conscious choice -- a =
choice that required us to demand more of our friends, our neighbors, and =
ourselves.

A fellow grassroots supporter is asking you to join them today -- and has =
pledged to match your individual donation.

Please donate $5 or more to help grow this movement in the critical weeks =
ahead:

https://donate.barackobama.com/Match2010h

Thank you,

President Barack Obama
