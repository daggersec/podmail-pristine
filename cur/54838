	Hi John,=20

	Sorry to hear about the plane, but very glad everyone is ok.=20

	For tomorrow, both the Board Meeting & Energy call-in
information are below. I've told Steve Phillips that you're stuck in
Rwanda for the time being. Let me know if you want to try and connect
with him via phone, or if you'd prefer to reschedule when you're back in
town. For Thursday, we went ahead and cancelled the Jay Eisenhoffer Mtg
(Development Mtg.) because Debby thought it was best to let him know in
advance. Leaving everything else on the schedule until I hear otherwise.
All your other Thursday meetings are via phone anyways so thought there
would be a chance you could still hop on.=20
