What was interesting about the latest emails was how perceptive Chelsea was i=
n
her observations and suggestions.  Let me suggest an idea that either of you=
 can
pass on, or not, at your discretion.  I will not write about this publicly b=
ut I have
been thinking about this for some time.

1) A major priority for HRC and the campaign should be an aggressive outreac=
h
to younger members of the House and Senate, and younger generation people
in business and philanthropy who could come to Washington as next generation=

players in a potential Administration.  A major generational outreach to bri=
ng new
blood and fresh ideas.  This is should be, in principle, a core strategy of t=
he campaign
and her administration as a project for dramatic change and looking forward t=
o the
future.

2)  The thought occurs that Chelsea could be an ideal person to lead this.  S=
he is of
the younger generation and an ideal person to inspire and recruit others.  A=
nd as a
new mom she could do a lot of this work without having to travel much, even f=
rom
home if she prefers.

Again, I won't write about this publicly to propose it, not my place in a co=
lumn to
publicly suggest this sort of thing to moms and daughters unless it happens a=
nd
publicity would help.  You know the Clintons in a way I do not, so I thought=
 I would
at least whisper this idea into your ears. I do think a major generational o=
utreach for a next generation administration would be a very positive move..=
