Since it didn't come up, let's do a statement keyed off the legislation tha=

Subject: Re: Memo on Cadillac Tax for HRC

If it does comes up, here is my suggested response.  If it does not come up=
, we'll regroup and work on a statement to get out next week:


Q: Would you repeal the Cadillac tax?

*      Yes, I would. While I continue to believe that we need a bold set of=
 policies to reduce the growth of health costs that eats into workers' wage=
s, I do not think we should pass the full burden of doing this onto the bac=
ks of consumers and workers.

*      The Affordable Care Act is already working to slow the growth of hea=
lth spending. We have had the slowest growth in health spending in five dec=
ades.

*      Yet, too many Americans - who had good health insurance before and s=
till have good insurance after the ACA - are not experiencing this downward=
 trend in health spending.  Instead they are seeing their deductibles rise,=
 their prescription drug costs skyrocket and they don't know how to make en=
ds meet and stay health.

*      I worry that if the Cadillac Tax is implemented, workers who have fo=
ught hard for good health insurance, simply won't have it any longer becaus=
e employers will demand workers pay more and more out of pocket.

*      Just this week the Kaiser Family Foundation released a survey showin=
g that the average deductible that Americans with employer based coverage h=
ave to pay before their insurance kicks in is over $1300, and has grown 7X =
faster than workers wages since 2010.

*      Now, let me be clear I do not believe that we should simply repeal t=
he Cadillac Tax without determining how we would pay for lost revenue - thi=
s revenue is essential to helping subsidize affordable health insurance thr=
ough the health exchanges and allowing the federal government to robustly h=
elp states expand Medicaid.

*       If Congress repeals the Cadillac Tax, it must pay for it and we mus=
t work together to reform the delivery of health care to make it more value=
 driven and more cost efficient.

Madam Secretary -

I wanted to be sure you saw this memo on the Cadillac Tax.

In short, we are recommending that you call for repeal but go back to your =
2008 position that workers over $250K not be exempt from paying taxes on th=
eir health care. This will allow us to take in some revenue and show a cons=
istency of your position without harming middle class workers. It would do =
little, however, to control health care consumption and costs.

There remains a divide among your advisors with the economic team intereste=
d in you offering a "fix it" approach (Option 3) in the memo and your polit=
ical team very interested in you coming out for full repeal because of the =
union implications (Option 1). Several of your advisors - Neera and Chris, =
chief among them - offered this middle ground that Jake and I thought could=
 work (Option 2).

Subsequently, I've talked to Randi Weingarten who has been taking the pulse=
 of the unions in it. While she thinks they can live with the $250K positio=
n, she thinks you don't gain much from it and feels the most important thin=
g is that you get out there not only offering empathy for workers and the c=
ost-shifting they are experiencing but you make clear that this tax would m=
ean health savings on the backs of workers and you won't do it that way.

If you did come out for repeal, we would recommend coupling it with strong =
delivery system reforms and making clear that Congress find a way to pay fi=
r it (we don't recommend having you offer the pay-for since they are active=
ly working on it I the Senate).

Because you are going on Meet the Press tomorrow, we wanted to check in on =
whether you wanted to make your position clear on the show. Comms team feel=
s that only straight up repeal would make news.

Jake and John can weigh in further and we are happy to discuss.

Thanks,
Ann

<div>Your point on R version is key.&nbsp; Our Bernie contrast rests on def=
ending ACA, so crucial to cast this as a fix and to be on the lookout for R=
 efforts to make this a Trojan Horse for broader dismantling of the ACA. &n=

<div>Given the politics now w bipartisan support including Schumer, I'll su=
pport repeal w &quot;sense of the Senate&quot; that revenues would have to =
be found. I'd be open to a range of options to do that. But we have to be c=
areful that the R version passes which begins
 the unraveling of the ACA.&nbsp;<br>

<div>Madam Secretary -&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I wanted to be sure you saw this memo on the Cadillac Tax.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In short, we are recommending that you call for repeal but go back to =
your 2008 position that workers over $250K not be exempt from paying taxes =
on their health care. This will allow us to take in some revenue and show a=
 consistency of your position without
 harming middle class workers. It would do little, however, to control heal=
th care consumption and costs.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>There remains a divide among your advisors with the economic team inte=
rested in you offering a &quot;fix it&quot; approach (Option 3) in the memo=
 and your political team very interested in you coming out for full repeal =
because of the union implications (Option
 1). Several of your advisors - Neera and Chris, chief among them - offered=
 this middle ground that Jake and I thought could work (Option 2).</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Subsequently, I've talked to Randi Weingarten who has been taking the =
pulse of the unions in it. While she thinks they can live with the $250K po=
sition, she thinks you don't gain much from it and feels the most important=
 thing is that you get out there
 not only offering empathy for workers and the cost-shifting they are exper=
iencing but you make clear that this tax would mean health savings on the b=
acks of workers and you won't do it that way.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If you did come out for repeal, we would recommend coupling it with st=
rong delivery system reforms and making clear that Congress find a way to p=
ay fir it (we don't recommend having you offer the pay-for since they are a=
ctively working on it I the Senate).</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Because you are going on Meet the Press tomorrow, we wanted to check i=
n on whether you wanted to make your position clear on the show. Comms team=
 feels that only straight up repeal would make news.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Jake and John can weigh in further and we are happy to discuss.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
