John,
=20
This is what I left you a message about earlier.
=20
We are worried about the potential for leaks about our planning for next =20
week given the number of people who have been contacted re:  transition.  Th=
is is=20
obviously a risk that goes well beyond the  national security agencies to al=
l=20
of the agencies. =20
=20
As people have been contacted, we have endeavored to underscore discretion =20
and confidentiality, but I would be inclined to send a single message to all=
=20
who  have been contacted on national security to reinforce the point.  But d=
o =20
not want to proceed unless you agree and wonder how/whether others are =20
handling.
=20
Please advise.
