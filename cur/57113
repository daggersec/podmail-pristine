*McCain more conservative than his image (AP, 4/14/08)*
By Libby Quaid
The independent label sticks to John McCain because he antagonizes fellow
Republicans and likes to work with Democrats. But a different label applies
to his actual record: conservative. ...McCain leans to the right on issue
after issue, not just on the Iraq war but also on abortion, gay rights, gun
control and other issues that matter to his party's social conservatives.

*McCain's Campaign Will Be a Long Balancing Act (Bloomberg, 4/14/08)*
By Albert R. Hunt
The Republican Party's success in five of the last seven U.S. presidential
elections has flowed from the enthusiastic support of a diverse collection
of economic, social and national security conservatives. That coalition is
fraying. John McCain, the only Republican who would have a shot at winning
the presidency, faces a challenge in keeping this three-legged stool intact
for the November election.

*'Steady Hand' for the G.O.P. Guides McCain on a New Path (NY Times,
4/13/08)*
By KATE ZERNIKE
When Senator John McCain's campaign was collapsing last summer, it was
Charlie Black who set the comeback strategy: Mr. McCain had to win New
Hampshire. When conservative opposition threatened to derail Mr. McCain just
as he was surging again this winter, it was Charlie Black who called
prominent conservatives to secure their backing. And when Mr. McCain was
finally the last man standing, it was Charlie Black who engineered the
campaign's takeover of the Republican National Committee.

John McCain, maverick icon of American duty and patriotism, is as much a

collaboration with Mark Salter, who shaped the candidate's biography into a

Sen. John McCain disputed charges of flip-flopping on his plan to address

increased government intervention was consistent with his past remarks.
"It's just factually incorrect," he said, to suggest otherwise.

*John McCain's Enormous Hypocrisy on the War (AOL News Bloggers, 4/13/08)*
Posted by Cenk Uygur
If you think John McCain is a straight shooter on the war, wait till you get
a load of the video we found from his speeches on the Senate floor. He now
claims that withdrawal is unacceptable and that we must stay in Iraq until
it is a viable nation that can police itself. He now says he doesn't care if
we stay in Iraq a hundred years. As you will see below this is exactly the
opposite of what he argued in Somalia and Haiti when we had a Democratic
president. He demanded withdrawal not in an orderly fashion from those
countries, but immediately -- damn the consequences.

*Marketing McCain(TM) (Washington Post, 4/12/08)*
By Michael D. Shear and Juliet Eilperin; A01
Republican Sen. John McCain is a champion of an unpopular war, he is trying
to succeed an unpopular GOP president, and he is a member of an increasingly
unpopular party in a year when the historic race of his rivals has caused
hundreds of thousands of voters to register as Democrats.

*McCain's expediency express (Boston Globe, 4/13/08)*
THE CORE of John McCain's appeal as a candidate has always been his
reputation for taking positions that offend special interests. This
newspaper endorsed McCain in the Republican presidential primary late last
year because - to quote ourselves - he "actually levels with voters even at
significant political expense." But as his quixotic candidacy grew into the
Republican nomination, McCain's "straight-talk express" started going off
the rails.

*Embrace Your Inner Teddy Roosevelt: An economic agenda for John McCain

John McCain is for low taxes, rapid economic growth, and free trade. ... But
if McCain is to persuade the American people that his vision of a great
nation is superior to the Democrats' vision ..., he will have to give vent
to his populist, reforming instincts, and to the basic decency that prompted
him to ignore the so-called Republican base, oppose the Bush tax cuts as
excessively favorable to the already-comfortable, and support regularizing
the status of immigrants.

*Can McCain Win Massachusetts? (RealClearPolitics, 4/12/08)*
By Anil Adyanthaya
Can a Republican presidential candidate win Massachusetts? In most years,
because of the state's dark blue reputation, the answer clearly would be no.
But if the race is between John McCain and Barack Obama, there is an
opportunity for a Republican to claim Massachusetts's 12 electoral votes.
This opportunity exists because of the respective appeal of McCain and Obama
to the true dominant political "party" in Massachusetts - the independents.

President Bush has been delaying action to reduce the United States'

we'll have a surge and if it works then we can bring our troops home," Rep.
Pelosi, D-Calif., told Face The Nation host Bob Schieffer. "And now there's
a pause in withdrawal, and redeployment out, but we haven't really had any
major redeployment out.

policy =96 although to use that term is to imply that the US even has a fisc=

Less than two weeks ago, as final preparations were being made for the visit
of Pope Benedict XVI to the United States, the bishop of Camden, N.J.,
announced plans to close or merge nearly half the parishes in his diocese.
Meanwhile, Catholics in New Orleans, Boston, New York, Toledo, Ohio, and
nearly three dozen other dioceses are mourning the loss of parishes and
parochial schools they grew up in.

*Food Prices Could Stir Social Unrest, IMF Warns (AP/Washington Post,
4/13/08)*
By Harry Dunphy; A03
The head of the International Monetary Fund warned yesterday that if food
prices remain high, there will be dire consequences for people in many
developing countries, especially those in Africa. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
said high food prices could also result in trade imbalances that would
affect major advanced economies, "so it is not only a humanitarian
question."

Iraqi and U.S. military forces on Saturday pushed deeper into the Sadr City

loyal to anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. A curfew imposed on Sadr City
more than a week ago was lifted, and residents appeared on the streets as
shops reopened, despite the large presence of U.S. and Iraqi security

Senator Barack Obama fought back Saturday against accusations from his

values, in a flare-up that left him on the defensive before a series of
primaries that could test his ability to win over white voters in
economically distressed communities.

trying to lay to rest. Bill Clinton, who is often called one of the savviest
politicians of his generation, may have missed that particular lesson. Or
