&gt;&gt; &gt; Claim: Clinton Collected $50K Per Month From MF Global<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Former president&#39;s new firm Teneo Strategy was hired to b=
oost<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Corzine.by=A0Neil W. McCabe12/05/2011<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; A former MF Global employee accused former president William =
J. Clinton<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; of collecting $50,000 per month through his Teneo advisory fi=
rm in the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; months before the brokerage careened towards its Halloween fi=
ling for<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Chapter 11 bankruptcy.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Teneo was hired by MF Global=92s former CEO Jon S. Corzine to=
 improve his<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; image and to enhance his connections with Clinton=92s politic=
al family, said<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the employee, who asked that his name be withheld because he =
feared<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; retribution.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; =93They were supposed to be helping Corzine improve his image=
 as a CEO=97I<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; guess you can tell how that went,=94 he said. Corzine resigne=
d as CEO and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; chairman November 4.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Before Corzine joined MF Global in May 2010, the firm was a s=
mart and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; well-run commodities broker, a culture that was turned upside=
-down by his<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; leadership style, he said.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; =93The traders would be shaking their heads,=94 he said. =93T=
hey would come<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; back to their desk and say, =91Well, I thought we were going =
to do this=97but<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Corzine would come by and do something else all by himself,=
=92=94 he said.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The Teneo contract with MF Global lasted at least five months=
, he said.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; =93The board cancelled it after Corzine resigned.=94<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The source, who is no longer associated with MF Global, said =
Teneo is a<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; dual-track company with one side devoted to merchant and inve=
stment banking<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; and the other side set up to provide image and strategy consu=
lting services.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Clinton is the chairman of the company=92s advisory board. Hi=
s duties and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; compensation have not been released. The other member of the =
board is former<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; British prime minister Tony Blair.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Two of the three founding partners are very close to the form=
er<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; president and his wife, Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton=
. They are<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Douglas J. Band, who is the former president=92s counselor an=
d has served on<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; his personal staff since 1995 and Declan Kelly, who earned th=
e =93Hillraiser=94<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; status in the secretary=92s 2008 run for president for bundli=
ng more than<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; $100,000 for the campaign.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Another prominent member of the Clinton political family is T=
om Shea.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Shea is a senior vice president for Teneo Strategy and served=
 as Corzine=92s<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; chief of staff, when Corzine was the governor of New Jersey.<=
br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Kelly sold his public relations firm Financial Dynamics in 20=
06 to FTI<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; for $340 million, and stayed with that company until July 200=
9, when he<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; joined the State Department as the Economic Envoy to Northern=
 Ireland.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; The source said, =93Kelly was given a job they created out ou=
