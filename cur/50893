Highlight #1
*Davis: Charlie Black not Going Anywhere *(MSNBC 06/24/08 7:50am)
JOE SCARBOROUGH: Let's bring you right now McCain campaign manager Rick
Davis.

[ . . . ]

SCARBOROUGH: I'm not much of a numbers guy but these numbers don't look good
=2E . . *Newsweek *has Obama up by 15, *LA Times*, Obama up by 12.
ABC/*Washington
Post* up by six, ABC/Gallup up by six. What's going on and how does your guy
catch up?

RICK DAVIS: . . . look, we've got work to do. It's early. Feel very good
about the fact we're well positioned with voters . . . I feel very bullish
about it.

[ . . . ]

DAVIS: No question there's a challenge for our campaign with the challenges
that are out there economically with the American public. I think John
McCain has talked a lot about the fact we need to have immediate action for
the American people. That's why he offered up before the holiday season
started this summer a gas tax holiday. Obama opposed it. . .

SCARBOROUGH: Almost every economist disagrees with that. I'm not so sure
that working class voters agree with the economists. Let me ask you about
the other two issues. War in Iraq. The polls seem split right now. On
terrorism John McCain up 19 percentage points. Was Charlie black right if a
terror attack hits US soil between now and the election? That it will be
positive for the McCain campaign?

DAVIS: No, Charlie is wrong in his comments and Senator McCain said so the
other day and I'm sure Charlie regrets them and=97

SCARBOROUGH: Is Charlie going to come out and apologize?

DAVIS: Joe, the bottom line is, the American people have figured out that
the guy who is best able to serve his commander in chief the first day he's
elected to president is John McCain. The fact they recognize that is a huge
step forward for our campaign. It gives us an opportunity to have a dialogue
on them out of some kind of level of knowledge and respect that the American
people are showing the senator in this regard. It's a very positive thing.
It's good. We would never extrapolate that into the kind of discussion
you're talking about.

SCARBOROUGH: Rick, Charlie has apologized. Has senator McCain accepted the
apology and will he be staying with the campaign?

DAVIS: Sure. Charlie is not going anywhere. The senator understands that all
of us make mistakes in the course of a campaign. It wouldn't be a campaign
if that didn't happen.

[ . . . ]

Highlight #2
*McCain's Failures To Rally Conservatives and Evangelicals Around His
Campaign Examined* (FNC, 06/25/08, 7:20am)
[=85]

GRETCHEN CARLSON: Alright. If John McCain isn't actively pursuing the
evangelical vote, what about the conservative vote? Can you parse that away
from evangelicals?

MARGERET HOOVER: Absolutely! This is a really good point, and I'm so glad
you brought this up. Conservatives, traditionally we thought of
conservatives as the three-legged stool. Economic, social conservatives, and
national security conservatives. That was Reagan's coalition. We have made
the mistake, now a days, trying to pull that coalition still together, when
they are really very separate groups that believe different things. John
McCain is going after economic conservatives, national security
conservatives. He is not reaching out, or trying to get social conservatives
, like James Dobson, to vote for him. And James Dobson has said, he's not
going to.

[=85]

CARLSON: You believe John, that McCain has shored up the conservative base
in the GOP.

JOHN AVLON: Polls show that John McCain has done a very good job of uniting
his party around him. Folks who said, as a matter of principle, never
support John McCain, most of those folks are falling into line. *And so I
think McCain deserves a lot of credit for uniting the republican party
around his candidacy, because they understand that John McCain is the single
best hope republicans have for holding onto the White House.* And it's
because of his independence, not in spite of it. His brand of patriotism,
political reform, fiscal discipline, and national security, that's things
that republicans should look forward to.

CARLSON: *And yet, a new poll shows that only 58% of the conservative base
is rallying around John McCain. So it remains to be see whether they will
actually show up in November.*

HOOVER: Lot's of work to do. Definitely lots of work to do.

Highlight #3
*McCain is the "Comfortable Shoe," Election Will be a Referendum on
Obama *(MSNBC
06/24/08 8:39am)
JOE SCARBOROUGH: Not looking good . . . how does John McCain claw his way
back into this race?

CHUCK TODD: Well look, I think you do it by making this a referendum on
Barack Obama. I think that that's their intent. I think that that's what
this campaign is going to be about. . . it's always going to be a question
about Obama. I think that's what McCain wants this to be. McCain's going to
be kind of the comfortable shoe. The safety net . . . if you're just not
comfortable enough with Obama you'll be just comfortable enough with McCain
=2E . . <https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/ekwg9p0tcc>

Highlight #4
*Letterman: "Grandpa's Losing It" *(CBS 06/24/08 11:44pm)
NARRATOR: Yesterday, John McCain offered $300 million to anyone who
developed an environmentally friendly car battery. Sadly, there is no such
offer. You see, the Senator is a very old man who is getting by on little to
no sleep. When he gets tired, he says crazy things. This morning he offered
m $500 million to get his glasses. John McCain: Grandpa's Losing
It.<https://issuealliance.box.net/shared/03wbwre4o8>

Local Highlight #1
*Local News Highlights McCain Embarrassments Over Lobbyists and Charlie
Black Comments *(LA-KNBC-4, 06/24/08, 6:48pm)
STEVE HANDELSMAN: [=85] This is just the latest in a string of staff
embarrassments for McCain, who's had to let go staff who turned out to be
lobbying on the side. But Charlie Black might survive, in part, because he's
so very very close personally with McCain. And in part, because so many
people in the political world believe what Charlie Black said is actually
true. Whatever John McCain said about what Charlie Black said. [=85]

out that the guy who is best able to serve his commander in chief the first =
day
he&#39;s elected to president is John McCain. The fact they recognize that i=
s a
huge step forward for our campaign. It gives us an opportunity to have a
dialogue on them out of some kind of level of knowledge and respect that the
American people are showing the senator in this regard. It&#39;s a very posi=

really good point, and I&#39;m so glad you brought this up. Conservatives,
traditionally we thought of conservatives as the three-legged stool. Economi=
c,
social conservatives, and national security conservatives. That was Reagan&#=

coalition. We have made the mistake, now a days, trying to pull that coaliti=
on
still together, when they are really very separate groups that believe
different things. John McCain is going after economic conservatives, nationa=

security conservatives. He is not reaching out, or trying to get social
conservatives , like James Dobson, to vote for him. And James Dobson has sai=

he&#39;s not going to.</span><br style=3D"font-family: times new roman,serif=
