John,
 
I just saw the newest poll numbers for the Todd Akin-Claire McCaskill race. Akin is leading Claire by four points-49 to 45 percent.

This is after Akin's offensive remarks about everything from "legitimate rape" to whether Claire is "ladylike" enough to be a Senator. We absolutely have to do something about this.

The GOP and Super PACs are back on board with his campaign and attacking Claire with everything they've got. There's no secret why: they have to beat Claire to take the Senate.

If we all join together and help Claire now-before the deadline at midnight on Friday-I know she can win. All it takes is donations of $5 or more from Democrats nationwide. Can I count on you to be one of them?

Click here to donate directly to Claire's campaign before the deadline at midnight Friday-time is running out. 

[ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kg4mccaskill?refcode=4 ]

Having someone like Akin in the U.S. Senate is really contrary to everything I believe good government should be. And it's especially disconcerting when you think about the person he'd be replacing.

Claire has proven herself to be one of our most effective, progressive leaders, someone we can all count on to push for the things we believe in, from women's rights, to affordable health care, to protecting seniors.

Please join me in standing with Claire today. [ https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/kg4mccaskill?refcode=4 ]

Thanks for your help,

Kirsten
