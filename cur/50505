Wonder if they mean individual donations.  Or implying that their general
grassroots programs help everyone.  Hard to see how you could run super pac
ads for/against multiple candidates.

FYI -

*Koch Brothers Plan to Fund 'Several' GOP 2016 Presidential Hopefuls *

May 24, 2015 4:49 PM EDT

The good news for Republican presidential candidates seeking to get a slice
of Koch brothers cash is that the siblings, two of the world's richest
individuals, seem to be in a sharing mood.

In a Saturday interview on the Larry Kudlow Show,
<http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/koch-brothers-several-republican/2015/05/=
23/id/646462/>
a
nationally syndicated radio broadcast, David Koch let it slip that the
roughly $900 million
<https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-26/kochs-to-play-big-i=
n-2016-1-billion-big>
that he and his brother, Charles, plan to lavish on the 2016 presidential
race could find its way into the hands of more than one GOP contender.

"We are thinking of supporting several Republicans," David Koch said,
adding, "If we're happy with the policies that these individuals are
supporting, we'll finance their campaigns."

=E2=80=9CIf we're happy with the policies that these individuals are suppor=
ting, we
will finance their campaigns.=E2=80=9D

David Koch

Koch said the brothers would begin writing checks to individual candidates
in "the primary season, winter and next spring."

The pledge to fund multiple Republicans is consistent with what Charles
Koch told *USA Today* in April about the candidacies of Wisconsin Governor
Scott Walker, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Texas Senator Ted Cruz,
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He indicated
all six were at the top of the list in terms of who might receive funding.

"Those are the ones we have talked to the most and who seem to be the
possible leaders," Charles Koch said.

Cruz, Rubio and Paul all spoke at the Koch brothers' event in Palm Springs,
California, in January, which was dubbed the "American Recovery Policy
Forum." Walker has been a frequent recipient
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-17/scott-walker-is-king=
-of-kochworld>
of Koch donations, and Bush also is considered to be still in the running
<http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-22/kochs-eye-five-repub=
lican-presidential-prospects-for-support>for
Koch backing.

"What we've told them all is that right now, we're not supporting
anyone," Charles Koch said in April. "We're telling them that if they want
our support, one way to get it is articulating a good message to help
Americans get a better understanding and a better appreciation of how
certain policies =E2=80=A6 will benefit them and will benefit all America."

The GOP field is still growing, and the Koch brothers seem content to let
the sifting process play out before placing their chips on a single
candidate.

"Only if somebody really stands out from the standpoint of their message
and what they would actually do to benefit America and has a chance a
decent chance of being elected, only then would we select one over the
others," Charles Koch told *USA Today*.

Charles and David Koch have matching fortunes of $51.3 billion dollars
each, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, ranking them equal at
number five in the world.
