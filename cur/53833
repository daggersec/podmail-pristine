John,

I wanted to see if you would have time to have a quick cup of coffee =
with a very good friend of mine?  His name is Michael LaRosa and he's =
Chris Matthews political producer on Hardball.  He got his start ten =
years ago as an intern in Hillary's finance shop and went on to work for =
Kelly Craighead at the Democracy Alliance before going to the Hill for a =
few years. He'd walk through fire for Hillary and would be a great hire =
on the campaign.  He's based in DC at the NBC News Bureau and would love =
to chat with you when you're in Washington.

Tony=
