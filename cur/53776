Just an interesting recollection of George's perspective back then.

Herb:=20

With the caveat that we're still refining it, let me tell you a little more=
 about the agenda for the 17-18 July.=20

I think you know that George wants to make a major financial contribution t=
o defeating Bush in 2004. The main purpose of the meeting is to develop a s=
trategy for spending that money in the most effective way. =20

The reason you and Marion should come is because you would contribute to th=
e quality of the discussion and because you'd learn a lot about the how the=
 upcoming election is going to play out. You might also find some guidance =
on how and even if you want to get involved in that.

We will likely start with an informal lunch on Thursday the 17th. At about =
2 p.m. we'll begin the program, leading off with a presentation by Tom Novi=
ck, and then moving into a structured discussion with all the participants =
facilitated by Anne Bartley, who I think you must have met at the AMI dinne=
r. We'll close after lunch on the 18th. The second day will be dedicated to=
 evaluating the previous day's presentations and identifying concrete next =
steps and the outline of a funding stratgey.

Novick is a political consultant we've hired to prepare an in-depth analysi=
s and evaluation of current efforts aimed at influencing the 2004 president=
ial election. We don't want to recreate the wheel. The goal of his analysis=
 will be to identify the most promising existing efforts that combine solid=
 strategies, the personnel to implement those strategies, and the ability t=
o influence the outcome of the election. (see attached). His written report=
 will be available prior to the meeting.

We'll also invite Steve Rosenthal, political director of the AFL-CIO, Ellen=
 Malcolm of Emily's List (now the country's largest PAC), and Carl Pope of =
the Sierra Club. These are leaders who have been involved in efforts to bri=
ng constituencies together to focus on defeating Bush, as opposed to concen=
trating on increasing the political clout of their particular issues.

Others we plan to invite are: Dorothy & Lewis Cullman, Dan Leeds, Rob McKay=
 (from the AMI dinner). We'll also invite David Rockefeller Jr. George may =
or may not invite Rob Glaser. The idea is to involve people who may be will=
ing to spend on the election but who also have something to contribute inte=
llectually to the discussion. It is not primarily a meeting to solicit cont=
ributions for a particular organization or even approach. Bob Boorstin and =
John Podesta are also on the list, but I assume will not attend if so doing=
 would compromise AMI.

George is motivated mostly by his intense dislike of the administration's a=
pproach to international relations, but he understands that this may not ne=
cessarily be a so-called "voting issue," thus the need to develop a strateg=
y. The premise is that there is a deep well of dissatisfaction with the dir=
ection in which Bush is moving the country. Some people are concerned about=
 the rollbacks of environmental protections, others about attack on civil l=
iberties or the administration's conservative social agenda. What is becomi=
ng increasingly apparent is that advocates will need to step back from thei=
r own issues to focus on the strategic goal of getting Bush et co. out of t=
he White House. (But because it's George's party, there will be a session, =
probably dinner on the 17th, devoted to examining the role foreign policy i=
n the elections)

I know it is a long trip for you to make and of course you should only do i=
t if you think it would be worthwhile. I guess my view is that though you w=
hile may not be an expert on political strategy you probably have innate go=
od judgment, which is rare, and a lens on domestic affairs that complements=
 George's knowledge of geopolitics. I know that you see AMI and AMI plus as=
 a long-term effort, and I agree that is important, but to quote George, qu=
oting Keynes, in the long run, we're all dead. Bush can do a lot of damage =
in the short term, namely 2004-2008. Whatever one's particular issues, it i=
s important to focus on the first step reform.

Let me know if you need more information, I will certainly keep you posted =
as the agenda crystallizes.

Best,=20
