The Value of McCain's Health Care Tax Credit =3D One Designer Jacket
<http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/09/17/health-jacket/>=20


The centerpiece of John McCain's health care plan is a tax credit worth
$2,500 for individuals. By coincidence, in her speech at the RNC two
weeks ago, Gov. Sarah Palin wore a jacket designed by Valentino Garavani
that cost $2,500
<http://www.nypost.com/seven/09172008/gossip/pagesix/sarah_has_secret_st
yle_team_129403.htm> .=20

Admittedly, McCain's health care tax credit is worth more than most
jackets. The problem is that it's worth far less than the cost of health
care for most Americans.=20

Individuals paid an average of $4,400
<http://facts.kff.org/chart.aspx?ch=3D172> for health care in 2007 -
nearly twice the value of McCain's credit. For families, McCain's credit
is $5,000 - which covers less than half of the $12,000
<http://facts.kff.org/chart.aspx?ch=3D172>  the average American family
paid for health care in 2007.=20

And unlike Gov. Palin's jacket, McCain's credits are not tailored. They
are one-size-fits-all. So if you're healthy, you should be in good
shape. But if you are sick, have a pre-existing condition, or endure a
medical emergency, once you exceed the value of the credit you are on
your own.=20

Which is why many health care experts agree than McCain's health care
plan boils down to this: don't get sick
