In response to the announcement of Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) as Mitt Romney's v=
ice-presidential nominee, the Center for American Progress Action Fund rele=
ased the following statements.

Neera Tanden, Counselor to the Center for American Progress Action Fund and=
 President of the Center for American Progress:


"Just like Sen. John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin and George H.W. Bush's =
selection of Dan Quayle, Mitt Romney has been cowed by the right wing into =
choosing an extreme vice presidential nominee who will alienate moderate vo=
ters. It's now clearer than ever that as president, Mitt Romney would end M=
edicare as we know it, and will raise taxes on middle class families by mor=
e than $2,000<http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/08/01/620561/tpc-romney=
-study-taxes/> in order to slash taxes on the wealthiest Americans.  While =
there is a lot that can be said about Paul Ryan's extreme views, more impor=
tant is what this choice says about Mitt Romney: that he is unwilling or un=
able to stand up to the far-right of his party and select a vice-presidenti=
al candidate that is both able to be president on day one and capable of go=
verning by reaching across the aisle."


Tom Perriello, President and CEO of the Center for American Progress Action=
 Fund:

=E2=80=9CMitt Romney and Paul Ryan=E2=80=99s extreme plan for America has d=
rawn the ire of everyone from Ryan=E2=80=99s own constituents<http://thinkp=
rogress.org/politics/2011/04/20/159895/paul-ryan-wealthy-tax-breaks/> to Ca=
tholic nuns<http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/08/08/658741/nuns-challen=
ge-romney/>. It=E2=80=99s ironic that Mitt Romney chose the USS Wisconsin f=
or the announcement, as both Romney and Ryan have put tax breaks for millio=
naires ahead of funding for our military. Their plan would not only end Med=
icare as we know it, it takes $500 billion from Medicare<http://thinkprogre=
ss.org/health/2011/04/06/172017/paul-ryan-medicare-cuts/> to give massive n=
ew tax breaks to millionaires and huge corporations like Big Oil. And their=
 plan would not only protect tax breaks for companies that ship American jo=
bs overseas, it would give companies huge new incentives to outsource Ameri=
can jobs<http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2012/07/hanlon_outsou=
rcing.html/> to countries like China and India."

Mitt Romney has picked 42-year-old Republican Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI) =
to be his running mate, the architect of the GOP budget, which the New York=
 Times has described as =E2=80=9Cthe most extreme<http://www.nytimes.com/20=
12/03/21/opinion/the-careless-house-budget.html?_r=3D1> budget plan passed =
by a house of Congress in modern times.=E2=80=9D Below are 10 things you sh=
ould know about Ryan and his policies:

1. Embraces extreme individualism. Ryanheaped praise<http://www.tnr.com/blo=
g/jonathan-chait/80552/paul-ryan-and-ayn-rand> on Ayn Rand, a 20th-century =
libertarian novelist best known for her philosophy that centered on the ide=
a that selfishness is =E2=80=9Cvirtue.=E2=80=9D Rand described altruism as =
=E2=80=9Cevil,=E2=80=9D condemned Christianity for advocating compassion fo=
r the poor, viewed the feminist movement as =E2=80=9Cphony,=E2=80=9D and ca=
lled Arabs =E2=80=9Calmost totally primitive savages. Though he publicly<ht=
tp://thinkprogress.org/politics/2012/04/26/471730/paul-ryan-ayn-rand/> reje=
cted<http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/297023/ryan-shrugged-robert-cos=
ta> =E2=80=9Cher philosophy=E2=80=9D in 2012, Ryan had professed himself a =
strong devotee. =E2=80=9CThe reason I got involved in public service, by an=
d large, if I had to credit one thinker, one person, it would be Ayn Rand<h=
ttp://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/80552/paul-ryan-and-ayn-rand>,=E2=80=
=9D he said at a D.C. gathering honoring the author of =E2=80=9CAtlas Shrug=
ged=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9CThe Fountainhead.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CI give out =
=E2=80=98Atlas Shrugged=E2=80=99 as Christmas presents, and I make all my i=
nterns read it. Well=E2=80=A6 I try to make my interns read it<http://www.w=

ayer_embedded]



2. Raises taxes on the middle class, cuts them for millionaires. Paul Ryan=
=E2=80=99s infamous budget =E2=80=94 which Romney embraced =E2=80=94 replac=
es<http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/06/20/502695/gop-budget-tax-study/=
> =E2=80=9Cthe current tax structure with two brackets =E2=80=94 25 percent=
 and 10 percent =E2=80=94 and cut the top rate from 35 percent.=E2=80=9D Fe=
deral tax collections would fall =E2=80=9Cby about $4.5 trillion over the n=
ext decade=E2=80=9D as a result and to avoid increasing the national debt, =
the budget proposes massive cuts in social programs and =E2=80=9Cspecial-in=
terest loopholes and tax shelters that litter the code.=E2=80=9D But 62 per=
cent of the savings would come from programs that benefit the lower- and mi=
ddle-classes, who would also experience a tax increase<http://www.offthecha=
rtsblog.org/ryan-budget-would-raise-some-taxes-guess-who-gets-hit/>. That=
=E2=80=99s because while Ryan =E2=80=9Cwould extend the Bush tax cuts, whic=
h are due to expire at the end of this year, he would not extend President =
Obama=E2=80=99s tax cuts for those with the lowest incomes, which will expi=
re at the same time.=E2=80=9D Households =E2=80=9Cearning more than $1 mill=
ion a year, meanwhile, could see a net tax cut of about $300,000 annually<h=
ttp://www.washingtonpost.com/middle-class-would-face-higher-taxes-under-rep=
ublican-plan/2012/06/19/gJQAD4auoV_story.html>.=E2=80=9D





Audiences have booed Ryan for the unfair distribution:

yer_embedded]



3. Dramatically increases Medicare costs for seniors, increases eligibility=
 age. Ryan=E2=80=99s latest budget transforms the existing Medicare benefit=
, in which government provides seniors with a guaranteed benefit, into a =
=E2=80=9Cpremium support=E2=80=9D system. All future retirees would receive=
 a government contribution to purchase insurance from an exchange of privat=
e plans or traditional fee-for-service Medicare. But since the premium supp=
ort voucher does not keep up with increasing health care costs, the Congres=
sional Budget Offices estimates that new beneficiaries could pay up to $1,2=
00 more by 2030<http://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/03-=
20-Ryan_Specified_Paths_2.pdf> and more than $5,900 more by 2050. A recent =
study also found that had the plan been implemented in 2009, 24 million ben=
eficiares enrolled in the program would have paid higher premiums<http://th=
inkprogress.org/health/2012/08/01/622031/study-seniors-would-pay-more-for-m=
edicare-under-republican-backed-plan/> to maintain their choice of plan and=
 doctors. Ryan would also raise Medicare=E2=80=99s age of eligibility to 67=
.

4. Leaves Social Security to the whims of Wall Street. In September of 2011=
, Ryan agreed with Rick Perry=E2=80=99s characterization of Social Security=
 as a =E2=80=9CPonzi scheme<http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/new=
s/182711-rep-ryan-rick-perry-is-right-on-social-security>=E2=80=9D and has =
advocated for privatizing the retirement benefit and investing it in stocks=
 and bonds since 2005<http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/07/30/609001/pa=
ul-ryanhistory-social-securit/>. Conservatives claim that this would =E2=80=
=9Coutperform the current formula based on wages earned and overall wage ap=
preciation,=E2=80=9D but the economic crisis of 2008 should serve as a wake=
-up call for policymakers who seek to hinge Americans=E2=80=99 retirement o=
n the stock market. In fact, =E2=80=9Ca person with a private Social Securi=
ty account similar to what President George W. Bush proposed in 2005=E2=80=
=B3 would have lost much of their retirement savings<http://wonkroom.thinkp=
rogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/ss_report.pdf>.

5. Budget would result in 4.1 million lost jobs in 2 years. Ryan=E2=80=99s =
budget calls for massive reductions in government spending, and has propose=
d cutting discretionary programs by about $120 billion over the next two ye=
ars and mandatory programs by $284 billion. The Economic Policy Institute e=
stimates<http://www.epi.org/blog/paul-ryan-budget-discretionary-cuts-cost-j=
obs/> that this would suck demand out of the economy and =E2=80=9Creduce em=
ployment by 1.3 million jobs in fiscal 2013 and 2.8 million jobs in fiscal =
2014, relative to current budget policies.=E2=80=9D

6. Eliminates Pell Grants for more more than 1 million students. Ryan=E2=80=
=99s budget claims<http://thinkprogress.org/education/2012/03/28/454043/hou=
segot-budget-one-million-pell-grants/> both that rising financial aid is dr=
iving college tuition costs upward and that Pell Grants, which help cover t=
uition costs for low-income Americans, don=E2=80=99t go to the =E2=80=9Ctru=
ly needy.=E2=80=9D So he cuts the Pell Grant program by $200 billion, which=
 could =E2=80=9Cultimately knock more than one million students<http://www.=
huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/pell-grants-paul-ryan-budget_n_1383178.html?r=
ef=3Deducation> off=E2=80=9D the program over the next 10 years.

7. Keeps $40 billion in subsidies for Big Oil. In 2011, Ryan joined all Hou=
se Republicans and 13 Democrats in his vote<http://www.govtrack.us/congress=
/vote.xpd?vote=3Dh2011-153> to keep Big Oil tax loopholes as part of the FY=
 2011 spending bill. His budget would retain<http://www.americanprogress.or=
g/issues/2012/03/ryan_big_oil.html> a decade=E2=80=99s worth of oil tax bre=
aks worth $40 billion, while cutting =E2=80=9Cbillions of dollars from inve=
stments to develop alternative fuels and clean energy technologies that wou=
ld serve as substitutes for oil.=E2=80=9D For instance, it =E2=80=9Ccalls f=
or a $3 billion cut in energy programs in FY 2013 alone=E2=80=9D and would =
spend only $150 million over five years =E2=80=94 or 20 percent of what was=
 invested in 2012 =E2=80=94 on energy programs.

8. Family stands to benefit from oil subsidies. Ryan =E2=80=9Cand his wife,=
 Janna, own stakes<http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/06/17/247570/paul-=
ryan-family-beneft-subsidies-for-big-oil-in-his-budget/> in four family com=
panies that lease land in Texas and Oklahoma to the very energy companies t=
hat benefit from the tax subsidies in Ryan=E2=80=99s budget plan,=E2=80=9D =
the Daily Beast reported<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/06/17/p=
aul-ryan-s-shrewd-budget-payday-congressman-could-benefit-from-tax-breaks-h=
e-proposes.html> in June of 2011. =E2=80=9CRyan=E2=80=99s father-in-law, Da=
niel Little, who runs the companies, told Newsweek and The Daily Beast that=
 the family companies are currently leasing the land for mining and drillin=
g to energy giants such as Chesapeake Energy, Devon, and XTO Energy, a rece=
ntly acquired subsidiary of ExxonMobil.=E2=80=9D

9. Claimed Romneycare has led to =E2=80=9Crationing and benefit cuts.=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99m not a fan of [Romney's health care reform] system,=
=E2=80=9D Ryan told C-SPAN<http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/paul-rya=
n-dinged-romneycare-in-2010-im-not-a-fa> in 2010. He argued that government=
 is rationing care in the state and claimed that people are =E2=80=9Cseeing=
 the system bursting by the seams, they=E2=80=99re seeing premium increases=
, rationing and benefit cuts.=E2=80=9D He called the system =E2=80=9Ca fata=
l conceit=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cunsustainable.=E2=80=9D Watch it:

[embedded video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DEnYlx3Rh-Lg&feature=3Dpla=
yer_embedded]



10. Believes that Romneycare is =E2=80=9Cnot that dissimilar to Obamacare.=
=E2=80=9D Though Romney has gone to great lengths to distinguish his Massac=
husetts health care law from Obamacare, Romney doesn=E2=80=99t see the diff=
erence. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s not that dissimilar<http://www.weeklystandard=

<p>&quot;Just like Sen. John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin and George H.W.=
&nbsp;Bush's selection of Dan Quayle, Mitt Romney has been cowed by the rig=
ht wing into choosing an extreme vice presidential nominee who will alienat=
e moderate voters. It's now clearer than ever
 that as president, Mitt Romney would end Medicare as we know it, and will =
<a href=3D"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/08/01/620561/tpc-romney-st=
udy-taxes/">
raise taxes on middle class families by more than $2,000</a> in order to sl=
ash taxes on the wealthiest Americans.&nbsp; While there is a lot that can =
be said about Paul Ryan's extreme views, more important is what this choice=
 says about Mitt Romney: that he is unwilling
 or unable to stand up to the far-right of his party and select a vice-pres=
idential candidate that is both able to be president on day one and capable=
 of governing by reaching across the aisle.&quot;</p>
