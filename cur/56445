John --

I'm so proud to endorse my friend General John Douglass. We need more =
veterans in Congress, especially a flag officer like John who has worked =
with leaders in both parties for the good of our nation.

From our time in uniform, John and I have a unique understanding about how =
much more we can do to better serve our returning heroes. That is why more =
than two dozen high level national security leaders are standing with =
John, like former Defense Secretary Bill Perry, former Navy Secretary =
Richard Danzig and former Congressman and 3-star Navy Admiral Joe Sestak.

Now John's campaign is facing the deadline for their GOTV budget on =
Sunday, but they are just $8,552 short. This could be make or break -- can =
you click here and help me, help John by donating today?=20

I'm eager to see John Douglass represent Virginia's 5th District, because =
I know he will do the right things for the right reasons. Please donate =
now.

Keep up the fight.

- General Wes Clark (USA Ret.)
Paid for by John Douglass for Congress
