John --

This Saturday, October 23rd, OFA supporters will be gathering at our DC =
headquarters for a get out the vote kick off.

It's more than a phone bank -- we'll get the scoop on the national picture =
from OFA's targeting team, and then get fired up with a speech by OFA =
deputy director Jeremy Bird.

Then, we'll call thousands of voters in key districts across the country =
to make sure they have plans to vote between now and November 2nd.

Can you join in?

Here are the details:

    What: Get out the vote kick off

    Where: Democratic Party Headquarters
    430 S. Capitol St. SE=20
    Washington, DC 20003

    When: Saturday, October 23rd
    Remarks at 9:45 a.m.
    Shifts from 9:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

Yes, I can make it: http://dc.barackobama.com/DCphonebank?override_wrapper=

Sorry, I can't make it: http://dc.barackobama.com/CantMakeIt

Saturday marks just 10 days until the November elections -- and with early =
voting already started in a majority of states, there's no time to waste =
contacting the voters who could make the difference between losing and =
moving America forward.
