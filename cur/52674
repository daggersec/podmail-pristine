Hey John, we'd be happy to try to meet up.

I'm hosting Penny Pritzker that night and just need to find out if it's
going to be early or late.

We'll be back to you asap.

I'm in LA on Wednesday late afternoon for the bundler roadshow.  Don't know
whether either of you are attending that, but I was wondering whether you
had any interest in getting together for a quick meeting or a drink
afterwards.

The event is in Beverly Hills and finishes around 6:45 pm.  Any chance?

Eryn has more details if you need them.

Thanks,
John
