Dear John,

Last Thursday, Big Oil and Dirty Coal and their allies in the Senate prevailed in
their campaign to block action on comprehensive global warming legislation.

Despite the fact that the majority of Americans support taking action, energy
and climate reform has fallen victim for now to an unprecedented disinformation and smear campaign from Big Oil, Dirty Coal and their army of corporate lobbyists.

These big polluters rallied the Republican leadership, and scared off weak-willed Democrats like Senator Blanche Lincoln and Senator Ben Nelson.

On Friday, I sent you the message below to let you know where we stand. Now, as we enter the August recess, here's how we're going to stop Big Oil from killing the global warming policies for good:

A group of furious LCV supporters has offered up to $40,000 to match every contribution given before August 2nd, dollar-for-dollar, to overcome Big Oil's influence in Washington, D.C. Your gift will get ads on the air to counter Big Oil's lies - and it will make sure the pro-environment uproar is heard in critical battleground states.

Give today and have your gift doubled >>

With your help, we can show senators who stood with Big Oil that there is a
political price to pay for choosing oil profits over a clean energy future. 

Thank you for standing with us at this difficult time - and thank you for joining us as we move forward to beat Big Oil.

Sincerely,

Gene Karpinski
President
League of Conservation Voters



Dear John,

As an LCV member and supporter, I wanted you to be among the first to hear our thoughts about some disheartening news.

As you may have heard, we learned that the U.S. Senate will not take up comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation prior to the August recess. Even more distressing, it's very unlikely the Senate will push for a comprehensive bill at all this year.

It's deeply disappointing that Big Oil, Dirty Coal and their allies in the Senate, led by the Republican leadership, continue to stand in the way of creating a clean energy economy that creates jobs, makes America more energy independent and protects the planet. The twin challenges of building a clean energy economy and addressing global warming are too important to fail.

Your support on this issue has been the backbone of our work. Thank you for standing with us over the past two years as we've pushed to get a  comprehensive clean energy and climate bill enacted into law. With your help, we worked hard to ensure that the House passed the landmark American Clean Energy and Security Act last year, and we have been working round the clock to get the Senate to pass a comprehensive bill. The Senate is expected to vote on a bill addressing the Gulf catastrophe next week, but that is clearly no substitute for passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill.

We will not give up and will keep the pressure on to act this year while senators are home in August. A critically important part of our fight will be preserving the tools the EPA currently has under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions from our nation's largest and dirtiest emitters.

As we look toward the November elections, it's clear that we need to work harder than ever to protect our friends in the House of Representatives who worked hard to pass the American Clean Energy and Security Act last year and send new pro-environment champions to the Senate.

The fight to create new clean energy jobs and solve the climate crisis will continue -- in this Congress, in the states and at the EPA. Please donate today.
