About Medicare.  One thing she said that I wanted to relay was her view tha=
t the argument against doing it was a political one, and that everyone thou=
ght it was the right policy.  I pushed back hard on that given how vulnerab=
le that population is.  Anyway - she seemed to think that even John thought=
 doing this was more of a  political problem than a question of it being ba=
d policy.   So guess we still need to hit policy argument too.=
