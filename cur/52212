John --=20

Yesterday's disappointing election results show deep discontent with the =
pace of change. I know the OFA community and the President share that =
frustration.

We also saw what we knew to be true all along: Any change worth making is =
hard and will be fought at every turn. While it doesn't take away the =
sting of this loss, there is no road to real change without setbacks along =
the way.

We could have simply sought to do things that were easy, that wouldn't =
stir up controversy. But changes that aren't controversial rarely solve =
the problem.

Our country continues to face the same fundamental challenges it faced =
yesterday. Our health care system still needs reform. Wall Street still =
needs to be held accountable. We still need to create good jobs. And we =
still need to continue building a clean energy economy.

The President isn't walking away from these challenges. In fact, his =
determination and resolve are only stronger. We must match that commitment =
with our own.

But it won't be easy. Real change never is. For that reason, I am grateful =
you're part of this fight with us.

Thank you,

Mitch
