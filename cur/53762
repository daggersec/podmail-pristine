Economic History Shows Clearly that Tax Cuts for Rich Hurt the  Economy=20

Right-wing politicians  and pundits carry on repeatedly about how wrong it=
=20
would be to raise taxes on  the rich in a time of economic downturn. Wrong.=
=20
Just because you  repeat something over and over doesn=92t make it true.  I=
n=20
fact there is a body of empirical,  historical evidence that proves clearly=
=20
that tax cuts for the rich not only do  nothing to spur economic growth =96=
=20
they actually do substantial damage to the  prospects for economic growth. =
=20
First let=92s look at  the proposition that high taxes on the wealthy stifl=
e=20
economic growth. In the  last century, marginal tax rates on the rich were=
=20
their highest during World War  II =96 when the wealthy were called upon to=
=20
help finance the war effort. During  World War II, the tax bite on wealthy=
=20
Americans was close to punitive (the  highest bracket was 91%).  But that  =
didn=92
t hurt the economy; far from it.  By war=92s end, Americans were rolling in=
=20
cash.  The average weekly pay rose 83% between  1940 and 1945.  Many famili=
es=20
had  their first discretionary income.=20
In fact, this period =96  and the expansionary fiscal policy that helped=20
finance the war =96 led to the  longest sustained period of growth in Ameri=
can=20
history and created the American  middle class. =20
Or we can turn  to the tax policy of the Clinton Administration.  In 1993,=
=20
President Bill Clinton proposed  a budget that raised taxes on the rich. =
=20
Republicans predicted that its passage would lead to economic doom.  They=
=20
argued that the Clinton tax increase on  the rich would lead to economic=20
stagnation and unemployment.  Instead, of course, the Clinton  Administrati=
on=20
created 22.5 million jobs, of which 20.7 million =96 or 92% -- were  in the=
 private=20
sector.  His economic  policy eliminated the Federal deficit and left his=
=20
successor =96 George Bush =96  with budget surpluses projected as far as th=
e eye=20
could see.=20
So history tells  us pretty clearly that increased taxes for the rich don=
=92t=20
hinder economic  growth.  Now let=92s look at  historical evidence that the=
=20
opposite proposition is true =96 whether tax cuts for  the rich actually=20
promote economic growth.  =20
To see the fallacy in  that argument all you have to do is go back to the=
=20
Bush Administration.  For eight years, George Bush and the  Republicans=20
lowered taxes for the wealthy and cut back the regulation of big  corporati=
ons=20
and Wall Street =96 all based on the premise that these two policies  would=
=20
benefit the economy.  =20
The results are there  for everyone to see.  =20
The New York Times  reported last year that, =93For the first time since th=
e=20
Depression, the American  economy has added virtually no jobs in the privat=
e=20
sector over a 10-year  period.  The total number of jobs  has grown a bit,=
=20
but that is only because of government hiring.=94  =20
In fact, in the eight  years when George Bush and the Republicans in=20
Congress passed two massive tax  cuts, we saw a massive, secular decline in=
 the=20
creation of private  sector jobs. =20
Of course it won=92t  surprise anyone that this decline was led by the=20
reduction of American  manufacturing jobs.  There was a  decline of 3.7% in=
=20
overall manufacturing jobs in the United States  over the last decade endin=
g in=20
2009.  =20
Remember that we=92re talking  here about no increase whatsoever in private=
=20
sector jobs =96 zero increase in  actual jobs -- even as the population of =
the=20
United States  has grown.  Economists tell us that  the economy must create=
=20
150,000 new jobs each month just to stay even with  population growth.  =20
In fact, there is  absolutely no evidence in the economic history of the=20
last century that tax cuts  for the rich increase economic growth.  But the=
re=20
is evidence that they actually hurt prospects for economic  growth =96 both=
 in=20
the short and long run. =20
Tax cuts for the wealthy function to reduce  economic growth in two=20
specific ways: =20
First,  they amplify the tendency of income and wealth to concentrate in a=
=20
small segment  of the population.  =20
Throughout the  entire period of Republican rule, all  of the economic=20
growth was siphoned off to the top two percent.  Real wages stagnated, and=
=20
continued  growth in the Gross Domestic Product was fueled =96 for a time -=
- by an=20
expanding  credit bubble that ultimately burst.   =20
The problem is that to  be sustained over time, economic growth must be=20
widely shared.  Otherwise, demand for new products and  services stagnates;=
=20
there is no incentive for businesses to invest, and economic  growth itself=
=20
stalls.  =20
Fundamentally,  economic growth is about the development of processes and=
=20
technologies that  increase productivity.  But these do  not occur when=20
wealth is concentrated and labor prices are cheap.  They occur when new gro=
wth is=20
shared and  wages are high.=20
A high-wage  economy leads to major long-term economic dividends because:=
=20
=B7       It incentivizes  companies to invest in higher-productivity=20
technologies that increase overall  productivity and provide real economic =
growth.=20
=B7       It creates customers  with spending power to drive economic growt=
h.=20
 There is a natural tendency of market  economies to use low-cost labor and=
=20
increase profits.  That=92s good for each company=92s bottom  line, but it=
=20
kills off the goose that lays the golden egg by reducing the buying  power =
of=20
its ultimate customers =96 the people who work for all the companies in  th=
e=20
economy combined.=20
Cutting taxes for the wealthy simply transfers more and more wealth into =
=20
the hands of fewer and fewer people and helps fuel an economic imbalance th=
at=20
 causes an economy to stall. =20
Second, tax cuts for the rich starve the  public sector of funds that are=
=20
necessary to assure long-term growth.  Tax cut activist Grover Norquist was=
 =20
quite explicit when he championed the Bush tax cuts, that he intended to=20
deprive  government of resources so it could be =93drowned in a bathtub.=94=
=20
Historically, tax cuts for the rich have been used =96 quite intentionally =
 =96
 to create deficits that make it politically difficult for government to do=
=20
 three things that are critical to sustaining growth over the long  run:=20
* Tax cuts for the rich  shortchange investments in education that are the=
=20
major engine of most long-term  increases in productivity, and hence real=
=20
economic growth.  Education is the major factor that makes  the workforce m=
ore=20
productive.  It  underlies all of the scientific discoveries and=20
technological advancement that  boost productivity. America=92s commitment =
to universal =20
public education is responsible =96 more than any other single factor =96 f=
or=20
our  economic success over the last century. And more than any other factor=
,=20
the  massive growth of the Chinese economy is rooted in the exponential=20
increased  level of its people=92s education. The Chinese are turning out m=
ore=20
graduate  engineers each year than the rest of the industrial world combine=
d.=20
Starving our  schools and universities will do more damage to our long-term=
=20
economic prospects  than anything else we could do.  Yet  it is a direct=20
consequence of tax cuts for the rich.=20
* Tax cuts for the rich restrict  government=92s ability to invest in new=
=20
public infrastructure that is another  major factor in assuring long-term=
=20
growth.  Roads, rail lines, airports, sewer and  water systems, sanitation,=
=20
public health =96 all of these are critical foundations  for economic succe=
ss.  Yet=20
over the  Bush years, all of them were starved for cash =96 both by Bush=92=
s=20
wars and by his  tax cuts for the rich.=20
* The deficits created by tax  cuts for the rich make it politically=20
difficult for the Government to engage in  precisely the kind of economic f=
iscal=20
stimulus that is necessary to offset the  reduced levels of economic demand=
=20
that occur during recessions.  When Barack Obama became President he  was=
=20
confronted with a three trillion dollar deficit in economic demand that lef=
t =20
massive portions of our plant and equipment =96 and millions of workers idl=
e =96=20
 producing nothing to contribute to our gross domestic product.=20
Unfortunately, he  also inherited a budget deficit that had been exploded b=
y eight=20
years of tax  cuts for the rich =96 and ultimately by the recession itself.=
=20
Obama convinced  Congress to pass a $730 billion stimulus package that=20
saved 3.5 million  jobs.  What was needed to seriously  jumpstart private s=
ector=20
economic growth was more than twice that amount. But  Republicans were able=
=20
to use the deficit -- that had resulted from eight years  of tax cuts for=
=20
the rich and two wars -- as a reason to limit the size of that  stimulus. =
=20
That turned out to be  good politics for the Republicans, since it helped k=
eep=20
millions of people  unemployed, who then blamed the Democrats for failing=
=20
to put them back to  work.  But it was terrible for the  economy and for ou=
r=20
collective well-being as a nation.=20
And just in case you hear someone say that a dollar spent on tax cuts to =
=20
the rich is a good way to stimulate the economy, here=92s a fact from Mark=
=20
Zandi,  Chief Economist for Moody=92s.com, who was also an economic adviser=
 to=20
John  McCain:=20
For every dollar  spent on making the Bush tax cuts permanent, you get $.29=
=20
of increase in the  GDP.  For every dollar spent to  extend unemployment=20
benefits you get $1.64 increase in the GDP.   In other words, a dollar spen=
t=20
on  unemployment compensation gets 5.6 times more boost to the GDP than a t=
ax=20
cut  for the rich. =20
The reason is simple.  When  you=92re in a recession, the problem is that=
=20
demand is too low, so spending that  increases demand really boosts the=20
economy, since it creates demand that entices  businesses to hire people wh=
o then=20
spend more money and create more jobs -- and  so on.=20
But when you give tax breaks to the rich, they don=92t spend most of those =
=20
breaks like a family that needs unemployment.  They save and invest a=20
substantial  portion.  But in a recession you  don=92t need more savings or=
=20
investment, you need more demand.=20
* Finally, the deficits caused by tax cuts  for the rich not only prevent=
=20
the government from doing what=92s necessary in  times of recession to rest=
art=20
economic growth.  In times of prosperity, they cause  deficits that put=20
pressure on interest rates and choke off private sector  investment. In oth=
er=20
words, they tend to damage the economy at pretty much any  time in the=20
economic cycle.=20
Of course tax  cuts for the rich are particularly outrageous right now =96=
=20
when middle class  incomes have stagnated for decades and the percentage of=
=20
wealth controlled by  the top two percent of the population is higher than=
=20
anytime since  pre-depression 1928. =20
But that=92s  exactly what those =93deficit hawks=94 in the Republican Part=
y are=20
proposing.  After running around the country for  months campaigning about =
=93
runaway deficits=94 they propose to borrow $700 billion  additional dollars=
=20
to finance more tax cuts for the rich. And at the same time,  last week the=
=20
Republicans voted in the House to block extension of unemployment  benefits=
=20
that really would boost economic growth.  They are happy to borrow more mon=
ey=20
to  make their rich patrons richer =96 but they refuse to borrow any money =
to=20
provide  unemployment benefits that not only allow middle class families=20
who have lost  their jobs through no fault of their own to keep their heads=
=20
above water, but  actually do turbocharged the economy. =20
The Republican proposal to make the rich richer is just plain wrong.  If=20
they succeed, the price will be paid  by our children, who must pay the deb=
t. =20
But it will also be paid by all of us today in the form of lost goods and =
=20
services that will never be created because so many people who are willing=
=20
and  able to work, can=92t find jobs.=20
