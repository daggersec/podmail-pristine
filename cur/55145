<!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="content" -->Friend -- did you see what Joe Scarborough said
about Ken Cuccinelli yesterday?

"[Cuccinelli] has said more things that will offend the
voters that swing elections than is humanly possible."

And Scarborough's not alone -- Politico reported that
Cuccinelli got into a heated exchange with two top
Republican donors at a closed door meeting last weekend.
Their concern? They think Cuccinelli is out of the
mainstream.

But because many Virginians don't know how radical Ken
Cuccinelli really is, the most recent polls show that the
race is still tied.

Will you make a $5 donation to Terry McAuliffe
before tomorrow's fundraising deadline?

We're still $34,342 away from our $50,000 fundraising goal,
and it's critical that we have enough resources to make
voters aware of Ken Cuccinelli's extreme beliefs.

We simply can't afford to stay on the sidelines.

That's why I'm counting on you to make a $5
donation today:

http://finance.terry2013.com/ourgoal

Thanks for your continued support of Terry,

Andrew Smith 
Finance Director 
Terry McAuliffe for Governor
