Subject: Area Agencies on Aging

All,

This is an idea on how to better get a bead on how sequestration is impacti=
ng people at the local level-a task that I think we have all found more tha=
n daunting. I am working on a project that examines why White, rural, elder=
ly, poor people support candidates who call for entitlement reform. I am lo=
oking at economic conditions, demography and voting behavior in one small V=
irginia County as a laboratory on this subject. In the process I have stumb=
led across Mountain Empire Older Citizens or MEOC which is the Area Agency =
on Aging for Southwest Virginia
http://www.tricities.com/news/local/article_1dd93848-f801-11e2-9542-001a4bc=
f6878.html?mode=3Djqm

The problem with translating federal budget cuts to the street level is tha=
t the programs that we deal with in Washington are in many cases transforme=
d into a different identity before they become visible to people at the com=
munity level. AAOAs are a perfect example. These are C4s set up in the late=
 60s and early 70s that manage a multitude of federal initiatives. A second=
 group of similar organizations are Community Action Agencies they manage s=
imilar and in some instances the same programs but tend to be more targeted=
 on the non senior population.

MEOC has an enormous presence in Southwest Virginia. For one thing, as many=
 as 50 percent of households in some counties are elderly or disabled. For =
another, MEOC has a very good reputation for solving problems, delivering s=
ervices and basically winning the gratitude of not only those in need but t=
he friends, neighbors and relatives of such people.

Organizations like MEOC are heavily dependent on federal money. If you look=
 at their website, it is clear that in addition to the federal grants that =
they get for being an AAOA, they get LIHEAP funds, grants for running congr=
egate meals, meals on wheels, senior transportation systems, Retired Senior=
 Volunteers, home health care and probably a host of other programs. In add=
ition they get money from the state of Virginia, local county boards and pr=
ivate contributions.

While the mission of such organizations is rooted in progressive legislatio=
n and  the programs they run have grown and prospered as a result of the ef=
forts of Democrats in federal government and most people who run them or wo=
rk for them are on the progressive side of the spectrum (even in areas like=
 Southwest Virginia) they walk a very fine line politically. They can not f=
unction without having a positive relationship with state legislators, coun=
ty boards and even members of Congress who may be overwhelmingly Republican=
. As a result they are not likely to talk about sequestration or other cuts=
 in a way that is politically charged or directed at Republican House membe=
rs even if they are personally convinced that those members are to blame fo=
r reduced funding that they find very problematic.

That is not to say, however, that they would not be pleased if someone else=
 did that in a way that did not leave their finger prints on the allegation=
s. The problem is that there are a lot of these organizations across the co=
untry but if we want to turn the heat upon members who support sequestratio=
n we only need to deal with the ones in those districts and I think we coul=
d have a real impact if we dealt with only a portion of them.

My idea is that we call them, ask for an interview on the effects of seques=
tration at the local level in a very neutral, service directed way and try =
to get a complete listing of service cut backs at a particular agency. We n=
eed to developing and interview outline so that the people conducting the i=
nterview probe in the right areas enough to get a full picture. Once that i=
s done much of the interviewing could be conducted by good interns.

AAOAs activities are favorite news stories for local papers. A story tying =
Washington gridlock to numerous reductions in services to the elderly would=
 be a natural for many of them-even if the lean Republican-which most do.
