As you may know, the German Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Dr. Dirk Niebel, sent a letter to WJC on Feb 17, suggesting a meeting to discuss partnership. [This is the arm of the German government that funds development projects overseas.] As follow-up, I had a call today with the Minister's folks. Below are key points from our discussion:


*         Their priorities are education, entrepreneurship, and clean energy, and their priority regions are Africa and Asia. We honed in on three areas of overlapping interest: (1) CDI, (2) CCI in cities, and (3) islands' adaptation to climate change.


*         They can fund our work but only as a co-funder; they would provide one-to-one matching if we can find another donor(s).


*         Besides funding for CDI, we also discussed them sharing with us the lessons they have learned on value-add agri-businesses elsewhere in Africa.


*         Next steps are for us to send short summaries of CDI and CCI in cities, as well as more detailed descriptions of these programs and their budgets, not framed as funding requests yet, but as documents their experts can review to see if and how they want to discuss in more detail how they could support us. They like the idea of CDI presenting an alternate model for agricultural development that could have systemic impact in Africa.


*         We are planning to speak again in mid-April to get their feedback on the documents we send. They also said they'll send us a list of their priority countries in Africa for agriculture programs. I tried to focus them on Malawi and Tanzania but am not sure they are really interested in those two countries.

As background, we do not currently receive funding from the German Government.

Hope this helps,
Ami
