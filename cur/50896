Turned in my keys to my septuagenarian landlord Al earlier this morning.
He's a huge HRC fan and will definitely vote for her, but he said he's
frustrated by how managed her public persona still seems.  He said, "I want
to see more like that Chipotle stop, or the Brooklyn video where she got
out and surprised people," and more or less that now is the time to
let people need to know that she's "friendly and warm.  I can't tell that
from the way the media is talking about her, and all this distraction about
the foundation.  Get her out there spontaneously more... but I don't blame
her for ignoring the press.  They deserve it."

Just passing along since Al is a smart guy, very progressive, and thought
you might want to hear from the ground.  If he feels this way (as I've
heard so many others say recently), I imagine the implications for
undecideds.
