Parties Do Battle Over U.S. Forces' Future in Iraq (Washington Post 6/12/08)

Congressional Democrats yesterday opened fire on comments from Republicans
-- including presumptive GOP nominee John McCain -- that equate the U.S.
military's future in Iraq to the presence of U.S. bases in Germany, Japan
and South Korea. The issue erupted after Sen. McCain (R-Ariz.) said in an
interview with NBC's "Today" show that the timetable for U.S. forces to come
home from Iraq is not of great concern...

ginning up a full-force political attack. Mr. McCain... said he knows how
precious American military lives are, and that the daylong brouhaha over a

accept a series of face-to-face town-hall meetings.

Lieberman: Iraqi Opposition To U.S. Security Agreement Is 'A Sign Of Our

The Bush administration is currently trying to push Iraqis into accepting a

occupation of Iraq indefinitely." The U.S. demands include nearly 60
permanent bases in Iraq, immunity for foreign contractors, and control over

presidency would effectively constitute a third Bush term, saying recently
that he has "disagreed strongly with the Bush administration" on Iraq. But
McCain took a very different stance in June 2005 when he told Tim Russert
that he has "been totally in agreement and support of President Bush" on
"the transcendent issues":

implores his audiences "to make sure that we elect John McCain the 44th
President of the United States." But worried about being labeled a third
Bush term, the McCain campaign has made strides to distance the candidate
from Cheney by blasting "Vice President Cheney's energy bill."
