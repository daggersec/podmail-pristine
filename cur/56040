Here is the McSame spot. Comments are from the ad makers.


"After a lot of experimentation, one of our three visual effects
turned out so much better than the other two that we decided to just
use that one and get it done.  I am sending you four links below.
The first is the version that I think you should use for testing.
Here it is:

http://pistolerapost2.com/zimmark/mcsame/mcsame03a.mov

Here is the same spot with a slightly different ending.  The only
change is in the title card at the end where we use two pictures of
Bush and McCain to create the illusion of them hugging.  Here it is:

http://pistolerapost2.com/zimmark/mcsame/mcsame03.mov

The next link is version #1 above but with the long disclaimer at the
end.

http://pistolerapost2.com/zimmark/mcsame/mcsamel03a.mov

And the last link below is version #2 with the longer disclaimer.

http://pistolerapost2.com/zimmark/mcsame/mcsamel03.mov

You can tell us which version you like best and we will make the
necessary compressions on Monday and get them to the people doing the
web testing.  We can also tweak the spot if you have other criticisms.'
