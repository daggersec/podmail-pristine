As Tom knows from our conversations, I am a strong supporter of this =
proposal.  And if that means we don't work with some of the big-name, =
big-dollar admakers, I consider that an added bonus. =20

I am nauseated by the notion that Shrum has a villa in Tuscany while =
young soldiers are bleeding in Iraq because of his goddam incompetence.

We'd offer a flat fee for each ad made. What it does is opens the
market to a new generation of ad creators who want to come up with
bigger ideas and make a name for themselves. It takes financial
considerations out of strategic planning. I agree there is a risk we
lose some of the bigger talents who only want to work for a big
commission but maybe we don't need them. The donors really despise
paying commissions to media consultants for cut and paste advertising.
That is what I'm trying to address here.
