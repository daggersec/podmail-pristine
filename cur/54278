I'm announcing a big opportunity: Chip in to the LCV Victory Fund today, an=
d your donation will be TRIPLED to defeat the Dirty Dozen: http://action.lc=
v.org/site/R?i=3Docu9Cs4JvWimfgKFBeri9w .

John,

The LCV Victory Fund needs $150,000 to beat the Dirty Dozen on Election Day=
. Between now and November 2, all contributions to make it happen will be T=
RIPLED. Chip in: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D-qky1v9dEuvX-tTlqVs8Rg .

Let me be blunt: A handful of votes are all that stand between corporate po=
lluters and complete control of Congress.

That's why Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers are pumping money into races fro=
m Massachusetts to Montana - attempting to protect their anti-environmental=
, anti-science cronies, including members of LCV's Dirty Dozen. And it's wo=
rking - polls show
razor-thin margins in races across the country.

If they win, we'll wake up on November 7th to a world where polluters get a=
 free pass and investments in clean energy get slashed. I know you won't le=
t that happen. With so many races neck and neck, we need the LCV's voter ou=
treach programs in full force: knocking on doors for Elizabeth Warren, send=
ing targeted mail for Chris Murphy, and getting environmentalists to vote f=
or Jon Tester.

I know we can win - but they'll need our support, John. For a limited time =
only, every gift you make to support the LCV Victory Fund's voter outreach =
efforts will be TRIPLED. There's truly no better time to give.

Help kick out the Dirty Dozen and other anti-environmental candidates with =
your gift to the LCV Victory Fund. Your donation will have THREE TIMES the =
impact: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DWfyxvgC0KnR7zkMLOG5T_Q .

From now until Election Day, the messaging and ad war is in high gear as ca=
mpaigns try to sway undecided voters. You know as well as I do that Big Oil=
's favorite candidates have the funding to blanket the airwaves. Only LCV V=
ictory Fund - with its strategic and aggressive electoral strategies - can =
set the record straight.

And it's a good thing, too, because we're fighting in some tough races:

*  Take Massachusetts, where Elizabeth Warren is neck and neck with anti-en=
vironmental opponent Sen. Scott Brown, who has opposed vital clean air prot=
ections and cutting tax breaks for the oil industry. The race is a toss-up,=
 and our efforts over the next few weeks could determine the winner.

*  Then there's Connecticut Senate candidate Linda McMahon, who has actuall=
y said she'd be willing to consider dismantling the EPA. But her opponent, =
Rep. Chris Murphy, has an LCV lifetime environmental score of 98 percent.

*  Or think of Rep. Dennis Rehberg of Montana, a huge ally of the oil indus=
try who's challenging clean-energy champion Sen. Jon Tester. LCV's projecti=
ons show that this race could come down to a few thousand votes - a margin =
that's just too close for comfort.

Candidates like Brown, McMahon and Rehberg are padding their war chests wit=
h campaign cash from corporate polluters, happy to oppose climate policies =
but support tax breaks for Big Oil. Their vision of government is one of de=
regulation, denial, and destruction. It's not a world I want my children an=
d grandchildren to inherit - and I know you agree.

Grassroots support from people like you can tip the balance in these tight =
races. And in these final two weeks, we've got to go all out to beat the Di=
rty Dozen and other anti-environmental candidates.

Chip in what you can, and we'll rush it to key races where it's needed most=
:
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DxbOASJs6JLWGeijPd6UQdw .

This special triple match opportunity couldn't come at a better time, becau=
se grassroots donations are the bedrock of the LCV Victory Fund's success. =
Thank you for being a part of that success with me.

Sincerely,
=A0
Robert Redford
