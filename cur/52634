A CAMPAIGN MONEY WATCH BACKGROUNDER

THE BACKGROUND

This past Sunday, The New York Times reported at length on Sen. John
McCain=B9s close ties to the gambling industry. The story detailed the doze=
ns
of gambling lobbyists on McCain=B9s staff and the vast sums that industry h=
as
given the candidate over the years.

But McCain=B9s ties to the gambling industry are deeper than The New York
Times reported. He has not only raised almost a million dollars from the
sector since 1989 =AD almost all of which has come from major gambling stat=
es
like Nevada and Connecticut =AD but also has allowed gambling executives to
play a prominent role on his staff. Thirty-two federal gambling lobbyists,
and many more state lobbyists, currently serve as staffers or fundraisers o=
n
McCain=B9s campaign.

With gambling issues at the fore in numerous states in recent years, voters
deserve a closer look at the compromised interests of one of the leading
presidential candidates.


THE FACTS

* Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) has raised $951,502 from gambling interests since
1989.(1)=20

* Of that nearly one million dollars, $760,137 has come from gambling
interests located in Nevada.  The next largest state contributors are
Connecticut ($50,175), Arizona ($31,940), and California ($21,350), all
three of which have large Indian gambling sectors.

* Leading Nevada gambling executives, including the Las Vegas Sands=B9 Shel=
don
Adelson and Wynn Resorts=B9 Stephen Wynn, have bundled hundreds of thousand=
s
of dollars for the McCain campaign.

* Thirty-two federal gambling lobbyists currently serve as staffers or
fundraisers for the McCain campaignThe above is only a snapshot of John
McCain=B9s ties to the gambling industry.
