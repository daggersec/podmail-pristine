Dear colleagues,

As many of you know, Georgetown University last fall recognized the remarka=
ble accomplishments of our colleague, Phil Schrag, in bestowing upon him a =
President=92s Award for Distinguished Scholar-Teachers.  By this award, Geo=
rgetown honors faculty members from across the University who have excelled=
 in both scholarship and teaching, and combined them in imaginative ways, o=
ver many years.  When the President=92s Awards were given out at the last F=
all Faculty Convocation, Phil was unable to be present. President DeGioia h=
as generously agreed to come to the Law Center to celebrate Phil=92s accomp=
lishments with our faculty. This will occur at lunch next Wednesday, Januar=
y 14, at noon (the day and time of our regular Dean=92s Luncheon). Please n=
ote that we will hold this lunch on the 12th Floor of Gewirz.

We hope you can come to celebrate a great career in legal education. Please=
 RSVP using this form:  https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_-hbtFhVZAVuR6bx-H=
ocjzT5ecOAPm9MdAMmis0axPI/viewform?usp=3Dsend_form .

Best wishes,
Bill
