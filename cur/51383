i think Hillary=92s campaign slogan should be=20
"Come Back to the Center=94

people are so tired of the political extremes, and while she doesn=92t =
have to refer to her husband, the clinton years were by far the most =
centrist.. and also arguably the most prosperous and peaceful. =93center=94=
 plays well with =93middle class=94 in the center of the socio-economic =
spectrum; America should be front and center on the world stage.. there =
are many ways to slice it, but the overall theme is simple. and the =
fight will not be about turning out the far left (they will show up for =
her) it will be about winning the center.

just a thought.
