Team,
Tomorrow has turned out to be a meeting marathon here at HQ.  For those
joining remotely, please join by Google hangout so you can hear AND see
everything (Marissa is sending info)!
Input on the agenda below is welcome.  Overall, we have three objectives
(1) Lock in a speech concept and location for the official launch (2)
brainstorm a theory of the case on strategic objectives after the launch
(3) some housekeeping on process and structure.

Podesta--we are going to debrief with you after 5:30 on the parts that you
can't participate in.

1. Launch speech brainstorm 12:45-1:45 (with Podesta)

2. Launch location 1:45-2:45

3. Post Launch strategy 2:45-4:45
--What is our strategic objective after the launch (until August)?  How do
we want to approach rapid response vs. proactive communications?
--What's our theory about what HRC should be doing to achieve that
objective?  Promoting four fights?  Appealing to our base?  Policy rollouts?
--Who is our target audience:  Early 4 states?  Our national base
coalition?  The media?  Actual voters?
--Who do we want to pick fights with?  GOP candidates?  Bad guys in society?
--When we respond, who is our audience? (donors/activists, media, actual
voters?)

5. Process moving forward 4:45-5:30
--Standing meetings/check ins
--Material review and sign off process
