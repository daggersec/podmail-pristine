Dear John,=20

103 days. That's all that remains between now and Election Day.=20

That's all the time we have to make sure that Kirsten stays in the Senate f=
ighting for progressive values like marriage equality, equal pay and a woma=
n's right to choose.=20

Your personal and financial support throughout this campaign has meant the =
world to Kirsten. Now we need to make sure she heads into these last 100 da=
ys as strong as possible.=20

I've crunched the numbers and Kirsten is close to our July goal =E2=80=93 j=
ust $42,331 away. But with less than 5 days until the deadline, she needs y=
our help now.=20

Please make a donation now. Help Kirsten raise the $42,331 she needs to mak=
e her goal before Tuesday's deadline. https://secure.democratsenators.org/o=
/44/t/11833/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate2012.sjs?donate_page_KEY=
=3D15398

Republicans have made their agenda pretty clear: gutting Medicare, repealin=
g health care reform, and if Kirsten's opponent has her way, overturning Ro=
e v. Wade.=20

That's why we need to keep the Senate in Democratic hands by making sure Ki=
rsten is prepared for whatever the GOP has planned in these next 100 days. =
Please give now. https://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/11833/p/wfc/dsc=
c/senators/gillibrand/donate2012.sjs?donate_page_KEY=3D15398

Thanks for everything,=20
