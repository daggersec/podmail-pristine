Yes, mainly. They sent over the most ridiculous contract we=E2=80=99ve =
ever seen. The only leverage we have over them is holding out on the =
questionnaire. Also, we didn=E2=80=99t have the manpower to work on the =
questionnaire until recently - Ann O=E2=80=99Leary is working on it and =
will probably have it ready later tonight.

executive director, who you know well, Jess O'Connell, heard from Dennis =

announcement.  However, EMILY's List has never raised money for a =
candidate without that choice questionnaire.  We sent the choice =
questionnaires Secretary Clinton signed in 2007 for the presidential and =
2005 for her senate re-election.  The 2007 questionnaire was negotiated =
by Judy Lichtman and Melanne Verveer.  All we need is that exact =
questionnaire and response signed and dated April 12, 2015 so we can go =
live and raise money on Sunday.  It is not a public questionnaire, it =
will never be public.  The questions aren't even public. =20

the mail as soon as possible.  We can work that out next week, but the =
choice questionnaire we need this weekend.
