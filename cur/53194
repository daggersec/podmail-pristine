John --

As families around the country get together to celebrate fathers today, =
I'm thinking about dads like Alex.

Alex is the father of two boys and two girls, ages six to 13. During the =
week, he works the 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. shift as a front-desk supervisor at a =
Seattle hotel. After work and on the weekends, he devotes his time to a =
summer organizing program that's giving more than 1,500 first-time =
organizers the training they need to help build this movement in their =
communities.

He says he hopes this organizing work will help teach his kids the power =
one person can have -- that if "they see something that needs to be =
changed, they know they can make a difference."

I wanted to share a video of Alex explaining what prompted him to join =
this program and devote his summer to this work.

I was really moved by what he had to say. Take a look, and share it with a =
dad you're thinking about today:

http://my.barackobama.com/Fathers-Day6

Today, I'm also proud of my husband, the man who drove our first daughter =
and me home from the hospital 13 years ago next month, determined to be =
the kind of father he hadn't had for himself.

Barack often says he decided that day that if he could be anything in =
life, he'd be a good dad, and he dedicated himself then and there to =
making sure our daughter had every opportunity he could provide.

When it comes down to it, that's why we're all here -- Barack, Alex, =
myself, and everyone who's part of this campaign. We're all working to =
make sure we leave our kids with a country that's fairer and more full of =
opportunity -- just as our parents did for us.

Thank you for being part of that work, and part of this campaign.

Wishing you a happy Father's Day,

Michelle
