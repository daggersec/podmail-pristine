John --=20

It's a calm, quiet day in Boston today. It's difficult to believe=20
that such horror filled our streets only a week ago.

Two times, bombs rocked the streets of Copley Square. Three
lives were taken that day, and a law enforcement officer
was killed just three days later. More than 260 people were
wounded, many of whom remain hospitalized with amputations
and other scars of tragedy.

I've heard from folks across the country, asking what they
can do to help. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and
Boston Mayor Tom Menino have formed a fund to help the
people most affected by these tragic events.

If you're looking for a way to help, please consider
making a donation to The One Fund Boston today:

http://my.barackobama.com/The-One-Fund

During the Boston Marathon, everyone in our city cheers for
each other. We help each other across the finish line. When
terror struck, we acted as a family. Throughout the chaos,
courageous people ran toward danger to help strangers in
need.

Now we cry together. We pray together. We help each other.

No one can replace what we've lost here in Boston. But
today, and in the weeks and months ahead, we'll get through
it together -- through sorrow and anger, rehabilitation and
recovery. That's what families do.

The OFA family knows how to work together to accomplish
amazing things. Let's make a difference for the Boston
Marathon victims.

Your donation will directly help the families who
need it most.

From West, Texas to Watertown, Massachusetts, we=20
remember and honor the men, women, and children we=20
lost last week. We help those whose lives will never be=20
the same. And we thank our first responders, medical=20
professionals, law enforcement officers, and National=20
Guard for their heroic work.

I'm very proud of the people of Massachusetts for their
strength, resolve, and courage. Bostonians are tough.=20

We are fighters -- and we cannot be broken.

No matter where you live, thank you for being with us in
our time of crisis and our time of healing. We run together.
