None of this is easy.   Again, if it were, it would never get to the
president=E2=80=99s desk.  I=E2=80=99ve spent many hours in the Situation R=
oom puzzling
over hard choices.  I was there among the small group advising the
President about whether or not to go after Bin Laden.  It was a tough
call.  His advisors were split.  I thought, after reviewing the
intelligence, after being briefed about the  potential operations, it was a
risk but a risk worth taking.  But I have to tell you, your stomach is in
your throat the whole time.  And the President had to leave the Situation
Room and go make the final decision.

There=E2=80=99s a lot of talk in this campaign between Senator Sanders and =
myself
about whether voters will vote with their head or their heart.  Let me ask
you to vote with both.  (Applause.)  Let me ask you to think about those
values, those feelings, those hopes that really do come from our hearts.

Think about the size of the hearts of the two people behind me.  Nobody
would have thought twice if they just retired to their home in Tucson and
just enjoyed the love and life they share together with their wonderful
dog.  But it took heart.  It took heart for them to decide that wasn=E2=80=
=99t
enough.

You have to be led by your heart if you are in public life to try to help
other people.  That=E2=80=99s what led me to go to work for the Children=E2=
=80=99s Defense
Fund.  It led me to go door to door, not far from here in New Bedford,
Massachusetts, trying to find kids with disabilities, so we could make the
case that they belonged at school.  Led me to go by myself to Alabama
undercover to try to find out what was happening as white communities shut
the public schools to open up segregated academies, and how we could stop
that.

It led me to go to South Carolina to try to get juveniles out of adult
jails where they did not belong.  It led me to be a legal services lawyer,
chair of the Legal Services Corporation, because it=E2=80=99s fundamental t=
o my
belief in justice and equality, that everyone should have access to a
lawyer to defend themselves, to represent themselves.
