Hi John, I completely understand why dinner at your home did not include so=
meone like me, who's a known quantity to Clinton campaign veterans. But I w=
anted to make an appeal for an early opportunity to get myself and the Dail=
y Beast Political editor, Jackie Kucinich, on your radar so I/we can write =
and report knowledgeably. There's a long campaign ahead, and I'd like to es=
tablish a line of communications. Is there an assistant I should go through=
? I look forward to working with you (and maybe getting some of that pasta =
and walnut sauce dish!!) All best, Eleanor
