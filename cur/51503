ISRAEL: The killing of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin in Gaza - a government of
crooks!

A government that engages in fraud on bereaved families of its own people
for cynical purposes from the beginning to the end of the current cycle of
violence in Gaza...

Pictures:

1) August 2, 2014, around 9:00pm: The Goldin family in a press conference
on Saturday night, where they called upon the Israeli government not to
retreat from Gaza, while leaving their son a captive. (captured from a
Channel2 TV, published by Haaretz)
2) August 3, 2014: The front page of Israel Hayom (Sheldon Adelson's
propaganda tool for Prime Minister Netanyahu) on Sunday morning, with
headlines: "Goldin is dead", "Retreating from Gaza and redeploying".

___
OccupyTLV, August 3 - so let's put things in order:

On Saturday night (last night), after being briefed by senior government
officials regarding Friday's events, the Goldin family called a press
conference, 'where they called not to retreat from Gaza, while deserting
their son.. the father, Dr Simha Goldin said: "... I can't imagine IDF
deserting a warrior... It just can't be..." ' [1]
But after midnight last night, reality took a diametrical transformatin,
as "Yisrael Hayom" reported on its front page this morning, Sunday:
"Goldin is dead". The explanation - "Minister of Defense Yaalon, Chief of
IDF Personnel Barbivai, IDF Chief Rabbi Rafi Peretz arrived last night
after midnight to Goldin's home to deliver the difficult message". [2]
So what happened late last night that the Israeli government decided that
Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was no longer a captive, but dead?
The answer to that question can be found on the front page of this
morning's Yisrael Hayom as well - "Retreating from Gaza and redeploying".
[2]

Simply put:The opening an closing acts, a few weeks apart, of the current
cycle of violence are remarkably similar. The current cycle started with
the kidnapping and murder of three Jewish youths in Palestine near Hebron,
and it ended with the kidnapping and killing of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin in
Palestine, Gaza.

In both cases, the Israeli government tried, and partially succeeded, to
perpetrate despicable fraud on the bereaved families of the kidnapped, on
the people of the State of Israel, and on the world public at large:

In the case of the three kindapped and murdered youths in Hebron, the
Israeli government initially hid the existence of a phone recording from
one of the victims, which would have led any reasonable person to conclude
that the youths were most likely dead. Eventually, the existence of the
recording was leaked. Then the government claimed that the recording was
unintelligble. But eventually, it was distributed on social networks, loud
and clear. The fraud was exploited to win time for a false search and
rescue operation, which in fact was a campaign of collective punishment
and terror against the Palestinian population in the Hebron area in
general, and against Hamas legitimate political and welfare infrastructure
in particular. (Hamas was declared the perpetrator, although no evidence
was ever provided to that effect). The kidnapping/murder near Hebron and
its aftermath were the original cause of the current cycle of violence.
In the case of the killing of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin in Gaza, there is no
doubt that already on Friday, the date of the incident, the Israeli
government had all the facts in the matter. And the facts would lead any
reasonable person to conclude that he was dead by Friday. Regardless,
senior government officers planted false impressions with the Goldin
family, that the their son was a captive of Hamas. The motive was again
most likely the wish to exploit the situation for a major retalitory
campaign. However, once the Israeli government decided on Saturday to
unilaterally retreat from Gaza, all of a sudden, the purported captivity
of Lieutenant Hadar Goldin became a burden, or even a trap. Then the IDF
Chief Rabbi was recruited, and Goldin was declared dead...
One should notice that in this discussion, the issue of how Lieutenant
Hadar Goldin was killed, is avoided. That issue requires an entirely
separate discussion...

A government that engages in such despicable conduct vis a vis bereaved
families of its own people, is a government of crooks!

The current cycle of violence is an unprecedented fraud by the Israeli
government on the people of the State of Israel and the world's public at
large from any aspect that it is examined. [3] But no government would
engage in such conduct against its own people, unless it believed that it
could pull it off...

Israeli Intelligence Officers Doubt Hamas Involvement In Incident That
Sparked Gaza War
http://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/israeli-intelligence-officers-doubt-hamas-involvement-in-inc

UPDATE: August 5, 2014
The Israeli daily Haaretz editorial today, linked below, is still
circumspect. It does note that Israel exploited the claim that Goldin was
a captive to continue the violence. However, enough details were released,
to make a reasonable person conclude that IDF knew that Lieutenant Hadar
Goldin was dead already on Friday, in the the immediate aftermath of the
incident.
