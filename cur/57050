John --

It's no secret that this Sunday's midyear fundraising deadline is a big =
deal for Democrats in targeted districts.

Once the books close, the media, the pundits and our opponents will use =
their fundraising totals as a measure of strength and chances to win.

My friend Cheri Bustos in Illinois could really use your help. She's in a =
highly competitive district that'll likely be targeted by outside groups =
and their negative attack ads. As chairman of the committee charged with =
electing House Democrats, I can tell you this is going to be a close race.

Please help Cheri Bustos have the strongest showing possible on Sunday by =
giving a gift online of $10 or more right now. Every dollar counts for =
their grassroots campaign.

Sunday is the biggest FEC deadline yet. So please dig deep for Cheri.

Thanks,
