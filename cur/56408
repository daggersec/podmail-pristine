Friend,

It's happening right at this minute. The Koch Brothers
are hosting a fundraiser for Ken Cuccinelli in New York,
and they threw the doors open at 5:30.

They couldn't have jumped into this race at a better time
for Cuccinelli. The checks he's collecting right now will hit=20
his campaign account just in time for tonight's midnight
fundraising deadline.

While Cuccinelli has the Kochs, Terry's relying on people
like you. And we're almost at our goal -- just $14,550 away
from $100,000 -- but we can't get there without your help.

Click here to rush $5 or whatever you can right now to
support Terry before midnight:
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/may-deadline?refcode=3D20130529=
_eom6

I'm in charge of research for the campaign, not fundraising.=20
So I don't usually send emails like this one.

But the Koch Brothers record speaks for itself and I know
that their priorities are flat wrong for Virginia.

They've bankrolled candidates like Scott Walker in
Wisconsin, Scott Brown in Massachusetts and Mitt Romney.
In every case, they're trying to prop up a candidate
who'll cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires like
them, while leaving the rest of us to fend for ourselves.

If there was ever any doubt about who's standing with Ken
Cuccinelli -- and who he'll stand for as Governor -- this
fundraiser clears it up.

Please stand up to the Koch Brothers by donating $5 before
midnight tonight:
https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/may-deadline?refcode=3D20130529=

Thanks for your support,
