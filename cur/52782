At the request of President-elect Obama, and to avoid even the
appearance of a conflict of interest between the work of President
Clinton and the service of Hillary Clinton should she be nominated and
confirmed as Secretary of State, President Clinton is taking the
following steps above and beyond the requirements of current laws and
regulations.

o     The Clinton Foundation will publish the names of everyone who has
contributed since its founding in 1997 (this year).

o     Should Senator Clinton be nominated and confirmed as Secretary of
State, during her time of service, the Foundation will also publish the
names of everyone who contributes going forward on an annual basis.

o     The Foundation will separately incorporate CGI from the
Foundation; President Clinton will continue to host CGI gatherings, such
as the one in NYC and its meetings for college and university students,
as Founding Chairman of CGI.=20

o     Although President Clinton will continue to invite participants to
CGI events (which involves normal registration fees), he will not
solicit "sponsorship" contributions for CGI.

o     CGI will also not host annual events outside the US and CGI will
not solicit or accept foreign contributions.

o     Given the extensive and life-saving work of the Clinton
Foundation's HIV/AIDS Initiative which can and should continue, the
Foundation will continue to fulfill its commitments funded by foreign
governments (including, among others, Sweden Norway, France, Great
Britain).  In the event an existing contributing country chooses to
substantially increase its commitment, or a new country, or
government-owned entity, decides to contribute, the Foundation will
share such proposed contributions with the State Department ethics
officials.  State may also share the issue to the WH Counsel's office
for review.  To whatever extent there are conflict of interest concerns
raised about such potential contributions related to Senator Clinton's
service as Secretary, they will be conveyed to Hillary Clinton and the
Clinton Foundation for appropriate action.

o     Same procedure to be followed for any foreign country contributors
to CCI, CGSCI and CHDI. =20


o     Regarding President Clinton's private work, during her tenure,
President Clinton will share proposed hosts of speeches with the State
Department ethics officials for their review, and as appropriate for
review by the White House Counsel.  Again, should there be conflict of
interest concerns related to the Senator's anticipated service as
Secretary, they while share those concerns with Senator and President
Clinton for appropriate action. =20


o     During her tenure as Secretary of State, should she be nominated
and confirmed, President Clinton will share any proposed consultant
relationships with State Department ethics officials, and the same
procedures outlined above will apply here as well.

o     None of these protocols is required by any law, and all of them go
above and beyond the requirements of the law to avoid even the
appearance of a conflict of interest.

o     The procedures are, of course, in addition, to the already
extensive laws and regulations government the activities of spouses of
federal officials (such as those outlined in 5 USC 208 and related
regulations).
