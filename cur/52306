The weekly Georgetown University Bereavement Group is a year-round service =
(Summer, Fall, and Spring) for all University employees (staff, faculty, AA=
P's, temps) and graduate and undergraduate students. We meet at 1:00 PM on =
Thursdays. This group is simply a "circle of care" open to those in our Uni=
versity community who are experiencing grief from the recent or not so rece=
nt loss of a family member, close friend, or associate. We meet at the Jewi=
sh Center's Makom Gathering Space located in the Leavey Center on the left =
of the hallway that leads toward Cosi and Starbucks. You may bring a bevera=
ge and lunch (no meat, please), if you wish.

Sponsored by Campus Ministry since the mid-80's, many participants from all=
 parts of the campus and beyond have found comfort and support and at times=
 lifted spirits in the short time spent weekly with the group. Summer is tr=
ansitional - some of us too busy, some not busy enough, and vacation memori=
es, trips not taken, and other thoughts can "wash" over the participants of=
 all ages. Sharing feelings in the comfort of others proves helpful. For mo=
re information and to let us know your plans to attend, please contact:  An=
