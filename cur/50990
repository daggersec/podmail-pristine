We just ended our Ignite! Conference in St. Louis, where 1,000 of our best
member leaders gathered to recommit to fighting to build economic and
political power for all workers!



I=E2=80=99m following up on our conversation on how Secretary Clinton can e=
ngage
with SEIU members and non-union workers.  As you know our members are
putting their hearts and souls into the Fight for $15 and a union,
commonsense immigration reform, delivering on the promise of ACA, Blacks
Lives Matter, and voting rights for everyone.



I=E2=80=99m looking forward to working together to think about how we can c=
reate
spaces for the Secretary to have a dialogue with our members and non-union
workers, so she can hear their stories, and they can hear how she=E2=80=99s
thinking about the issues that matter to working people. Here are a few
ideas:



*1.     **April 15 -- Fight for $15 Day of Action: *The movement that
started with fast food workers in NYC has exploded to include Walmart
workers, airport baggage handlers and passenger service attendants, home
care providers, child care workers, adjunct college faculty, and other
underpaid people who want to create jobs that pay people enough to actually
live on. On April 15, workers will take action in a major mobilization in
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City and two hundred other cities across the
globe.  These workers are taking a huge risk by taking a stand and need
public support in the media and at actions.

*2.     **Workers=E2=80=99 Roundtables: *These would provide an opportunity=
 to have
a conversation with workers about the challenges they face and to test
drive solutions together. For example, we could pull together a group of
childcare providers and fast food workers to talk with the Secretary about
the challenges of our nation=E2=80=99s lack of affordable, accessible, and
universal childcare for low-wage workers and providers.

*3.     **=E2=80=9CWalk a Day=E2=80=9D with our members*.  Sec. Clinton spe=
nding a day with
childcare, homecare or other workers would be incredibly compelling and
lift up the courageous, important and difficult work that service sector
workers do every day to take care of our children, elderly and the disabled=
.


*4.     **Conversations with SEIU Leadership: *The SEIU Executive Committee
(approx. 30 local union leaders) will meet in May in Chicago, and our full
International Executive Board (70 local union leaders) will meet in Detroit
in June.  We could also pull together any subsection of leaders based on
geography, industry, or other criteria.



Here=E2=80=99s a list of some of what=E2=80=99s on our calendar already. We=
=E2=80=99re surprisingly
nimble and could add public or private events with relatively fast
turnaround.



March 30 =E2=80=93 April 3             National Week of Action for Commonse=
nse
Immigration Reform

Immigration Reform

May TBD                            SEIU Executive Committee Meeting, Chicag=
o

May/June TBD                   SCOTUS decision on King v. Burwell

June 8-12                          SEIU International Executive Board
Meeting, Detroit



I look forward to talking more.  Will be in Eastern time zone the rest of
the week.
