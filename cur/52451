  *No One Is Trying to Make You Eat
Asparagus*<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-chiong/no-one-is-trying-to-make-_b_768951.html>
*By: James Chiong *
*Executive Director of Health Information Campaign*

Judge Hudson quipped in Monday's proceedings of *Cuccinelli v.
Sebelius*that the minimum coverage provision was akin to the federal
government
forcing an individual to eat asparagus. This is the heart of several legal
challenges to the new health care law. Last week a US District judge
dismissed a similar suit against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in Michigan.

I'm not a lawyer, so I am not qualified to speak on the merits of either
side's legal arguments. But yesterday, I decided to go to Richmond, Va. to
hear the arguments in person. Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli is trying to
make the case that Congress exceeded its authority by trying to regulate
inactivity because under the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause, the
federal government only has the power to regulate activity, not inactivity.
The federal government's attorney countered that, since no one can just "opt
out" of getting sick or injured, choosing not to have insurance constitutes
activity. Therefore, Congress was within its constitutional authority to
require that everyone have health insurance beginning in 2014.

This is where Judge Hudson's asparagus quip is problematic -- and where
Cuccinelli's argument is way off-base. While it might make sense for some to
make that comparison that health insurance is just another good or service,
this is too narrow a lens to view this situation.

Consumption of health services is almost exclusively funneled into insurance
companies, making them the middleman most Americans must go through to
access what may be very costly but essential services. Health insurance is
simply the means by which most Americans access the health services market.
The lens to look at this market is not the insurance market, but the overall
health services market.

The US health care system is not the same as the market for asparagus. It is
one-sixth of our economy, and from our first breaths to our last, everyone
is a part of it. From antibiotics and vaccinations to heart attacks and
cancer, interactions with the health care system are unavoidable. While one
can choose whether or not to buy insurance, one cannot choose to be sick and
almost no one refuses medical treatment entirely. Virtually everyone
participates. If I choose not to eat my asparagus, that's my business and it
does not impact others. If I choose not to buy health insurance, get sick,
and rack up six figures in medical bills I can't afford to pay, my costs are
passed on to everyone else.

A study found that every family health insurance premium contains a hidden
tax of $1,100. Hospitals pay billions in charity care and unpaid bills, all
of which come back to the paying customers in the form of higher charges.
The higher costs get, the harder it is for people to pay and the
cost-shifting cycle continues. It's that cycle: high costs = less coverage =
higher costs -- that led Congress to pass the ACA in the first place.

Cuccinelli's perspective is far different from mine. Countless Virginia
families, the millions of Americans who applauded passage of this law are
looking for a fair health care system that brings costs under control.
Eliminating free riders who add costs and unnecessary risks to the system is
part of that.

Outside the courthouse Families USA and Virginia Organizing held press
conferences featuring Virginians who have already benefited from the law's
Patient Bill of Right's provisions that already outlaw canceling coverage
just because someone gets sick, prohibit denial coverage due to pre-existing
conditions, extend coverage to students and young adults, and require
coverage of preventive services that keep us healthy.

These are all things that Cuccinelli's lawsuit threatens. In fact,
Cuccinelli doesn't just want one provision ruled unconstitutional -- he
wants Judge Hudson to throw out the whole law and halt implementation
efforts occurring in every state until the Supreme Court eventually hears
the case.

Cuccinelli's extremist legal views threaten the new insurance protections
and coverage of million of Americans, not just Virginians. I hope Judge
Hudson is thinking bigger than asparagus.
