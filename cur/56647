<p class=3D"MsoNormal">First, I hope the most recent binder was helpful.=C2=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Second, I also understand that you wanted to learn m=

 quick snapshot of the state of play.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve also attached the memo=
 that was in the most recent binder.=C2=A0 Feel free
 to call if you want to discuss this in more detail, or we can set up a con=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><u>The big picture:=C2=A0</u></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">We are laying the groundwork for a website that can =
go up if and when you decide to announce an exploratory committee.=C2=A0 Th=
e purpose of this site is to allow visitors to donate, sign up, and invite =
other people to the site via social media
 (this would be the &quot;new&quot; feature).=C2=A0 All the features of thi=

and very different looking--website will go up if/when you officially launc=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><u>Eric Schmidt&#39;s company &quot;Groundwork&qu=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Eric has a small staff of about ten people in Brookl=
yn working on two key tools for the web page, which are listed below. Both =
tools would be great to have in the exploratory site and would help the sit=

 we are prepared to move forward without them and have tested backup altern=
atives from the Obama campaign that are ready to use at any time.=C2=A0</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">I deliberately told Eric&#39;s team that we would ne=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">Contrary to what Eric sometimes implies in his conve=

dy Goff, President Obama&#39;s Digital Director.=C2=A0 We are operating und=
er the precautionary assumption that legally we
 cannot begin designing the visual part of the site until 4-5 weeks before =
you decide to announce an exploratory committee, since they are candidate s=
pecific and would require contracting with designers (there&#39;s also a ri=
sk of leaks).=C2=A0 So, the back end architecture
 is being built (and can be used by any candidate should you not run), but =
what you can see on a screen and interact with will not be developed until =

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">The features for the site will be a mix of off-the-s=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><b><u>Leadership</u></b></p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>
<p class=3D"MsoNormal">One of the reasons I think the CTO should be slated =
early in the hiring schedule is that she or he should act as a guide on the=
 technology strategy as a whole, working with you and the campaign leadersh=
ip from the start to develop a true
 vision for the role tech will play and actual projects the campaign should=
 invest in.=C2=A0 It&#39;s important that the campaign not simply hire engi=
neers and invest in technology for its own sake, but rather work with techn=
ological experts to identify specific ways
 that technology can make the campaign more efficient and then develop a pl=
an and timeline to build solutions.=C2=A0 For example, we know right now th=
at developing the tools that will make volunteer offices =E2=80=9Cpaperless=
=E2=80=9D will save thousands of hours of data entry
 and administrative work.<span>=C2=A0 </span>We also know that developing n=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal">=C2=A0</p>

 as possible for all of us, from who we consult for prospects to perhaps as=
