John,

New Mexico Senate candidate Martin Heinrich has earned a perfect 100% lifet=
ime score on LCV's National Environmental Scorecard while representing New =
Mexico's 1st congressional district.

Martin has been an invaluable leader in championing clean energy jobs and o=
ur natural treasures.

Will you help us raise $45,000 by June 30th to help Martin win?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DqvCzrUCFET6kfWK6TKc8cQ..

When New Mexico Rep. Martin Heinrich announced this spring that he was runn=
ing to replace Sen. Jeff Bingaman, we moved quickly to endorse him. And fra=
nkly, we're glad we did.

As soon as Martin announced for U.S. Senate, the attacks from Big Oil's cro=
nies in Washington came fast and furious. In fact, just a few weeks ago, na=
tional Republicans slammed Martin for supporting the elimination of billion=
s in tax breaks and other giveaways that the top five oil companies receive=
 each year.

These are the same oil companies that raked in more than $36 billion in pro=
fits in the first quarter of 2011 alone.

To help Martin answer these vicious attacks, LCV Action Fund's goal is to r=
aise $45,000 before the June 30th second quarter FEC fundraising deadline. =
Will you join us right now with a contribution of=A0$500.00 to Martin Heinr=
ich for Senate?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D5VmlRxWKzTtPAup5yzKXgQ..

Since LCV's endorsement, we've raised more than $21,970 in direct contribut=
ions for his campaign, but we still need to reach our goal of $45,000 by Ju=
ne 30th. LCV Action Fund raised the $21,970 for Martin by bundling contribu=
tions from hundreds of environmental voters through LCV Action Fund's bundl=
ing program - GiveGreen.

During his time in the U.S. House of Representatives representing New Mexic=
o's 1st district, Martin has earned a perfect 100% lifetime scoreon LCV's N=
ational Environmental Scorecard. By contrast, former Rep. Heather Wilson, o=
ne of Martin's declared opponents, has an abysmal lifetime score of just 15=
%.

Martin is such a true champion on environmental issues that LCV chose to ma=
ke him the earliest endorsement in a cycle in LCV's history. He is a proud =
member of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition and he has stead=
fastly defended the EPA's ability to protect public health and hold pollute=
rs accountable under the Clean Air Act. He has also worked to protect New M=
exico's abundant natural resources and public lands as an active member on =
the House Committee
on Natural Resources.

Martin needs our help. Will you help LCV Action Fund raise $45,000 by June =
30th by making a donation of=A0$500.00 right now?
http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DqMipqXoVa8Q4Cx55tNTLQw..

Bundling contributions from environmental donors like you to environmental =
champions like Martin is more important than ever before. We expect million=
s will be spent by anti-environmental extremists in New Mexico this year.=
=A0In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United vs. FEC, corp=
orate special interests spent tens of millions of dollars in the midterm el=
ections in 2010, and they are poised to spend millions more this year and n=
ext.=A0New Mexico, while small in population, will be a critical swing stat=
e. It doesn't cost much to blanket the airwaves in New Mexico with negative=
 attacks by Big Oil and Dirty Coal.

If environmental donors join together and support true environmental leader=
s like Martin, we'll win in 2012. I hope you'll make a donation to Martin H=
einrich for Senate right now: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DTJy_O3pk2hcQ=

Thanks so much for your support.
