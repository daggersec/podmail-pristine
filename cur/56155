Dear Mary, 

It has been a whirlwind year. And I want you to know that all of us here at Clean Water are profoundly grateful for your support. 

Like most non-profits, Clean Water Fund has had to make some tough choices over the last few years. I am proud of our ability to maintain strong and effective programs and continue to deliver results on the Clean Water issues that matter the most. 

Thanks to your support, Mary, we have continued to lead the fight to strengthen the Clean Water Act, the push to ban the plastic additive Bisphenol A (BPA), and efforts to advance a clean energy future that will move the country away from the dirty technologies of the past, create new jobs, and protect our water. 

But we need your support [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=8119 ] to build on the momentum we have created in 2010 and seize the opportunities before us. Your year-end contribution is especially important since it will support Clean Water Fund's most urgent programs and campaigns for clean and safe water. 

Mary, can I rely on you to make a year end contribution to Clean Water Fund today? [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=8119 ] Your gift of $50, $100 - or even more - will be put to use immediately to help advance Clean Water's vision for water protection in the 21st century. 

Clean Water Fund's strategy for protecting our water is successful because, with your help, we have been able to continue pressing forward with an ambitious water protection agenda at the federal level, state and local levels in more than twenty states. 

I hope we can once again count on your generosity. 

Again, thank you for support. 

Now and for the Future, 

Robert Wendelgass

CEO 

P.S. - Get your gift matched dollar for dollar until December 31st! Please don't delay in making your most generous gift [ https://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=8119 ] - to be matched by a generous anonymous donor today and help us continue to build momentum for water protections as we head into 2011.
