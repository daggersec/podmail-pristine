Michael Vachon had me come up to New York today to sit with George
Soros and show him our ads. He liked them...a lot. And he REALLY liked
McSame. I thought I'd be skewered for name puns but he thought it was
sticky.

Since he is a right-wing punching bag he just wanted to make sure he
was OK with anything he was accused of funding.
