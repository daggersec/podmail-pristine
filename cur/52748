Dear John --

My name is Anuj Gupta, and I'm the Border State Director for Barack =
Obama's Campaign for Change in Virginia.

The next phase of our Campaign is up and running in Virginia, and =
supporters like you are busy building the movement that will carry Barack =
Obama to victory in November.

But we need your help.

Supporters right across the border in Virginia delivered a crucial primary =
victory for Barack Obama this winter that helped secure the Democratic =
presidential nomination.  But now the general election is fast =
approaching, and Virginia is an important battleground state.

That's why we're asking you to be part of the Virginia Sister City program =
and join fellow supporters from your area in adopting a community right =
across the border in Virginia.

Get started this Saturday, July 26th, by taking a trip to Virginia to help =
build Barack Obama's Campaign for Change.

Sign up to volunteer this weekend and make a difference in a crucial =
battleground state:

http://my.barackobama.com/VAsistercity

The general election is coming up sooner than you may think. After this =
Saturday, July 26th, there will be just 100 days until November 4th.

Time flies when you're building the largest grassroots campaign in the =
history of presidential politics.  That's why it's so important to get =
involved today.

Supporters like you who adopt a sister city in Virginia will return there =
over the next 100 days to get to know local residents, help bring people =
into the political process, and get the word out about our Campaign for =
Change.

Here's how the Virginia Sister City program works:

Campaign for Change staff will help match you with other folks from your =
area.  Then we'll help you all find one area in Virginia to reach out to =
this Saturday -- and to keep returning to as the election approaches.

By adopting a sister city in Virginia, it will be easy to coordinate rides =
from your community.  And by returning there over the next 100 days, =
you'll be able to build a lasting connection and see your impact grow.

No previous experience is required. Our staff will give you everything you =
need to succeed. All you have to bring is a hunger for change and a =
willingness to turn your enthusiasm into action.

Sign up now to adopt a sister city in Virginia, and Campaign for Change =
staff will be in touch soon:

http://my.barackobama.com/VAsistercity=20

We can't do this without you.

Thanks,

Anuj

Anuj Gupta
Border State Director
Virginia Campaign for Change

P.S. -- If you can't make it this weekend, there will be plenty of =
opportunities to get involved as the campaign season heats up.  Sign up =
now to help out in the weeks and months ahead:
