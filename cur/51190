I know and this is in my court right now. My team stayed late last night and
we're staying late tonight. The pieces we're putting together include: ad
reel, 25 reasons McCain is bad, "plan powerpoint" and a 2-pager on the plan.


is that sufficient?

<p>I have spent the morning circling back will all of our major

While people are willing to help, to the person, they need a plan for -- &nbsp;how,

I know I am sounding like a pest, but these people have now been waiting for
