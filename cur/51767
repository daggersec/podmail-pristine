U.S. Ethanol Expansion Cost Mexico Billions in Higher Import Prices
GDAE study estimates that ethanol added $1.5-$3.2 billion from 2006-11

How much have U.S. ethanol policies pushed up corn prices? And how much has=
 these higher prices cost developing countries dependent on imports for the=
ir staple foods? According to a new Working Paper by Timothy A. Wise, Resea=
rch and Policy Director at Tufts University's Global Development and Enviro=
nment Institute (GDAE), it cost Mexico between $1.5 and $3.2 billion from 2=
006 and 2011, when U.S. corn ethanol production expanded dramatically and f=
ood prices rose to alarming levels.

The Working Paper, "The Cost to Mexico of U.S. Corn Ethanol Expansion<http:=
//www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/wp/12-01WiseBiofuels.pdf>," was released toda=
y in Mexico City on the eve of a key meeting of vice ministers of agricultu=
re from the G-20 countries. They meet to set the G-20 agenda on food securi=
ty in advance of the G-20 summit June 18-19 in Los Cabos, Mexico.

"Mexico is the chair of the G-20," notes Wise. "The government has the oppo=
rtunity to take a strong lead in that powerful body to address the underlyi=
ng causes of the food crisis. Curbing the expansion of biofuels is crucial =
to that effort. Mexico bans the use of corn for ethanol to protect food sec=
urity. Our study shows that Mexicans themselves have suffered from less res=
trictive U.S. biofuels policies."

The Working Paper, which is being released in Mexico in conjunction with a =
policy report<http://actionaidusa.org/news/pr/us_ethanol_policy_costs_mexic=
o_250-500_million_each_year/> from the international aid organization, Acti=
onAid, finds that:

 *   Ethanol now consumes 40% of U.S. corn production. The production of co=
rn for U.S. ethanol has grown dramatically in the last decade, spurred by U=
.S. government policies and rising oil prices.
 *   U.S. ethanol expansion has raised corn prices. Conservative estimates =
suggest that prices would have been 21% lower in 2010 without the rising de=
mand from U.S. ethanol. Other estimates<http://necsi.edu/research/social/fo=
odprices/mexico/> suggest that the price impact is as high as 27% for the e=
ntire 2006-11 period.
 *   Mexico imports one-third of its corn, and the added cost due to U.S. e=
thanol was between $1.5 and $3.2 billion from 2006-11. That is between $250=
 and $500 million per year, ten-to-twenty times the amount the Mexican gove=
rnment spends on MasAgro, a productivity program for Mexico's small-scale c=
orn farmers.
 *   This has contributed to rising hunger and food insecurity in Mexico. C=
orn tortillas are the staple of the Mexican diet, accounting for 40% of cal=
ories consumed in the country. Tortilla prices rose 60% over these six year=
s while the cost of the basic food basket jumped 53%. Meat and dairy prices=
, pushed up by high feed costs, increased 35%. In 2011, 56% of Mexicans suf=
fered some period of food insecurity, and five million children went hungry=
.
 *   The implications are even more dire for other food import dependent co=
untries. Countries that grow little of their own staple foods see no benefi=
t from higher prices for any citizens, as they have few farmers gaining fro=
m the price increases. For these countries, biofuel-related price increases=
 are simply a growing drain on limited resources and a significant threat t=
o the food security of their citizens.
The study recommends that the Mexican government take a strong stand in the=
 upcoming G-20 meetings, by demanding that biofuels, commodity speculation,=
 import dependence, and other underlying causes of the food crisis be on th=
e agenda. Wise found in a recent co-authored report, "Resolving the Food Cr=
isis<http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/policy_research/resolving_food_crisis.ht=
ml>," that the G-20 was undermining global efforts to address the crisis, i=
gnoring even its own commissioned studies on food security.

As Wise concludes in the new paper, "Such policies are costing Mexico dearl=
y. Mexico should use its position as chair to put biofuels back on the tabl=
e."

d, 16 May 2012 09:08:02 To: Subject: US ethanol expansion cost Mexico billi=
ons for imports *U.S. Ethanol Expansion Cost Mexico Billions in Higher Impo=
rt Prices** * ** *GDAE study estimates that ethanol added $1.5-$3.2 billion=
 from 2006-11* How much have U.S. ethanol policies pushed up corn prices? A=
nd how much has these higher prices cost developing countries dependent on =
imports for their staple foods? According to a new Working Paper by Timothy=
 A. Wise, Research and Policy Director at Tufts University's Global Develop=
ment and Environment Institute (GDAE), it cost Mexico between $1.5 and $3.2=
 billion from 2006 and 2011, when U.S. corn ethanol production expanded dra=
matically and food prices rose to alarming levels. The Working Paper, &quot=
;The Cost to Mexico of U.S. Corn Ethanol Expansion ,&quot; was released tod=
ay in Mexico City on the eve of a key meeting of vice ministers of agricult=
ure from the G-20 countries. They meet to set the G-20 agenda on food secur=
ity in advance of the G-20 summit June 18-19 in Los Cabos, Mexico. &quot;Me=
xico is the chair of the G-20,&quot; notes Wise. &quot;The government has t=
he opportunity to take a strong lead in that powerful body to address the u=
nderlying causes of the food crisis. Curbing the expansion of biofuels is c=
rucial to that effort. Mexico bans the use of corn for ethanol to protect f=
ood security. Our study shows that Mexicans themselves have suffered from l=
ess restrictive U.S. biofuels policies.&quot; The Working Paper, which is b=
eing released in Mexico in conjunction with a policy report from the intern=
ational aid organization, ActionAid, finds that: * Ethanol now consumes 40%=
 of U.S. corn production. The production of corn for U.S. ethanol has grown=
 dramatically in the last decade, spurred by U.S. government policies and r=
ising oil prices. * U.S. ethanol expansion has raised corn prices. Conserva=
tive estimates suggest that prices would have been 21% lower in 2010 withou=
t the rising demand from U.S. ethanol. Other estimates suggest that the pri=
ce impact is as high as 27% for the entire 2006-11 period. * Mexico imports=
 one-third of its corn, and the added cost due to U.S. ethanol was between =
$1.5 and $3.2 billion from 2006-11. That is between $250 and $500 million p=
er year, ten-to-twenty times the amount the Mexican government spends on Ma=
sAgro, a productivity program for Mexico's small-scale corn farmers. * This=
 has contributed to rising hunger and food insecurity in Mexico. Corn torti=
llas are the staple of the Mexican diet, accounting for 40% of calories con=
sumed in the country. Tortilla prices rose 60% over these six years while t=
he cost of the basic food basket jumped 53%. Meat and dairy prices, pushed =
up by high feed costs, increased 35%. In 2011, 56% of Mexicans suffered som=
e period of food insecurity, and five million children went hungry. * The i=
mplications are even more dire for other food import dependent countries. C=
ountries that grow little of their own staple foods see no benefit from hig=
her prices for any citizens, as they have few farmers gaining from the pric=
e increases. For these countries, biofuel-related price increases are simpl=
y a growing drain on limited resources and a significant threat to the food=
 security of their citizens. The study recommends that the Mexican governme=
nt take a strong stand in the upcoming G-20 meetings, by demanding that bio=
fuels, commodity speculation, import dependence, and other underlying cause=
s of the food crisis be on the agenda. Wise found in a recent co-authored r=
eport, &quot;Resolving the Food Crisis ,&quot; that the G-20 was underminin=
g global efforts to address the crisis, ignoring even its own commissioned =
studies on food security. As Wise concludes in the new paper, &quot;Such po=
licies are costing Mexico dearly. Mexico should use its position as chair t=
o put biofuels back on the table.&quot; Read the GDAE Working Paper, &quot;=
