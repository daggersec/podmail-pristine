Hi John,



I joined a phone bank last night calling Virginia voters =E2=80=93 nearly a=
ll of my
electronic call sheets were for people over 60, with many in their late 80s
and 90s. It caused me to have another sleepless night, anxious about the
campaign.



I=E2=80=99m wondering if there=E2=80=99s something more I can do to help?



I=E2=80=99d be thrilled to join your cast of surrogates, and I have the kin=
d of job
that gives me great flexibility (indeed, it was upon your wise counsel that
I put myself on ice at a university for a while).



I=E2=80=99m particularly good with young people. When I was Deputy, I organ=
ized a
=E2=80=98college tour=E2=80=99 and visited nearly 50 campuses for keynote t=
ype speeches
over my four years.  It wasn=E2=80=99t anything that I was asked to do =E2=
=80=93 I believed
it was critical to maintain youthful energy for the 2012 election and this
was my way of contributing.



My public narrative is that I=E2=80=99m anti-establishment, whether it=E2=
=80=99s from
writing the organic law, leading the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food
effort at USDA, or from many other efforts.  My guess is that I=E2=80=99m a=
n
appealing character for the kind of people energized by Bernie, but who
could be steered, with the right approach, to the =E2=80=9Cprogressive who =
gets
things done.=E2=80=99



College campuses, environmental groups, foodies, women, anything to do with
sustainability =E2=80=93 I=E2=80=99m sure I could walk into a room and be a=
n effective
speaker for our common cause.  Colorado, Texas, Virginia, Maine =E2=80=93 a=
ll
places where I=E2=80=99ve done considerable speaking.  I=E2=80=99m schedule=
d to be in CA
twice in the next month, NY once, NJ too =E2=80=93 at Rutgers.  And of cour=
se, I
hail from Massachusetts.



Well, I feel better just by making the offer.  My now 17 year old daughter
Fiona and I were up in snowy Manchester NH in 2008 working for Hillary and
she was with me at the phone bank last night.  We are passionate about this
race and will do whatever it takes.



I hope you are doing okay, whether this note finds you in snowy DC today or
up in Brooklyn.  I am deeply grateful for your leadership and if anything
gives me confidence that all will be okay in this election, it is because
you are at the helm.

Best,



Kathleen
