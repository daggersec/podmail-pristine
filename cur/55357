The White House
Office of the Press Secretary
For Immediate Release
June 09, 2015
Fact Sheet: Launching a Public-Private Partnership to Empower Climate-Resil=
ient Developing Nations
Today, delivering on a major commitment announced by President Obama at the=
 UN Climate Summit in New York last September, the Administration is announ=
cing the launch of an international public-private partnership to empower d=
eveloping nations to boost their own climate resilience. The partnership, C=
limate Services for Resilient Development, will provide needed climate serv=
ices =96 including actionable science, data, information, tools, and traini=
ng =96 to developing countries that are working to strengthen their nationa=
l resilience to the impacts of climate change. The partnership is launching=
 with more than $34 million in financial and in-kind contributions from the=
 U.S. Government and seven other founding-partner institutions from around =
the world: the American Red Cross, Asian Development Bank, Esri, Google, In=
ter-American Development Bank, the Skoll Global Threats Fund, and the U.K. =
Government.
Climate change threatens our entire planet. Globally, 19 of the 20 warmest =
years on record all occurred in the past two decades, and the impacts of cl=
imate change =96 including more intense storms and storm surge damage, more=
 severe droughts and heat waves, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and b=
iodiversity losses =96 are already being experienced around the world. Thes=
e impacts can be particularly damaging in developing countries, which often=
 lack the resources and technical capacity to effectively prepare for and a=
dapt to the effects of climate change.
No single entity is capable of addressing the vast needs for improved clima=
te services in these nations: for everything from projections of future sea=
-level rise that help planners identify places to build and develop that ar=
e out of harm=92s way, to maps that overlay population, infrastructure, and=
 climate data to help decision makers target resources to areas of greatest=
 vulnerability. To meet these needs, the new Climate Services for Resilient=
 Development partnership will harness the experience, unique capabilities, =
and resources of a broader set of societal actors and institutions, relying=
 on collaboration between the partners and local stakeholders to ensure lon=
g-term ownership and sustainability of the partnership=92s impact in focus =
countries.
The partnership announced today builds on significant progress<https://www.=
whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq/initiatives/resilience> made by the O=
bama Administration domestically to support communities across the United S=
tates in strengthening their resilience to the impacts of climate change, i=
ncluding by supporting climate resilient investments, planning for climate =
related risks, and providing tools and information for decision-makers. The=
 Administration is continuing to advance actions to address on-the-ground c=
limate-resilience needs. For example, the President=92s Fiscal Year (FY) 20=
16 Budget proposal includes $6 million to create a Resilience AmeriCorps pr=
ogram. And this year, the Administration will launch a pilot of the program=
 to support AmeriCorps members in assisting communities to plan for and add=
ress the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events.
About the Partnership:
The U.S. Government=92s involvement in the Climate Services for Resilient D=
evelopment partnership builds on the President=92s continued efforts to pos=
ition the United States as the leader in tackling climate change both domes=
tically and abroad. The partnership will enable the U.S. Government to appl=
y the technologies, scientific expertise, and capacities it has developed u=
nder the President=92s Climate Action Plan to support resilience efforts in=
 developing nations. The U.S. Government=92s involvement in the partnership=
 is being led by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), wit=
h the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oc=
eanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Geological Survey (US=
GS), and other U.S. Government agencies contributing climate data and tools=
 to meet the information needs of focus countries. The Peace Corps will dev=
ote some of its efforts to support on-the-ground implementation of climate-=
resilience activities.
In addition to the U.S. Government, the partnership includes seven other fo=
unding partners: the American Red Cross, Asian Development Bank, Esri, Goog=
le, Inter-American Development Bank, the Skoll Global Threats Fund, and the=
 U.K. Government. The Administration looks forward to others answering the =
call and growing the partnership.
In recognition of the global diversity of climate service needs, the partne=
rship will deliver tailored and targeted services to countries in sub-regio=
ns of Latin America (the Andean region and Caribbean), Africa (East Africa =
and the Sahel), and Asia (South Asia and Southeast Asia). The partnership=
=92s initial efforts will be organized around development and application o=
f scalable, replicable, comprehensive, and integrative climate services in =
focus countries representing each of these primary regions: Colombia (Latin=
 America), Ethiopia (Africa), and Bangladesh (Asia).
The U.S. Government already supports a number of successful programs in thi=
s domain that this new partnership will leverage and augment, including the=
 Climate Services Partnership, NOAA=92s International Training Desks and In=
ternational Research and Applications Project (IRAP), NASA and USAID=92s SE=
RVIR program, and the Global Resilience Partnership (GRP). Likewise, there =
are many institutions and programs in focus countries that the partnership =
will build on as a core component of its efforts.
Commitments from Founding Partners:
Today, the founding members of the Climate Services for Resilient Developme=
nt partnership are announcing significant commitments to complement existin=
g efforts, expertise, and capacities in order to enable the partnership to =
achieve its mission to increase resilience to climate change impacts in dev=
eloping countries:
=B7         American Red Cross: American Red Cross is part of the Internati=
onal Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which, with=
 13 million volunteers across national societies in 187 countries, is the w=
orld=92s largest humanitarian network. American Red Cross will draw on this=
 network to leverage existing in-country financial resources, staff, and on=
going programs in focus countries; connect local communities and civil soci=
ety with local and national government agencies and other institutions; qui=
ckly scale promising practices (for example, proven climate tools and educa=
tional games that enhance decision making) to other countries and promote u=
ptake of these practices; and deliver needed climate services to even remot=
e, hard-to-reach locations in focus countries. American Red Cross will also=
 work through two Global Reference centers focused on Climate and Disaster =
Preparedness to provide technical assistance informing policy, practice, an=
d research around enhancing climate risk management and will provide an end=
-user=92s perspective on how to tailor climate services to support strength=
ened decision making. Contributions from American Red Cross will build on o=
ther ongoing IFRC initiatives and existing partnerships, such as Global Fra=
mework for Climate Services, Building Resilience to Climate Extremes and Di=
sasters (BRACED), Partners for Resilience, Global Resilience Partnership, a=
nd Forecast Based Financing. Many of these efforts are coordinated through =
the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center.
=B7         Asian Development Bank: The Asian Development Bank will provide=
 in-kind contribution in the first phase of the partnership. This will incl=
ude support for the following activities in Asia: development and dissemina=
tion of climate services and products for more climate resilient investment=
s; training and capacity building on the use and interpretation of climate =
data and the assessment of risks for development planning; analysis of futu=
re climate change impacts on major sectors and critical infrastructures suc=
h as those for transport, water, energy, urban development and agriculture;=
 and climate change information and knowledge management portals.
=B7         Esri: Esri will donate access to its online mapping and analysi=
s collaboration platform to focus countries, and will assist with country c=
onfiguration and input of local data resources. This platform will provide =
access to foundational open spatial data sets, such as elevation, ecologica=
l land units, and climatological information products. After the collaborat=
ion platform is launched in a focus country, Esri will conduct an in-countr=
y training workshop for stakeholders. Esri will also provide thought leader=
ship =96 including repeatable climate information templates and tools, docu=
mented geospatial best practices, and a methodology for conducting capabili=
ties assessments =96 and will leverage its extensive network of 1,800 partn=
ers and over 350,000 user sites around the globe to encourage local knowled=
ge sharing and collaborations.
=B7         Google: In support of the launch<https://www.whitehouse.gov/the=
-press-office/2014/03/19/fact-sheet-president-s-climate-data-initiative-emp=
owering-america-s-comm> of the Administration=92s Climate Data Initiative<h=
ttp://www.data.gov/climate/> last year, Google committed to provide one pet=
abyte (1,000 terabytes) of cloud storage to house satellite observations, d=
igital elevation data, and climate and weather model datasets drawn from go=
vernment open data and contributed by scientists, as well as 50 million hou=
rs of high-performance cloud computing on the Google Earth Engine geospatia=
l analysis platform. To date, these resources have been used to ingest and =
create numerous datasets related to climate resilience including: downscale=
d (higher resolution) climate model forecast datasets (NASA), bias-correcte=
d global precipitation datasets (USGS and the University of California, San=
ta Barbara), global weather forecasts (NOAA), global digital elevation mode=
ls (NASA/USGS), global cropland extent (USGS), sea surface temperature obse=
rvations (NOAA), and updates to global forest change data products (Univers=
ity of Maryland). Google is committed to continuing to make these powerful =
computational resources available to support activities of the Climate Serv=
ices for Resilient Development partnership.
=B7         Inter-American Development Bank: As a founding member of the Cl=
imate Services for Resilient Development partnership, the Inter-American De=
velopment Bank will provide in-kind support to enhance the availability and=
 use of climate data and other climate services in Colombia and other Latin=
 and Caribbean countries. This support will include, among other projects, =
the development of a science and technology transfer program to help the sc=
ientific community in Latin America and the Caribbean use data and insights=
 from regional/global climate models, projections, and other numerical tool=
s to inform impact and vulnerability assessments of priority sectors; demon=
strations on how to incorporate climate change considerations into watershe=
d planning and management programs associated with high-mountain ecosystems=
; and efforts to strengthen the capacity of focus countries to monitor and =
evaluate the effects of climate change on local glacial dynamics and associ=
ated economic implications.
=B7         Skoll Global Threats Fund: Skoll Global Threats Fund works with=
 partners across South Asia to improve climate data and information transpa=
rency in the region. As part of this partnership, Skoll Global Threats Fund=
 will leverage its relationships and existing projects such as the South As=
ian Land Data Assimilation System with the International Centre for Integra=
ted Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Johns Hopkins University, and NASA; the =
Third Pole Project's climate and water data platform, and the World Resourc=
e's (WRI) Institute's Aqueduct platform. Skoll Global Threats Fund will pro=
vide financial support in 2015 to help carry out partnership activities.
=B7         U.K. Government: The U.K. Department for International Developm=
ent will provide financial support for coordinated provision of climate dat=
a and services in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In addition, the U.K. =
Met Office, which provides expert weather and climate-change forecasts for =
the public, business, and government in the United Kingdom and worldwide, w=
ill leverage its existing activities, expertise, and deep relationships wit=
h regional and national in-country meteorological services to support partn=
ership activities in Asia and Africa. This includes areas such as instituti=
onal and technical capacity development, weather service modernization, and=
 weather and climate data, information, and services in support of resilien=
ce.
=B7         U.S. Government: The U.S. Agency for International Development =
(USAID) will provide financial support for regional, country, and end-user =
needs assessments, as well as for implementing climate-service activities a=
nd products. Furthermore, USAID will build on its existing activities, such=
 as SERVIR and the Global Resilience Partnership, to support activities of =
the Climate Services for Resilient Development partnership. The U.S. Geolog=
ical Survey (USGS) will contribute high-resolution elevation data available=
 via a user-friendly format on its Earth Explorer website<http://earthexplo=
rer.usgs.gov/> to empower local authorities to better plan for the impacts =
of severe environmental disruptions related to climate change, such as drou=
ght, glacial retreat, flooding, landslides, coastal storm surges, agricultu=
ral stresses, and challenges concerning public health. The U.S. Government =
will also leverage ongoing efforts at NOAA, NASA, and other Federal agencie=
s that provide climate data and services.
Additional U.S. Government Commitments:
=B7         NASA: NASA is releasing a new Earth Exchange Global Daily Downs=
caled Projections (NEX-GDDP) dataset that provides downscaled climate model=
 outputs for every country in the world. These data are critical for resear=
chers conducting studies of climate-change impacts at sub-national scales, =
and the outputs support the development of information products that enhanc=
e public understanding of possible future climate patterns and impacts at l=
ocal and regional scales. The NEX-GDDP dataset represents a major expansion=
 of NASA=92s 2013 Earth Exchange Downscaled Climate Projections Dataset (NE=
X-DCP30). NEX-GDDP upgrades NEX-DCP30 by improving the temporal resolution =
of the data from monthly to daily averages, and broadening the geographic s=
cope of the data from the conterminous United States to the entire globe. T=
he NEX-GDDP dataset is publicly available HERE<http://dataserver.nccs.nasa.=
gov/thredds/catalog/bypass/NEX-GDDP/catalog.html>.
=B7         Peace Corps: The Peace Corps will continue to innovate its prog=
ramming to empower Volunteers worldwide to work with their host countries o=
n addressing the impacts of climate change at the grassroots level. The Pea=
ce Corps is signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the Pacific Regional=
 Environmental Programme, placing short-term technical Volunteers in Samoa =
to enhance local climate resilience. Volunteers in Ethiopia =96 one of the =
initial focus countries =96 are providing on-the-ground technical assistanc=
e and sustained engagement on climate change. The Peace Corps will also dev=
elop and launch an online climate-change community of practice, providing t=
raining modules, school activities, and other resources to help all Volunte=
ers and staff better understand climate-change impacts and support resilien=
ce and mitigation efforts through their work.
=B7         U.S.-U.K. Collaborative Arrangement: The U.S. Government is joi=
ning with the U.K. Government on providing climate data, products, and serv=
ices to support resilience and climate-smart development in developing coun=
tries around the world. This Collaborative Arrangement on Climate Data and =
Services for Resilience builds upon many decades of close scientific collab=
oration between the two countries. Under the arrangement, NOAA, USAID, the =
U.K. Department of International Development, and the U.K. Met Office will =
work together to share best practices and lessons learned in climate risk a=
ssessment and response, capacity-building in low-income countries, developi=
ng new and enhanced climate services to support climate resilience, and imp=
roving interfaces and platforms to help users easily access and exchange va=
luable climate information and services.
=B7         State Department: The State Department is announcing its =93ada=
ptation submission<http://unfccc.int/focus/adaptation/undertakings_in_adapt=
ation_planning/items/8932.php>=94 to the UN Framework Convention on Climate=
 Change (UNFCCC). Adaptation to the impacts of climate change is a challeng=
e for all countries. The United States is one of the first=FD countries to =
respond to the invitation made during the 2014 Lima Conference of Parties f=
or countries to communicate their efforts in adaptation planning. This subm=
ission reflects the U.S. Government=92s commitment to enhancing the resilie=
nce of the United States in the face of future climate uncertainties, as we=
ll as helping other vulnerable countries and communities do the same.
