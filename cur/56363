Hi Christina: <br><br>Just spoke with our energy folks about the line in th=
e speech on &quot;using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extr=
action to protect the environment&quot; -- a reference to reforming the roy=
alties paid for energy extraction on public land. Their only potential conc=
ern was that folks in the environmental=20
community will view this as a step towards a carbon tax (thus raising expec=
tations) -- whereas it&#39;s really going to be a more targeted proposal (i=
n line with some Obama Administration reforms) aimed at making sure that ta=
xpayers get their fair share in federal royalties.<br><br></div>We think it=
