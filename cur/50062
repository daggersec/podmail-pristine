Mike & Co. --
The legislative wheels in Washington are moving into gear slowly this year. =
  Everything will stop in its tracks though as the city becomes snowbound ov=
er the weekend.  Then when the streets clear, work will resume on some impor=
tant regulatory bills, though they and everything else on the Hill will face=
 tough sledding.=20
Three of these bills making their ways through Congress that would have the b=
iggest financial regulatory and political impact are reviewed below.=20
Stay warm and dry.=20
Best,
Dana
------
There are three especially salient legislative regulatory initiatives being d=
rafted or under consideration on the Hill that are more likely than most oth=
ers to see votes in Congress and could have bearing at some point on the cam=
paign or represent an opportunity in that context.=20
=E2=80=A2   The independent Agency Regulatory Analysis Act=20
A bipartisan measure introduced by Sens. Portman, Warner, and Collins to app=
ly CBA studies to financial rule making.  The bill, versions of which have b=
een introduced since 2012 without success, authorizes the president, through=
 the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, to require that the agenc=
ies conduct in-depth CBA in addition to considering =E2=80=9Cleast burdensom=
e=E2=80=9D regulations as well as the economic impact of their rules. =20
Critics claim that the purpose of the bill is to inject political considerat=
ions into these agencies and that the requirements would impose not only a c=
ost and time burden but would also limit the agencies=E2=80=99 ability to ra=
pidly respond to crises and drain resources.   Two agencies, the SEC and CFT=
C, are already required to undergo a type of cost-benefit analysis.  Traditi=
onal CBA, critics say, aren=E2=80=99t even an applicable method of accountin=
g when dealing with these agencies. =20
One of the bill=E2=80=99s own co-sponsors, Susan Collins, spoke out against t=
his very policy proposal only a few years ago, saying =E2=80=9CIf you bring t=
hese independent agencies within the regulatory purview of OIRA, you defeat t=
he whole purpose of having them be independent agencies.=E2=80=9D
CBA is one of rallying calls for opponents of the Dodd-Frank law to raise qu=
estions about agencies in an attempt to stall or overturn regulations.  In f=
act, opponents have had a number of successes with that approach in the last=
 decade.  Sen. Portman defended the bill, saying =E2=80=9C(the agencies are)=
 independent, so they should be immune from political influence -- but they s=
houldn't be immune from the laws of economics and common sense.=E2=80=9D =20=

Given the political climate of the upcoming election year, as well as the pa=
st failures of this bill, it=E2=80=99s not likely that this legislation will=
 take root but keep an eye on this bill, because it could make it even more d=
ifficult to implement remaining Dodd-Frank rules.  =20
 =E2=80=A2    SEC/Political Disclosure Rule=20
Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on a conference call today that =E2=80=9Csharehol=
ders have a right to know how companies spend their money.=E2=80=9D   To tha=
t end, she and Sens. Schumer, Menendez, and Merkley have called on the SEC t=
o draft a rule which would require that publically held companies disclose t=
heir political contributions to trade associations and political nonprofits.=

Though the omnibus government spending bill passed last month includes langu=
age preventing the commission from finalizing a corporate political disclosu=
re rule, =E2=80=9Cthere is nothing preventing the SEC from preparing the rul=
e this year," per Warren.  Sen. Schumer said that language preventing such a=
 rule could be =E2=80=9Cripped out root and branch=E2=80=9D during the next C=
ongressional appropriations cycle, leading the way for the SEC to finalize t=
he requirement.=20
This past August, 44 Senators sent the SEC chair a letter calling for politi=
cal spending disclosure.  In October, eight of the 10 Democrats on Banking w=
rote to the two nominees for SEC commission, expressing their support.  The b=
ill would be staunchly opposed by the GOP and business groups.   But due to s=
upport inside Congress and from the public, and with Sen. Warren championing=
 this initiative, observers should watch closely =E2=80=93 while the rule ma=
y not be particularly viable, the fight which it will stir up is the real pr=
ize involved. it will remain an issue to be closely watched in the coming mo=
nths. =20
=E2=80=A2   The DOL Fiduciary Rule
Rep. Wagner=E2=80=99s Retail Investor Protection Act passed the House in Oct=
ober and has been referred to Senate Banking.  The bill restricts the Depart=
ment of Labor from drafting any rules concerning when an individual is consi=
dered a fiduciary until 60 days after the SEC issues a final rule governing t=
he standards of conduct for brokers and dealers.
It also prevents the SEC from writing such a rule until it has reported to p=
articular congressional committees on a number of related matters, including=
 the impact of such rules (or their absence) on retail investors and whether=
 or not a standard fiduciary code of conduct would =E2=80=9Cadversely impact=
 retail investor access to personalized, cost-effective investment advice an=
d recommendations.=E2=80=9D   The goal of this legislation may be to entangl=
e the two organizations so fully that they cannot properly carry out their m=
andates.=20
Tying up the DOL and SEC=E2=80=99s rule-making abilities by connecting the t=
wo organizations is another step in the fight from the right against the cur=
rent regulatory climate.  Attempts to bog down regulators in regulations of t=
heir own, a sort of double-stack of regulations, may be a hallmark of this l=
egislative year.
