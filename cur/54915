Dear Recommender,

In preparation for the 2015 law clerk hiring season, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will archive OSCAR recommender  accounts that have not registered any activity for one year. The archiving will begin on January 12, 2015. OSCAR will remain available during this period. If your account is archived, you will no longer have access to any of your completed recommendation letters and recommendation letter templates. To retain copies of your completed letters and templates, you or your assistant will need to download them from OSCAR before January 12, 2015.

If an applicant requests a letter of recommendation from you after your account has been archived, a new account will be created for you with new login information, including a new password will be sent to you via email. The following instructions provide procedures on downloading completed recommendations and recommendation letter templates:

DOWNLOADING COMPLETED RECOMMENDATION LETTERS

After logging in, move your mouse cursor over View Completed Recommendations in the main navigation menu. Choose Clerkship Recommendations or Staff Attorney Recommendations from the drop-down menu. OSCAR displays a list of completed recommendation letters. In the Preview column of the list, click on the PDF document icon to download the recommendation letter you want to save. Make sure to open the downloaded letter, rename it, and save it to your preferred location.

DOWNLOADING RECOMMENDATION LETTER TEMPLATES

To save a letter of recommendation template, log into OSCAR, move your cursor over Fill Recommendation Requests in the main navigation menu, and click My Templates in the drop-down menu. OSCAR displays your list of letter templates. To open a template, click the Label. The system will then display the contents of the selected template in the online editor. Highlight and copy the contents of the online editor and paste into a new document on your computer.

Sincerely,

Administrative Office of the United States Courts
OSCAR Program Office
