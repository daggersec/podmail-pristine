Jake:

Feels more like a long-term investment, invest in U.S., anti-inversion event=
. A call for corporate patriotism about adding longterm value to US.=20

I would not do manuf Renniasance here because it makes it seem like problem i=
s we need more public investment when people will feel this is about corpora=
te profit-greed and lack of concern of workers and paying US back for its he=
lp.

One caution: whether it leads to a Nafta hit on HRC if they can show that Un=
ited can move to Mexico because it is easy to export to US due to Nafta.

[i am happy at some point to tell my eyewitness account of her opposing Naft=
a in 1992]

So bottom line: am for an event there on asking companies to care about corp=
orate patriotism and  longterm US investment and to care about workers -- st=
ressing impt of manuf. Would be a good hit - but just need to think thru and=
 research Nafta issue
