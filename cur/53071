Want to talk to the head of Greenpeace? Kumi Naidoo is a very well known
South African with a big international following, but I think GOI likely to
stick it to them. Separately, I am trying to help Ford Foundation which
also got on the wrong side of GOI, but whose case I think can be more
easily resolved.

    Dear John,

I hope you are enjoying this gorgeous Washington weather.  I  have had a
request from some colleagues at Greenpeace as they are facing  facing a
very serious situation in India.  In a nutshell: an Indian Intelligence
Bureau report was "leaked" alleging Greenpeace India was responsible for a
loss of 2-3% of the country=E2=80=99s GDP.  Since then the Ministry of Home=
 Affairs
has kept up a relentless attack of allegations of irregularities in their
registration and has now frozen all their bank accounts, both foreign and
domestic, despite a Delhi High Court ruling there was no basis for doing
so.  The bottom line is that without some kind of intervention, they will
have to close down by the end of June.  This has never happened to a
Greenpeace office in the entire history of the organization.

Kumi Naidoo was hoping to speak with you or to get advice on who might be
able to help behind the scenes explaining to people close to the Prime
Minister that their campaigns are about the issues of clean air and clean
water and not personal and their office should not be forced to close
because they have a different vision of India=E2=80=99s future.

 Apparently The Podesta Group has the contract for the Republic of India in
the US, but Kumi has no way to reach Tony or another prinicipal.

 Thanks in advance for any thoughts you might have.

 Best,

 Karen
