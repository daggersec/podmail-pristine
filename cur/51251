One thing I like about Jim=92s though is that it does include a direct refe=
rence to getting rid of =93decades of debt=94, which is the central pain po=
int people are feeling. I believe that the takeaway/quotable grafs have to =
invoke debt because that=92s the way we connect what she is doing directly =
back to their lives.

Maybe it=92s as simple as: It=92s time for a new college compact, where eve=

available to everyone willing to work for it =96 without saddling them with=
 decades of debt.

I think Jim's expansion risks sounding like an entitlement program too much=
.

I think we have to make our language true to the core of her plan and who s=
he is in demanding responsibility and accountability from everyone particip=
ating and wanting to participate in the college system.

 I don't think it's bad at all to say where Everyone does their part.
Compact works because it demands things from multiple place and echoing lan=
guage of basic bargain still feels right here.
And this isn't an entitlement so I think the affordable for everyone willin=
g to work for it gets at responsibility - which I think is a substantive di=
fference implicitly with Sanders and pushing against "free".

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
REMARKS ON COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND STUDENT DEBT
EXETER, NEW HAMPSHIRE
MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 2015

It=92s wonderful to be back in Exeter.  Thank you, Danny, for that introduc=
tion.  And thank you all for coming out today.  I=92ve been traveling all o=
ver New Hampshire, and everywhere I go =96 from Dover to Nashua to Glen to =
Windham =96 people ask great questions.  It must come from being the first =
primary state.  So today, I want to talk for just a little bit, and then I =
want to hear what=92s on your mind.

This election is about the choices we have to make as a country, and how th=
ey=92ll shape our children=92s and grandchildren=92s futures.  I believe th=
at, in America, if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to ge=
t ahead and stay ahead.  That=92s the basic bargain that=92s always set our=
 nation apart.  And I want to make sure we keep that bargain and strengthen=
 it, so it holds true for this generation and the next.

Thanks to your hard work =96 and the hard work of people across the country=
 =96 America has come back from the worst recession of our lifetimes.  We=
=92re standing again.  But we=92re not yet running the way we should.  Corp=
orate profits are near record highs =96 but most paychecks have barely budg=
ed.  Costs for everything from childcare to prescription drugs are rising f=
aster than wages. It=92s no wonder so many Americans feel like the deck is =
stacked in favor of those at the top.

We=92ve got to do better.  We=92ve got to get incomes rising again, so more=
 hard-working families can afford a middle-class life.  We need strong grow=
th=85 fair growth=85 and long-term growth.  That=92s how we=92ll achieve la=
sting prosperity =96 by building an economy that we all have a stake in, an=
d that works for everyone.

Today, I want to talk about one way we do that:  by making college affordab=
le and available to every American.

For millions of Americans, a college degree has been the ticket to a better=
 life.  My grandfather worked his entire life in a lace mill =96 but my dad=
 made it to college and was able to start his own small business, and that =
made a huge difference in our lives.  Then my parents scrimped and saved fo=
r years, so they could send me to a school across the country.  They knew t=
hat they were setting me on the path to a better future.  College still hol=
ds that promise today.  A lot has changed in this country =96 but that hasn=
=92t.

Across America, parents are starting college funds the day their kids are b=
orn.  High-schoolers =96 even middle-schoolers =96 are taking college prep =
courses and studying for the SAT.  Full-time workers are going to night sch=
ool, even if that means heading straight from an eight-hour shift to a pile=
 of homework.  If that=92s what it takes to get a better job =96 to give th=
eir kids better than they had =96 then they=92ll do it.

But here=92s the problem.  States are slashing education budgets.  Colleges=
 keep raising prices.  In-state tuition and fees for public colleges increa=
sed by 55 percent between 2003 and 2012.  But your incomes didn=92t rise by=
 that much, did they?  So families are left facing a painful choice.  Eithe=
r you say, =93We just can=92t afford it,=94 and pass up on all the opportun=
ities that a degree can offer =96 or you do whatever it takes to pay for it=
, even if that means going deeply into debt.

And more and more, that debt is holding people back.  Forty million America=
ns have student loans.  Together, they owe more than a trillion dollars.  N=
ew Hampshire=92s students are carrying the highest debt in the country.  An=
d millions of Americans are delinquent or in default.  Even if they=92re do=
ing everything they can to pay their loans, they just can=92t keep up.

The cost of this debt is real =96 not just on balance sheets, but in people=
=92s lives and futures.  I=92ve talked to people who have so much student d=
ebt, they=92ve put off buying a house, changing jobs, starting a business =
=96 even getting married.  I=92ve met parents and grandparents who=92ve co-=
signed loans and end up draining their savings or ruining their credit =96 =
all because they did what parents and grandparents are supposed to do =96 h=
elp out the next generation.

There are students who take out loans to pay for an expensive degree from a=
 for-profit institution =96 then graduate and discover that, when it comes =
to finding a job, their degree isn=92t worth what they thought it would.

And the 40 percent of students who never finish college are left with debt =
and no degree to show for it =96 the worst of both worlds.  And that non-co=
mpletion rate should trouble to all of us.  It=92s the highest in the devel=
oped world.

College is supposed to help people achieve their dreams.  But more and more=
, it=92s pushing people=92s dreams further out of reach.  And that=92s just=
 wrong.  It=92s a betrayal of everything college is supposed to represent =
=96 and everything families have worked so hard to achieve.

This is also about our national competitiveness.  The rest of the world is =
working as hard as they can to out-do us.  China plans to double the number=
 of students enrolled in college by 2030, which means they=92ll have nearly=
 200 million college graduates.  That=92s more than our entire workforce!  =
American workers can out-work and out-innovate anyone in the world =96 as l=
ong as they get the training and education they need to compete.

So we need to make some big changes.  We need to transform how much higher =
education costs =96 and how those costs get paid.  For too long, families h=
ave had to bear the burden of soaring prices, underinvestment, and too litt=
le accountability.

It=92s time for a new college compact, where everyone does their part.  We =
need to make a quality education affordable and available to everyone willi=
ng to work for it.

I=92ve been traveling the country for months, talking to students and famil=
ies, educators, legislators, and experts of every stripe =96 including youn=
g progressive activists who=92ve put the issue of debt-free college and col=
lege affordability at the top of the national agenda.

And today, I=92m announcing my plan to put college within reach for everyon=
e.  We=92re calling it the New College Compact.  And we=92re posting it on =
our website, Facebook, Medium, Snapchat =96 just about everywhere we can th=
ink of.  I hope you=92ll check it out.  But for now, here are the basics.

Under the New College Compact, schools will have to control their costs and=
 show more accountability to their students.

States will have to meet their obligation to invest in higher education.

The federal government will never profit off student loans.

No family =96 and no student =96 should have to borrow to pay tuition at a =
public college.

And everyone who has student debt will be able to refinance it at lower rat=
es.

That=92s my plan.  It=92s ambitious =96 and we should be ambitious.  But it=
=92s also achievable.  And it would make a big difference in people=92s liv=
es.

My College Compact comes down to two main goals.

First, we=92ll make sure that cost won=92t be a barrier.

Under my plan, you=92ll never have to take out a loan to pay for tuition at=
 an in-state public university.  We=92re going to make community college fr=
ee =96 that=92s President Obama=92s plan and we=92re making it ours too.  W=
e=92re reforming Pell Grants, so students can use them for living costs as =
well as tuition.  We=92re offering special help to college students who are=
 parents, because when you help a parent get an education, you=92re helping=
 their kids, too.

We=92re going to work with historically black colleges and universities, be=
cause they serve some of America=92s brightest students, who need the most =
support and too often have gotten the least of it.  And we=92re going to he=
lp pay for college for students who agree to national service.  If you=92re=
 willing to tutor America=92s kids or clean up our parks, the least we can =
do is support your education.

And second, we=92ll make sure that debt won=92t hold anyone back.

Under my plan, every borrower in America who already has student debt will =
get the chance to refinance at lower interest rates.  If you can refinance =
your mortgage or your car loan, you should be able to refinance your studen=
t loan.

If you do still end up taking out a loan =96 for example, to go to a privat=
e college =96 we=92ll cut your interest rates, so the government never make=
s a profit off your loan.

We=92ll make it easier to enroll in income-based repayment programs, so you=
=92ll never have to pay more than 10 percent of what you make.

We=92re going to help borrowers who are in default get back on their feet. =
 And we=92ll crack down on predatory schools and lenders and bill collector=
s.  If you defraud students, overcharge veterans, or mislead borrowers, we=
=92re going to do everything we can to stop you.

There=92s a lot more in my College Compact =96 from encouraging innovations=
 like online learning and apprenticeships, so students can earn their degre=
e in less time and move straight into a job=85 to strengthening the G.I. Bi=
ll, so more of our veterans can get their degree... to making sure colleges=
 spending federal dollars on things that benefit students, like teaching an=
d research =96 not marketing campaigns or big salaries for administrators.

I plan to make college affordability a major issue in this campaign =96 bec=
ause it=92s a major issue for millions of American families.  Here=92s the =
bottom line.  An education shouldn=92t be something just for those at the t=
op.  And it shouldn't be a burden.  An education should be affordable =96 a=
nd available =96 to everyone.

I remember how proud my parents were when I graduated college.  I remember =
how proud Bill and I were to see Chelsea graduate =96 I=92ll never forget h=
ow grown-up she looked that day.  And even though my new granddaughter is a=
lready growing up faster than I=92d like, I can=92t wait to see her walk ac=
ross a stage someday and receive her diploma. And I know that mothers and f=
athers and grandparents across the country feel the exact same way.

I want every young person in America to have their shot at that moment.  I =
want every hard-working parent out there to get the chance to see his or he=
r child cross a stage =96 or to cross it themselves.  America should be a p=
lace where those achievements are possible for anyone who=92s willing to wo=
rk hard to do their part.  That=92s the country I want to help build =96 fo=
r this generation and all the generations to come.

Thank you very much.  And now, let=92s hear from you.
