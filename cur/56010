John --

This could cost us the election.

The Romney campaign is up with a new ad campaign trying to confuse voters =
into thinking that Republicans are the ones trying to protect Medicare.

You and I know that Romney and Paul Ryan are dead set on slashing seniors' =
Medicare benefits to pay for more millionaire tax breaks -- but we have to =
get the facts out to voters immediately.

Stand with President Obama: Donate $3 or more to help us fight Republican =
attacks and set the record straight >> http://www.dccc.org/augkw-4

Our polls show that if voters have the facts, we'll win. But now we're =
facing millions of dollars in dishonest attacks distorting President =
Obama's record. We have to get our own ads on the air and organizers on =
the ground ASAP to set the record straight.

Please donate $3 or whatever you can to back up President Obama with a =
Democratic majority:
