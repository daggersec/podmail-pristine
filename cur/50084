Here are a few thoughts on great policy talent, to go along with
Comms/Press names I gave you.  All could be day to day policy director or
dep policy director material.

David Zikusoka -- he's about 32, Harvard grad, worked on '07-'08 policy
staff of Obama campaign doing domestic policy, foreign policy staffer for
Biden, and now at DoD.   Ugandan parents.  Ziggy is incredibly smart, hard
working and a delight to be around.  Jake Sullivan should know him well (he
worked for Jake when he was with Biden).

Wally Adeyamo -- he's about Ziggy's age, maybe a few years older.    Yale
law.   Worked for Geithner and Neil Wolin at Treasury, CFPB, and I'm not
sure where in Admin he is now but could track him down.   Whip smart,
serious, has management expertise so could run policy process.   I believe
he has worked on campaigns (maybe Edwards?) in past.

I would guess that both Ziggy and Wally would be very interested if role
was senior enough.  Three other people who might be good, though perhaps
harder to pull from what they are doing now:

Jason Green -- Yale Law, about 34, former Obama campaign staff, White House
counsel's office, now running a startup.   Very interested in long term
career in politics in Maryland.

Michelle Jawando -- former Gillibrand legislative director.  Now VP for
Legal Policy at CAP.

Deirdre Henry Spires -- superstar former senate finance committee staffer
when Baucus was chair, she was point on everything from tax policy to
unemployment to health care.   Jason Furman and I tried to get her high
ranking assistant secretary post at DOL when she left senate.   I think she
maybe took something at HHS with Sylvia. Very talented.   She's about 40,
with family, so may be tougher.  But she is great.
