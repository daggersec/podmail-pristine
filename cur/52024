Subject: incorporation papers

As some of you know, we've never formally filed papers for our =
501(c)(4).  For a variety of reasons, we think it makes sense to finally =
do that after Election Day.  We'll also rename it the "Obama-Biden =
Transition Project".  John has suggested that the five people listed on =
the incorporation papers will be the five of you.  There's nothing you =
need to do, but the press will obviously get a copy of the legal papers. =
 I just wanted to give you a heads-up in case you have any concerns.  =
(And if it makes any difference, we're getting directors and officers =
liability insurance for the transition.)
