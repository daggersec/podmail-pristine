Hello Mr. Podesta,

Thank you, again, for getting me in contact with the Michigan Grassroots
Office - I am enjoying the work that is brought to me! As you may know, I
will be in Washington this summer as a press relations intern in
Congressman Kildee's Office (during May and June) and a legislative intern
- focusing on education and budget - in Senator Stabenow's Office (during
July and August). If there is any work that you would like to have me do
while I am in DC, I would be happy to help in any way possible!

*Let Hillary be our champion!*

Best,

Ronald E. Owens III
