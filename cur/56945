Hey folks,

Wanted to draw you attention to this video we released today to show the
real faces of the healthcare crisis:

Dear MoveOn member,

Last week we asked MoveOn members to share photos showing how they and thei=
r
loved ones are suffering under our broken health care system.

The responses simply blew us away. We showed the photos to recording artist=
s
R.E.M., and together we produced this incredibly powerful video.

Watch the video and share it with your friends today.

 <http://pol.moveon.org/healthcare_cantwait/?id=3D17196-6704473-VgDhKFx&t=
=3D2>

With the news that some in the White House are considering a "trigger"1=97a
delay tactic designed to kill the public option=97it's more important than
ever to get the word out that we simply can't afford to wait for real
reform.
