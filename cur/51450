=20
Time to Just Say No to Giant Corporate =E2=80=9CParasites=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94=
and  Recognize Them for=20
What They Are=20

Sounds like a movie script.  Giant parasites stalk the American  landscape=
=20
disguised as benign upstanding participants in the =E2=80=9Cfree market.=E2=
=80=9D  =20
The dictionary defines parasite as:=20
=E2=80=9CAn organism that lives on or in an organism of another  species, k=
nown as=20
the host, from the body of which it obtains  nutriment.=E2=80=9D=20
In fact, there  are a number of major corporations in America who do very=
=20
little productive  work =E2=80=93 never making products or delivering servi=
ces that=20
benefit their  consumers.  Instead, the profits  they earn and the big CEO=
=20
salaries they pay are derived by sucking or skimming a  portion of the doll=
ars=20
they have convinced the Government to send through their  corporate=20
accounts =E2=80=93 generally to perform a function that is or ought to be a=
n  inherently=20
governmental function.=20
Ironically, many of these corporate  parasites are the loudest defenders of=
=20
=E2=80=9Cfree markets=E2=80=9D and the most vociferous  opponents of =E2=80=
=9Cgovernment takeovers,
=E2=80=9D when in fact they exist by feeding off the  taxpayers.=20
Three examples  have been in the news of late:=20
1). Banks that provide government guaranteed  student loans. The house=20
voted yesterday to end its four-decade practice of  subsidizing private len=
ders=20
to make student loans.  Since the 1960=E2=80=99s, the government has  subsi=
dized=20
banks to lend students money and guaranteed lenders against loss if  studen=
ts=20
defaulted.  =20
But since the  early 1990=E2=80=99s the government itself has done direct l=
ending=20
for many student  loans and avoided paying the subsidy to the banks. Why,=
=20
after all, should banks  take a percentage of every dollar to generate loan=
s if=20
the taxpayers guarantee  the loan in full?  In fact, it turns  out that the=
=20
government =E2=80=93 which, after all, has a responsibility to provide  hig=
her=20
education to its citizenry =E2=80=93 can provide loans directly at a much c=
heaper  price=20
than it can through the banks. =20
In fact it=E2=80=99s  estimated that eliminating the subsidy to the banks w=
ill save=20
$40 billion that  can be transferred into the Pell Grant program that=20
provides college grants to  moderate and low income students.=20
2). Private military contractors that provide  security services. One of=20
the things that defines civilized society is that  the government has a=20
monopoly on the use of lethal force.  Yet over the last decade private  mil=
itary=20
security firms have exploded.  They have been hired with increasing frequen=
cy=20
to do essentially  governmental security functions.  We=E2=80=99ve seen the=
 results=20
in the murders of civilians by Blackwater  operatives in Iraq.  And the=20
growth of free-standing,  mercenary armies that are available for hire by=
=20
governments around the world is  a danger to international security.  =20
But these  contractors are also economic parasites, since they charge a=20
great deal more to  do functions that could otherwise be performed by the=
=20
government. In fact, most  of their personnel are trained by the American=
=20
military.  After they leave the service and go to  work making much more th=
an they=20
would if they re-enlisted for another turn with  the Army or Marines. Then,=
=20
the Blackwaters of the world turn around and bill  their people out at huge=
=20
markups so that the taxpayers =E2=80=93 who paid for their  training in the=
 first=20
place =E2=80=93 have to pay a corporation for the privilege of  hiring them=
 back at=20
much higher rates.  =20
3). Private health insurance companies.  These are the granddaddy of all=20
parasitic operations.  Remember that every other industrial  society has lo=
ng=20
since decided that financing the health care of its citizens is  an=20
inherently governmental function =E2=80=93 that it is cheaper and much more=
  consistent with=20
our values =E2=80=93 to provide health care to all as a  right.=20
With that  approach, every other industrial society pays 50% less than we=
=20
do per person for  health care and, according to the World Health=20
Organization, 36 countries have  better health care outcomes than we do in =
the U.S.=20
Remember that  health insurance companies don=E2=80=99t provide an iota of =
health=20
care services.  They do hire an army of claims agents to  deny claims for=
=20
coverage, and another army of salesmen and admen to sell you  policies that=
 you=20
would automatically have in most other countries.  They simply take your=20
money, skim off  profits and CEO salaries and then =E2=80=93 once they get =
their end =E2=80=93
 pay for your  health care.  =20
We know that  the one thing government does very well is to spread risk =E2=
=80=93
manage insurance  pools.  Medicare and Social Security  are two of the most=
=20
successful programs in history.  And the health care financing  authorities=
 in=20
countries like France and Spain are pretty  good at it too. =20
The so-called =E2=80=9CMedicare Advantage=E2=80=9D program is a great  exam=
ple of a=20
side-by-side comparison of how the private insurance companies  compare wit=
h=20
government run insurance programs. Medicare Advantage was set up by  the Bu=
sh=20
Administration and Republican Congress to allow private insurance  companie=
s to=20
skim off a share of Federal Medicare dollars.  Originally, the private=20
insurance  companies claimed they would provide these services more efficie=
ntly=20
than the  =E2=80=9Cgovernment.=E2=80=9D  But it turned out  they required a=
 14% to 19%=20
subsidy above the normal costs of Medicare.  =20
As the _Economic Policy  Institute_=20
(http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/pm142/)  has pointed out, =E2=80=9CI=
n a nut shell, Medicare Advantage  plans are=20
private plans funded through Medicare to provide similar benefits,  but at =
a=20
14% higher cost on average, according to the Medicare  Payment Advisory=20
Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency. Eliminating these=
=20
overpayments would  free up $157 billion over 10 years, a substantial down =
payment=20
on health  care reform.=E2=80=9D   =20
Now the private  insurance industry is battling tooth and nail to prevent a=
=20
public health  insurance program from competing for its non-Medicare=20
business.  They want to continue to skim their  share off of every health c=
are=20
dollar they  can.=20
In fact, they  hope that the final insurance reform bill will require=20
people to buy  their products without any competition from a public plan or=
 rate=20
regulation to  limit the amount they can skim into the hands of Wall Street=
=20
investors and  CEO=E2=80=99s. =20
That=E2=80=99s why  President Obama has proposed that the final health insu=
rance=20
reform bill include  a robust public health insurance option that doesn=E2=
=80=99t=20
leave us with a  mandate to buy insurance from a monopoly of private insure=
rs=20
(that are, by the  way, also exempt from the anti-trust laws). That would j=
ust=20
guarantee a  government-mandated stream of revenue on which the private=20
insurance companies  can feed.=20
Of course, corporate parasites like these have always  existed.  But they=
=20
have burgeoned  over the last several decades as some of the best and=20
brightest graduates of our  universities have been convinced that they woul=
d be =E2=80=9C
chumps=E2=80=9D to go out and  create products and services that provide va=
lue to the=20
economy. Much better to  work for a corporate parasite that can make huge=
=20
sums of money simply by  convincing government to keep directing huge strea=
ms=20
of revenue through its  corporate coffers and then slicing off its share as=
=20
the money comes by. =20
It=E2=80=99s time for the age of the corporate parasite to come  to an end =
=E2=80=93=20
otherwise, we=E2=80=99re the =E2=80=9Cchumps=E2=80=9D.=20
