You are seeing her Wednesday. They are thrilled with the trip and want to
make sure they are good partners in follow up. Big ask from them before end
of term is the EO on governance. Probably should be ready to give them some
guidance on that.

John,

Thank you for your time today. You will never know how many Alaska Native
lives you have impacted and continue to impact.

It is safe to say that Alaska Native peoples life opportunities expand
based on your work. (as so many other people's around the world)

Wishing you a great life with the knowledge you have really made a
difference.

Sincerely,

Julie


Julie Kitka, President
Alaska Federation of Natives

Ps watch April 16th Peruvian Presidential elections. Tell Hilary about this
too.
She knows Hernando.
