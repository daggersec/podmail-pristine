Hi John,


It was nice to see you briefly over Thanksgiving and was sorry to miss the
signature cocktail!

Mae passed along your email as I was hoping to find a time to get together,
at your convenience, as I am considering a career transition and am very
interested in your input and general advice.


In my current position as Director of Partnerships for The Menkiti Group/
KWCP, a rapidly growing real estate brokerage and development company, I
have had the opportunity to engage with a broad spectrum of DC
organizations. It has been a tremendous experience to be involved with and
witness the transformation of the city and exciting to be a part of an
entrepreneurial group. However, as an experienced connector in the private
sector and with my previous roots in fundraising for both non profits and
campaigns I wanted to consider what other possibilities there might be
beyond the world of real estate.


I am in DC until 12/27 then to Mexico for a week for our family vacation
and would very much appreciate the opportunity to get together so please
just let me know what might work best for you.



Many thanks,

Marguerite Thompson
