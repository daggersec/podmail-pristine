John --

More than 1 million supporters took our survey last week,
sharing feedback on their 2012 campaign experience and how
they'd like to see us move forward. While we're still
sorting through all of the responses, I wanted to share
some initial results:

-- An overwhelming majority of survey respondents reported
feeling welcomed and included, that their time was used
effectively, and that there was a clear understanding of
how their work directly helped re-elect President Obama.

-- Among those of you who volunteered at least a few hours,=20
a majority went into a field office, though many of you got=20
involved instead through the campaign's online tools such=20
as Dashboard and the call tool.=20

-- About 1 in 10 survey respondents are interested in
running for office at some point, using their organizing
skills to continue fighting for real and lasting change.
That level of political engagement is inspiring.

-- Almost half of all survey respondents forwarded campaign
emails, and more than one-third communicated with friends
on Facebook -- both great ways to pass along information
about the President's positions and plans, as well as
opportunities to get involved.

-- Nearly 80 percent of survey takers want to keep
volunteering, primarily around the President's legislative
agenda.

Many of you shared comments and personal anecdotes. Here
are just a few that made me smile:

"When our field office opened, my husband, 12-year-old
daughter, and I were there almost every day. My daughter
and I even took a leadership role -- she was our tally
captain! This is the kind of experience that changes your
life. My children not only have a better understanding of
the political system but also have a firsthand experience
of how community engagement can make a difference. On
Election Night, they felt that difference. They were so
excited for the President because they had a sense of
ownership -- they had personally helped him achieve the
win. On Election Night, I truly believed we were all
winners." -- Kerry, California

"It made me feel good to see the enthusiasm of volunteers
at the local level (who become friends) ... great to see
teens through seniors, men and women, any race and faith
all working together for something we believed in (even if
we weren't there for the same issues) ... it assured me I
was doing the right thing..." -- William, Virginia

I feel more confident as an individual -- I can make a
difference in election results! I was talking about this
with my son today, he's a public school teacher, and he has
new faith in our electoral system also! Let's keep doing it
-- this is democracy as it should be!" -- Andrea, California

There's a lot more to be proud of -- check out this blog
post for some other incredible numbers on the work you all
did in the field:

http://my.barackobama.com/The-Campaign-in-Numbers

And here are a few comments from supporters like you about
the road ahead. We fought for the chance to continue moving
our country forward for the next four years, and it's up to
each one of us to follow through on this remarkable
opportunity:

"This organization has tapped into the enthusiasm of
Americans that were previously on the sidelines of the
political process. These Americans are now fully engaged
and aware of the policies that are being advanced that will
impact their lives and the lives of future generations.
They are excited, ready, and willing to do whatever is
within their power to influence policy makers to pass
legislation that reflects and responds to the issues of our
times." -- Rita, Virginia

"Create an engaged community of people that keeps the
momentum alive and ensures that progressive policy is
implemented at local, state, and national levels. Community
here is the operative word! Build and enhance local
organizing groups. Would be happy to be included in a local
group and lead such a group." -- Merida, Illinois

"Don't let the energy of the re-election slip through your
fingers. This is a very powerful network of people." --
Joel, Texas

We're going to put your survey responses to good use. Over
the next month or two, a team of campaign staff from across
the country is working on a project to document and analyze
the work we did over the past 19 months, identifying both
strengths and areas for improvement. Our goal is to pass
along what we've learned from the 2012 campaign.

You're the reason President Barack Obama was re-elected in
2012, and your input from surveys and calls is
crucial to this project. So please stay tuned. We're
putting together a final report that will be available to
the public, so that your voices continue to shape the future.

Our work is far from done -- you helped make sure of that.
President Obama, as always, is counting on us to help pass
his agenda and continue to make this country a better place
for every American.

There's more to come. Thanks for all you've done and will do.
