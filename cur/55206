Dear Friends:

Our opponent Scott Garrett has said things and voted on bills that comp=
letely go against what our district believes -- but this takes the cake=
=2E

On Friday, he said he refused to pay Republican membership dues because=
 his Party supports gay candidates=2E Then he co-sponsored a bill givin=
g businesses the right to refuse service for same-sex couples=2E

So it=E2=80=99s pretty clear, Scott Garrett does not believe in equalit=
y=2E

Please stand with Josh and sign on to denounce Scott Garrett=E2=80=99s =
homophobic quotes and actions=2E

Just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court confirmed the constitutional ri=
ght for all to marry and yet Scott Garrett has joined a radical minorit=
y doing everything they can to interfere with the Court's ruling=2E=C2=A0

We need to stand up and tell Garrett enough is enough! We=E2=80=99re ti=
red of his extreme positions and we want a moderate, solutions-oriented=
 representative who truly reflects our views and values=2E

Add your name now to denounce Scott Garrett=E2=80=99s anti-equality vie=
ws:=C2=A0Here!

Thanks for signing on,

Team Gottheimer
