Dear John,

It  has been a busy couple weeks in Washington, DC, from the all-night
budget fight  to President  Obama's announcement of five new national
monuments which  includes some of the country's most beautiful wild
places. LCV is on the front  lines of environmental protections and
your partnership as a member of the  Environmental Majority Council is
essential to our success. Read on to see some  of the most important
recent updates and ways you can continue to take action  to protect
our planet.

Thank  you for being a partner in this work.

LCV  Launches Field Campaign to Elect Climate Champion Ed Markey

On  March 11, LCV announced the launch of a grassroots field
campaign to help elect  Ed Markey as the next United States Senator
from Massachusetts. Since his first  election to the U.S. House in
1976, Markey has consistently been the one of the  strongest voices in
the House of Representatives on addressing climate change,  protecting
the environment, and promoting clean energy. And we need his voice  in
the Senate. LCV will spend at least $650,000 on this field campaign by
the  Democratic Senate primary on April 30th, knocking on at least
219,000 doors of  likely primary voters across the state.

LCV talked to many of these same voters during our successful
grassroots campaign to elect  Senator Elizabeth Warren last year. In
that race, we spent more than $870,000  on a field campaign to defeat
then-Senator Scott Brown, and knocked on more  than 400,000 doors in
Massachusetts. LCV knows how to win races and we're  looking forward
to bringing another environmental champion to the Senate.

Stop the Dangerous Keystone XL Pipeline!

This  is it: Big Oil and other dirty polluters are pulling out all the
stops to get the  Keystone XL tar sands pipeline built. They know that
a final decision is  expected this year and they see an opening to get
it done. But anyone who  thinks that the pipeline won't have a
devastating effect on our climate has got  their heads in the (tar)
sand! The pipeline would transport the dirtiest oil on the planet
right through the middle of our country, resulting in far more  global
warming pollution than conventional oil and threatening our precious
waterways with disastrous spills.

If  we sit back, if we don't take action right now, this climate
nightmare could be  Big Oil's next big win with devastating effects.
The State Department recently  came out with a completely unacceptable
report about the environmental impacts  of the dangerous Keystone XL
tar sands pipeline and in response the campaign to stop this massive
threat to our  climate is shifting into high gear. Click here to
submit your comment to the  Obama administration that they must reject
this dirty pipeline: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3D1I7EPs_6oLncEMJ7vWHu1=

Big Votes on Climate, Clean Air, and  Keystone XL on the Senate's
Budget Resolution

Last  week, the Senate voted on several high-profile environmental
issues during a late-night  "vote-a-rama" that included close to 100
amendments to Senator Patty Murray's Budget  Resolution, the Senate
counterpart to the infamous Ryan budget in the House. While  the
Murray budget does not have the force of law, the amendment votes were
symbolically important as measures of the Senate's support on some of
our top priority  issues.

The  good news is that a bipartisan majority of Senators stood with
the environment  to oppose two high-profile amendments: one, to defund
efforts by federal agencies to reduce carbon pollution that is
causing climate change, failed 53-46 on a 60 vote threshold, and
another, which  sought to weaken the EPA's landmark Mercury and Air
Toxics Standards, the first  ever national limits on toxic mercury
pollution from power plants, failed on a  46-53 vote. These strong
votes to defeat these amendments underscore support  for the EPA's
work protecting public health and holding polluters
accountable.=A0

The  bad news is that Big Oil bought itself a meaningless victory on
an amendment,  which passed 62-37, supporting approval and
construction of the dangerous  Keystone XL tar sands pipeline. This
amendment doesn't change the fact that the  ultimate decision remains
with President Obama.=A0But we must hold Senators accountable for
siding with Big Oil, especially those otherwise pro-environment
Senators who  flip-flopped on this issue since it came up for a vote
last year. Stay tuned  for more on LCV's accountability efforts.

GREAT NEWS: Shell Won't Drill in the  Arctic!

Shell Oil Company just announced earlier  this month that they will
not drill in the Arctic Ocean in 2013. To date almost  92,000 LCV
members=A0have signed our petition to get Shell out of the  Arctic.
And now, in the face of so much grassroots pressure, they have decided
that they won't move forward with their irresponsible project this
year.

But this good news comes with a  caveat. Shell promises to "pause"
drilling this year, not shut it down  altogether. If we want Shell to
keep its dirty rigs and unsafe equipment out of  our pristine Arctic
waters, we need our government to take a stand against  Arctic
drilling.

With your help, we can keep the momentum  going and win this campaign.
Will you join us in calling on the Obama administration  to oppose
Shell's dangerous Arctic drilling plans?=A0 http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=

LCV & State LCVs Annual Conference in May

Please  join me for LCV and State LCVs Annual Conference, which will
be held on May  2-4, 2013 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This year we will
also be convening a  special Partners in Conservation event on May
3rd. This will offer a unique  opportunity for members of the
environmental funding community from across the  country to
collaborate, learn, and strategize with the members of the state
league movement. =A0We are at a  crossroads. We can either rebuild
power to solve the greatest environmental  challenges before us, or we
can allow special interests to gut longstanding  environmental
regulations and foster inaction on the climate crisis. The next
generation is counting on us to safeguard our planet. With your
partnership, we  will succeed.

For more information on Partners in  Conservation and the Annual
Conference, please  contact Will Roberts at (206) 631-2639 or
Will_Roberts@lcv.org. You won't want to miss this chance to shape the
future of  the environmental movement.
