> =20
> We think that there are a couple of impacts of today's Supreme Court decis=
ion.  That decision found the two-year aggregate limits on individual giving=
 to federal candidates, PACs and political parties to be unconstitutional.  T=
he decision does not affect the underlying limits that an individual can max=
 out at, e.g., $2600 to a candidate for the primary and for the general elec=
tions, $5000 annually to a PAC, $10,000 annually to a state party, and $32,4=
00 annually to the DNC, DSCC or DCCC.  These limits all stay in effect.
> =20
> The aggregate limit is where an individual is capped at $123,200 to all fe=
deral committees over two years, within which there are additional caps of $=
46,600 total to all federal candidates and $74,600 to all parties and PACs. =
 These were thrown out.  Now, an individual can give to (1) as many federal c=
andidates ad he/she wants, observing the $2,600 per election max, (2) as man=
y PACs as he/she wants, observing the $5000 annual max, (3) as many state pa=
rties as he/she wants, observing the $10,000 annual max, and (4) all three n=
ational party committees (DNC, DSCC, and DCCC), still observing the $32,400 =
 annual max. =20
> =20
> Consequently:
> =20
> =C2=B7         The notion that out-of-cycle candidates are siphoning off f=
unds from in-cycle candidates will no longer be true.  In the past, it was a=
rgued that presidential candidates should not start fundraising prior to the=
 mid-term elections, because they will draw donors away from the mid-term ca=
ndidates, and then the donors will have less funds available to help with th=
e Senate and the House due to the overall cap.  Since a donor may now give t=
o as many federal candidates as he/she see fit, that is no longer true.
> =20
> =C2=B7         Parties will be able to raise more federal funds.  In the p=
ast, donors had to choose between the DNC, DSCC and DCCC (and similarly for t=
heir Republican counterparts), because the aggregate overall limit of $74,60=
0 did not leave enough max-out room for three contributions of $32,400 each.=
  Now donors can max out to each committee if they wish, as well as to as ma=
ny of the state parties as they desire.
> =20
> =C2=B7         Parties will be able to hold joint fundraising events among=
 the three national party committees and all of the state party committees a=
nd ask the wealthiest and willing donors to max out, or at least to contribu=
te as much as possible.  Theoretically, the joint fundraiser could ask a don=
or to max out at $607,200 consisting of $32,400 for three party committees, a=
nd $10,000 to fifty state parties plus DC (or double that at $1,214,000 for s=
pouses).
> =20
> =C2=B7         Presuming that most donors have limited funds available  to=
 contribute, this result could move some money from the SuperPACs where no c=
andidate coordination is permitted back to the political parties, where some=
 candidate coordination is permitted.  In other words, donors may see a bene=
fit in giving to the parties where they can have discussions about party spe=
nding, knowing that the parties are talking to the candidates.  Campaigns ma=
y see a benefit in encouraging wealthy donors to give to the parties, becaus=
e in the general election the campaigns can have more influence, if not cont=
rol, over the coordinated party spending (party independent expenditures mus=
t still be walled off and not coordinated; nothing changes about that).
> =20
> Let us know if you have any questions.  Also let me know if you would like=
 me to send this to anyone else.
