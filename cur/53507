Jake,

Sleeping on it, and having a chance to read the story about the Malik visa =
in the NYT, I think we need to devote some thought to  Jim Margolis's conce=
rn about HRC's record as SecState and visas.  I could easily see a question=
 like this:

"We've known since 9/11 that people intending to do us harm were getting vi=
sas to come here, and now it turns out that Tashfeen Malik got a visa to co=
me to the United States just a few months after you left the State Departme=
nt - even though she had posted material online, while you were Secretary o=
f State - indicating support for violent jihadists.   President Obama has n=
ow ordered a review of these visa programs, and is talking about suspending=
 some.  Why didn't you do more as Secretary of State to tighten visa progra=
ms that are now - after the fact - under review, and why didn't you order o=
fficials to review social media postings as part of the visa process?"

That is, it is just a matter of time before the Republicans (certainly) and=
 the media (likely) begin to try to use San Bernandino as a sign that thing=
s were broken while she was Sec State and that she did not do enough to fix=
 them.   And I don't know if saying, "Hey, this really wasn't a problem unt=
il after I left State" is going to cut it.  That is, someone (a Democratic =
opponent now, a moderator, or a Republican opponent later) takes her line -=
 "the first job of any President is to keep the American people safe" - and=
 says, "Well, it's also the first job of a Secretary of State too - and wha=
t did you do about it while you were Sec State?"

Ron
