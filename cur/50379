Hi there,

What happens in Virginia doesn't stay in Virginia.

I'm Wendy Davis. I took a stand earlier this summer and
filibustered Rick Perry's dangerous attempt to limit women's
access to health care in Texas. If you were one of the
thousands who stood with me that night: thank you.

But Rick Perry didn't invent the idea of trying to legislate women's=20
health centers out of existence.

Ken Cuccinelli fought for years to impose medically
unnecessary regulations on women's health centers in
Virginia. He won that fight and one center has already shut
down. Since then similar laws spread to Ohio, to North
Carolina, and of course to Texas.

But we can stop this assault on women's access to health
care before it goes any further.

Donate $5 to Terry's campaign to defeat Ken Cuccinelli and
show his allies that there's a real political cost of taking
access to health care away from women:

https://donate.terrymcauliffe.com/standwithterry

When I stood up in Texas, I was overwhelmed by the number of
people who stood with me.

Concerned Texans packed the gallery that night making it a
true people's filibuster.

Tens of thousands of people around the country tweeted,
emailed, and amplified our message to keep the fight going.

And hundreds of Virginians dug deep to contribute to our
fight in Texas, because they couldn't watch idly while Texas
women lost access to health care.

Now it's my turn to return that favor to Virginia's women.

My friend Terry McAuliffe believes women should be able to
make their health decisions with their doctor -- and without
extreme politicians trying to impose their agenda.

Electing Terry sends a powerful message about the strength
of women and our allies when we band together.

Donate $5 right now to show Ken Cuccinelli, Rick Perry, and
all of their allies scheming to push this kind of
legislation that we're only getting stronger:
