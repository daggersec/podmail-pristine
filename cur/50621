BREAKING NEWS:

DEMOCRATIC $11 BILLION SPENDING CUTS PLAN FAILS IN STATE SENATE -
REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO BACK PLAN UNLESS CUTS ARE LARGER

Democratic Plan for $1.9 Billion In New Tax Increases Not Brought Up For A
Vote In State Senate Today - Steinberg Says Democrats Will Not Support
Elimination of Healthy Families, CalWORKS, IHSS - State Officials Warn
California Just Days Away From Fiscal Disaster

 

SACRAMENTO, CALIF  (CDCAN) [Updated 06/24/09  11:45 AM  (Pacific Time)  -
As the State moves just days closer to what state budget officials call a
"fiscal disaster", the Democratic proposed budget plan to cut spending,
contained in AB 180,  failed passage in the State Senate late this morning,
failing to get any Senate Republican votes.  The initial vote was 22 to 16
(the vote total can change - but the outcome is unlikely to change with
Senate Republican opposition).  

 

The Assembly is considering an identical plan in SB 62, and is still
debating the measure - though it is certain to fail, as it did in the State
Senate.    

 

Senate and Assembly Democrats only presented today the spending cuts portion
of their budget plan, and not the proposal to raise taxes by $1.9 billion.
The Governor's revised budget plan submitted to the Legislature in May did
not contain any proposals for tax increases.  

 

The Governor did agree  to temporary tax hikes in January for the 2009-2010
State Budget that was passed by the Legislature in February - four months
early.  Legislative Republican leaders at the time backed the temporary tax
hikes over the strong objections of several of their own members.  While
their support and votes made it possible to pass the 2009-2010 State Budget
in February, it resulted in the ouster of those Republican leaders, and less
likely now that any agreement can be reached in the coming days that will
include any new tax increases .  

 

Democratic Spending Cuts Plan Has Major Cuts - But Differs From Governor's
Plan

The Democratic spending cuts plan while rejecting many of the Governor's
proposals that he made in May that called for elimination of several major
programs and rollback in eligibility that would have impacted over 360,000
children and adults in the In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) program, still
would make major cuts to those programs.  The spending cuts plan by the
Democrats contains the same proposed cuts to regional center funded
community-based services that the Governor proposed in May.  

 

While legislation to cut spending does not require 2/3rds vote to approve it
(54 votes in the 80 member Assembly and 27 votes in the 40 member State
Senate), it a super majority vote is needed to pass urgency (emergency)
legislation to take effect immediately.  That means the 25 Senate Democrats
need at least 2 Senate Republican votes.  In the Assembly that means the 50
Assembly Democrats need at least 4 Assembly Republican votes (there is 1
vacancy in the Assembly).

 

Legislation that is not passed as an "urgency" bill, that are passed with
simple majority votes in both houses and approved by the Governor would not
take effect until 90 days after it is signed into law.  

 

Steinberg Said Senate Democrats Will Not Eliminate Key Programs

Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg (Democrat - Sacramento) said the
Democratic plan reminded members that the proposed reduction of over $11
billion, though less than what the Governor proposed in May, is on top of
spending cuts of over $15 billion passed as part of the 2009-2010 State
Budget in February and in addition to the $11.4 billion in cuts made as part
of the 2008-2009 State Budget passed in September.  

 

Steinberg said that the Democratic plan maintains a "safety net for the most
vulnerable Californians" while making major cuts but warned Senate
Republicans that there were certain reductions Senate Democrats would not
make. 

 

"We don't sign pledges on our side of aisles but we will not eliminate the
Healthy Families program, we will not eliminate CalWORKS, we will not
eliminate In-Home Care, that will not happen.  Respectfully, forget about it
- it is not going to happen," Steinberg said.  

 

He asked Senate Republicans if they have a $24 billion plan to close the
deficit - and would they disclose it before July 1 and have the votes to
pass it.  

 

Senate Republican Leader Dennis Hollingsworth (Republican - Murrieta) said
"we have to solve a $24 billion problem" but said the Democratic plan in $11
billion spending cuts  was a "partial and incomplete" solution.  

 

Hollingsworth said that the plan is "not a solution.  We share the
Governor's concern, the Controllers' concern and the Treasurer's concern.
We have eight days before the state's checks are no good and we have to
issue IOU's..we have to get serious and solve the problem. Let's get that
done."

 

NEXT STEPS

*         The proposed spending cuts in the Democratic plan cannot take
effect unless it is passed by both houses and is signed by the Governor.

*         Leadership from both houses and the Governor will need to work out
a budget solution though it is not clear at this point where agreement can
be reached, with legislative Republicans strongly opposing any new tax
increases - and legislative Democrats opposing the larger spending cuts -
including major program eliminations - as proposed by the Governor.  

*         No further public hearings on the budget - the issues is before
the full Assembly and State Senate, though no further votes are scheduled
for this week.
