Thank you John and Ann.  Here is a update and some next steps.

Last night I spoke with Kari/Team NH and the NH NEA Exec Board unanimously
endorsed HRC!  I think they are working on a statement for Monday.
Hopefully that gets some notice by NEA and other state NEAs. Scott their
President is willing to make calls to other State Presidents. Kari will
help me with this.

I connected the OH and WI State President in HRC clutches Thursday.  I
followed up with a call to each today and spoke to WI.  She had a pretty
good experience but the clutch was cramped (15 mins for 40 people).  But
she was there and had good feedback.

I'm also in touch with the IL President and she will attend a WJC reception
in Chicago for HRC on Sept. 17 as our guest.  She is privately a HRC
supporter.

Next steps:
-Top priority calls next week PA, NJ and CA.  How are these best done next
week with senior staff?  I have bios and phone numbers pulled.
-There are fundraisers this month in NJ and many in CA that a State
President could attend.  I've spoken with Dennis and he's ready to comp
them.  This can be a invitation on those calls.
-there are about 10 other calls I'd like to get done next week too to other
Presidents.  I'll break those up and send around this weekend.  Appreciate
the team for these calls!

I'll circle back this weekend with call information.

Thanks.  Please let me know if it would be helpful for me to go meet with
California affiliates or get on the phone with any others.  Happy to talk
with as many people as you assign me.  This is really important.
