My sense is that we should put Susan, Karin and Tom in a room and have them
work it out.  They all understand the parameters of what we need and I think
they could craft a proposal that could get us over the hump.  I think Tom
will have the support that we all think he needs with John, Paul and Susan
(among others) working with him.

Of course, anything they work out would be subject to our agreement.
