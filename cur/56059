THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY: HILLARY CLINTON /TPP/ THE CHINESSE ECONOMY
The 2016 Presidential primaries are in full bloom with critical early decis=
ions on labor issues affecting the support of an important democratic votin=
g base.
The state of the U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT  numbers still stands around 95,000,000 =
plus . The rise of the American middle class is where the 2016 General elec=
tion will be decided. What are the candidates visions for wage parity thru =
meaningful jobs?
How do you achieve and sustain  4 % GDP Economic Growth  with a fragile wor=
ld economic stage and increase wages which have been stifled since  mid-200=
0 ? Minimum wage increases  are  not  middle-class  growth  but it does hel=
p the lower end  workers.
Infrastructure investment and the rebuilding of American ,roads, bridges, p=
ower plants, and water reservoirs ARE middle-class wage strengths. Our AFL-=
CIO building trades, carpenters, plumbers , pipefitters, street and road op=
erating engineers etc. want to go back to work as they are the best in the =
world at want they do. The projects and money are sitting there, ready for =
consumption , as our infrastructure is begging for the upgrades. TIME  FOR =
ACTION IS NOW.

THE TPP offers a set of different but complex problems. As we all know , th=
e world economy  is now global . The recent debacle in Greece could very we=
ll breakup the euro if the Greek Government`s proposals for an economic rem=
edy  are not accepted over the weekend by the European Union. Greece reject=
ed the recent terms of a Euro bail-out. Worse is the growing over -producti=
on in China is drastically  reducing their stock market investments similar=
 to the pre-1929 U.S. Market Crash. World demand is not meeting the overabu=
ndance of Chinese supply. China is now relying on internal consumption as m=
eans to distribute their  vast over production. Their real estate is sittin=
g empty and lending policies have their banks on the brink. Their desperati=
on  for the TPP AGREEMENT WITH THEIR FELLOW ASIAN COUNTRIES AND MOST IMPORT=
ANTLY ,THE U.S. COMSUMER MARKETS , IS CHINA`S UPMOST PRIORITY. There in lay=
s the dilemma with the TPP AGREEMENT .What is in it to protect fair pricing=
 and the wages of American middle-class union worker ? Donald Trump has rec=
ently seized on China`s currency manipulation and use of Vietnamese slave w=
ages thus undermining any chance of a more competitive free enterprise /hig=
her quality market place within the TPP.
We need protections within any free trade agreement and it must be public a=
nd while we are at, it is time to invest in the infrastructure here at home=
 which not only grows the middle-class but God only knows how much we need =
an overhaul of our vital living assets.=20
Think about it. Of all the candidates from either party, who best understan=
ds the complexities of the world stage . Who carries the most international=
 respect? Hillary gets it.
