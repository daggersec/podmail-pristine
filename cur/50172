Sen. Frist also says that the socialized medicine charge is being lobbed by=
 "a lot of people on the extreme..."

Bill Frist: 'What The Obama Administration Is Doing Is Not Socialized Medic=
ine'<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/10/15/bill-frist-what-the-obama=
-administration-is-doing-is-not-socialized-medicine/>

[Thursday] morning, former Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) - who spent a =
year working as a doctor for the British national health service - argued t=
hat President Obama's health care reform "is not socialized medicine" and p=
redicted that Congress would pass a health care reform bill by December:

So first of all, what the Obama administration is doing is not socialized m=
edicine. You hear a lot of people on the extreme say that socialized medici=
ne is going to come in and control everything. Socialized medicine is where=
 the government owns the hospitals. They own the doctors and they decide ho=
w much people are getting paid. And that's not what's in these bills.

Watch it:

These "people on the extreme" are members of Frist's own party. In July, Mi=
chael Steele, the chairman of the Republican Party, called Obama's health p=
lan "socialism."<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/07/20/steele-confused-health=
-care/>After the HELP committee passed its health bill, Rep. Louie Gohmert =
(R-TX) predicted that "one in five people have to die because they went to =
socialized medicine!<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/07/16/right-wing-dies-he=
alth-care/>." Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) called the public option "socialize=
d medicine<http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2009/08/17/rep_pete_sessi=
ons_on_socialized_medicine.html>" and Rep. Pete King (R-NY) described Obama=
's campaign health care plans "socialized medicine<http://www.votesmart.org=
/speech_detail.php?sc_id=3D479825&keyword=3D&phrase=3D&contain=3D>."

Frist has recently characterized Republicans as "party of no<http://thinkpr=
ogress.org/2009/10/02/frist-health-vote/>," endorsed the individual mandate=
<http://www.usnews.com/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2009/09/25/frist-endorses-i=
ndividual-mandate-in-healthcare-reform.html>, and the Senate Finance Commit=
tee's approach to health care reform<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/10/02/fr=
ist-health-vote>. During the CSPAN interview, he even praised certain aspec=
ts of the British health care system. "There are some great things about th=
e system as well," he explained. "The primary care, basic care, those physi=
cians get paid more than primary care physicians here...I think from preven=
tive care is probably better there as well."

Frist encouraged Congress to invest more dollars in prevention and change t=
he way the government pays for health care services. "If you reimburse not =
on volume, not on quantity, not on more stuff, but on outcomes, on performa=
nce, on value to the patient, what works...if you're really going to get co=
st effective health care... you have to come with a value based, and not a =
volume based system."
