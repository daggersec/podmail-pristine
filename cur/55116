John --

This just actually happened: =20

The House of Representatives passed one of the most unbelievable,=20
unconstitutional attacks on women's health in a long time.=20

It's a bill written by Republican Arizona Congressman Trent Franks,=20
which would ban abortions after 20 weeks, except in extremely=20
limited circumstances -- a direct legislative challenge to Roe v. Wade.

And 228 members of Congress just voted for it.=20

Maybe they weren't paying attention to the reaction of Americans=20
across the country  last year who rejected candidates who wanted=20
to restrict a woman's access to safe, affordable health care.

That's a message they need to hear loud and clear right now -- if you=20
think politicians have no right to get between a woman and her health=20
decisions, add your name and say you won't stand for it:

http://my.barackobama.com/Stand-Up-For-Womens-Health=20

This bill made it out of the House Judiciary Committee thanks to the=20
votes of 23 Republicans -- all men, of course.=20

And Rep. Franks objected when opponents tried to raise the issue of=20
rape, saying, "...you know, the incidence of rape resulting in=20
pregnancy are very low."

Women made their voices very clear last year when it came to the=20
extreme positions that some elected officials took on women's health.=20
But that hasn't stopped conservative politicians from trying to repeal=20
Obamacare, block the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act,=20
and push an agenda that uses terminology like "legitimate rape."

Making progress on smart health policy isn't easy, but when=20
Congress is spending its time actively trying to chip away at a=20
woman's rights, it feels impossible.=20

We can't just sit back and hope it goes away -- we need to=20
speak up.=20

OFA supporters are going to be on the front lines reminding=20
Congress we're here and we care about women's health.=20

Join the fight today:
