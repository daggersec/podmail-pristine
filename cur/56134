Dear John,=20

A trailblazing former police chief. A decorated war hero. A lifetime educat=
or and community leader aiming to become the first woman to represent Iowa =
in Congress.  These three terrific women House candidates are all giving ri=
ght-wing GOP incumbents a run for their money =E2=80=93 and they're all cou=
nting on you to help them meet critical July fundraising goals.=20

We have just seven days to help Val Demings, Tammy Duckworth and Christie V=
ilsack hit the July 31 goals that will allow them to ramp up their media an=
d field strategies =E2=80=93 and help Democrats recapture the House. Pollin=
g shows these races among the country's tightest =E2=80=93 so we don't have=
 a minute to waste. Please give what you can right now.

Contribute right now to help Val, Tammy and Christie =E2=80=93 your donatio=
n will go directly to these candidates' campaigns. https://secure.actblue.c=
om/contribute/page/july2012goal =20

=C2=B7    As Orlando's Police Chief, Val Demings dramatically lowered crime=
 rates, boosted domestic violence arrests and improved child safety =E2=80=
=93 but right-wing groups are already jumping in to attack Val and prop up =
lackluster Tea Party Rep. Daniel Webster.=20

=C2=B7    Decorated Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth has spent nearly a dec=
ade fighting to improve the lives of America's veterans =E2=80=93 but her s=
elf-proclaimed "crazy Tea Party freshman" opponent, Rep. Joe Walsh, recentl=
y belittled her service and sacrifice. When pressed, Walsh doubled down =E2=
=80=93 so we need to redouble our own efforts to send him packing.=20

=C2=B7    And teacher, literacy activist and former Iowa First Lady Christi=
e Vilsack is poised to make history as the first woman to serve the Hawkeye=
 State in Congress. Thanks to redistricting, her race against Michele Bachm=
ann ally Rep. Steve King, who called Sen. Joe McCarthy a "hero," is one of =
2012's most competitive.=20

Val, Tammy and Christie represent what it really means to get Off the Sidel=
ines. They're working hard, running strong, and giving Democrats a fighting=
 chance at taking back the House -- but they can't miss a single deadline. =
Can you lend a hand today? It would mean a lot to me personally. This is an=
 amazing opportunity to add three strong, independent women to Congress.=20
