John:
A remarkable, bright, funny and talented guy, Dom Lowell, who became a
beloved DA staffer in charge of research and outreach has his heart set on
working for Hillary.  He has had several meetings with Amanda Renteria and
is hoping to be selected as LGBTQ outreach Director.  He would be great and
could build strong bonds for Hillary.

If you or Amanda want/need a conversation to discuss particulars about Dom,
I am available at 202-256-4603.

I hope and trust you are thriving, John.  Please let me know if I can help
you in any way.

Warm regards,
Rob
