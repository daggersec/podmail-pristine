Hello dear Herb!

Thank you so much for your note.  I'm very happy that we are in email touch=
.

I've been thinking of you and now what is our "shared" experience.  Nothing=
, but nothing could have prepared me.  I just cannot wrap my head around ho=
w FAST without a minute of warning that I lost Peter.  Exactly the way he a=
lways hoped that it would be,  but stunningly sad and sorrow filled for me =
and the family.  Almost two months now and it's a struggle. For so many rea=
sons,  and on so many levels and dimensions.  I know you understand.

Peter thought the world of you and Marion and we both enjoyed the time we s=
pent with you.  In fact,  you have been on his mind and on his short list o=
f people he most wanted to see.  We were planning to get thru his 80th BD c=
elebrations and then to connect with the people that we cared about the mos=
t.  You were at the top of the list.  I'm so sorry that we did not.  The ti=
ming of this just has me stunned and deeply saddened.  He was doing so well=
 and was SO happy.  That is truly a blessing.  Not a minute of suffering.  =
I was with him.

I have relocated back to Cleveland, where my frail and ailing Mother is jus=
t hanging on.  I cannot believe that I lost Peter before we lost Mom.  Agai=
n,  very difficult to wrap my head around.

My plan is to spend a good bit of time in NYC.  I would love to see you for=
 a hug and a hello if you have any plans to be in NYC and have the time,  p=
lease do let me know.

Thank you again for your kind words and for being in touch.

Hugs
Janet

Janet
 As you can see, Susan shared your email with me. I trust Jenny shared my e=
mail to her when I learned of Peter's sudden death. I did not have the emai=
l addresses for you and Peter's children and. I wanted to convey my condole=
nces at the earliest moment.
I don't remember what I said, but you should know that Peter had called to =
tell me that you were getting married and that he should have done it earli=
er. He was so pleased.
We both know how special Peter was.
I know how difficult these days must be for you. Please don't hesitate to c=
ontact me if I can be of any help.
Sadly
Herb

Thank you dear Susan for your thoughtful and heartfelt note.

It's only been 7 weeks today since Peter's funeral and I constantly struggl=
e to wrap my head around how FAST he left us,  not one second of warning.  =
A blessing for him,  and stunningly sad for me.  I am trying to stay ground=
ed in his strength and love.  Some days are a little lighter than others an=
d other days it is almost impossible to exhale.  I know you understand grie=
ving and loss.  It's tough for me to navigate my world without Peter.  But =
I am trying to make him proud of me.

Please give my best to your Dad and thank you so much for taking the time t=
o write.  Peter was always very impressed with you and held you in the high=
est regard.  I hope that our paths cross again someday, somewhere.

Take good care of yourself.

Hugs & Love,
Janet
