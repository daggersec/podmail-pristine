I think John welcomes and should say how excited we were and give randi a
chance to say a few words.  But it should feel informal and just an in the
moment kind of thing. Randi hands it back to john who introduces HRC.

We will really upset folks if this feels contrived as part of a big plan
that is taking on trumka.
