Congratulations on a strong performance on Tuesday. I wanted to wait until
Missouri was hopefully called for you but seems like unfortunately that
might be a while.

Today was an epic day at the White House with the announcement of Chief
Judge Garland as our nominee, looking forward to the battle ahead to get
him confirmed.

Just wanted to say if there is anything I can do on my end to move the ball
forward in terms of campaign jobs for after graduation let me know. As I've
said I'd love to do anything on the legal, policy or comms teams. The only
deadline I am up against is signing up for the bar by April if a campaign
gig doesn't work out.

Hopefully talk soon,
Antoinette
