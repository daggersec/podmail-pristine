John,

I realize you have 1,001 more important problems, but do you suppose I could
get five minutes of career advice from you?  If so I would really appreciate
it.

Not sure if you get Thanksgiving this year -- unfortunately I am out of town
from mid-day Friday until mid-day Sunday but any other time would be great.

thanks!
