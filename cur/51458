Steele Dismisses Woman Whose Mother Died Of Cancer: 'It Makes For Great TV.=
 You'll Probably Make It. ... Enjoy.'<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/09/02/s=
teele-howard/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2009/09/02/steele-howard/

RNC Chairman Michael Steele has strongly condemned Democrats who have criti=
cized the town hall protests by opponents of health care reform. Last month=
, Steele said<http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/08/05/rnc-chairman-michael-=
steele-gop-not-behind-town-hall-protests/>:

We are not inciting anyone to go out and destroy anything. We're not organi=
zing the town halls; their senators are. But instead of focusing on the fac=
t that people are genuinely concerned about what is going on, this administ=
ration has the arrogance, the arrogance to look down at my mother, to look =
down at my co-worker.

Yesterday at Howard University, Steele encountered his own "genuinely conce=
rned" citizen - 23-year-old college grad/activist Amanda Duzak<http://washi=
ngtonindependent.com/57446/michael-steele-deals-with-a-town-hall-protester>=
. Duzak stood up and interrupted Steele, arguing that "everyone in this cou=
ntry should have access to good health care<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/d=
ave-zirin/michael-steele-meet-amand_b_274697.html>" and cited the case of h=
er own mother who died of cancer six months ago because she couldn't afford=
 her prescription chemotherapy medications. The audience applauded her.

Steele responded by chastising Duzak and accusing her of pulling antics to =
get on TV. "So people go out to town halls, they go to the community, and t=
hey're like this. (SHAKES ARMS) It makes for great TV. You'll probably make=
 it tonight. Enjoy it." The audience immediately went "Ohhh" and "Oooo." Wa=
tch it:

On the Huffington Post, Dave Zirin also notes that Steele's "effort to conn=
ect with young black students got off to a rather cringe-worthy start when =
right before the billed 'student dialogue' two dozen white members of area =
young Republicans<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-zirin/michael-steele-m=
eet-amand_b_274697.html> arrived to sit in the reserved first two rows of t=
he packed room."
