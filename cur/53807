Hi,

eir history -- from his two brothers to his 97-year-old mother, Eileen=2E

If you want to know the real Pat Quinn, you have to know the full story=
=2E Watch:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/the-real-pat-quinn

This isn't just the story of the Governor's accomplishments -- it's a l=
ook at where he came from and what made him who he is today=2E

But most importantly, this is a story about service to others=2E

I'm grateful that the Quinn family welcomed me into their homes and sha=
red some of their incredible family heirlooms with our team=2E

The Quinn family has been serving their communities for generations, an=
d Pat Quinn has been fighting for families in Illinois for more than 40=
 years=2E

The choice in this election couldn't be clearer=2E
