Hi John,

Congrats on all the great progress you and the Obama team are making -- what an amazing time!  

I wanted to let you know that I spoke with David Hayes and have gotten involved with being a policy advisor with the DOI transition team.   As you know, this work will not take me away from my responsibilities with CAP, but I wanted to make sure I let you know that I was getting involved in this effort.  Additionally, in conversations with both Carol and David, I've been encouraged to throw my hat in the ring for potential opportunities for science advisor type positions with the Obama Administration, and I have done so.  

I hope I will run into you at some point soon as part of my efforts with the DOI team,

My best,
Kit
