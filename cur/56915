Friend,

Three local TV stations are giving Citizens United
the equivalent of a whole lot of free advertising.

Citizens United, the infamous right-wing organization that
ushered in the SuperPAC era of American politics, just released=20
a 30 minute long "documentary" about Terry McAuliffe.

Like other "documentaries" they've produced in the past --
including the anti-Obama The Hope and The Change -- their new
film about Terry is nothing more than a thinly-veiled attack
ad designed to con viewers into believing it's presenting an
objective story.

But these three television stations don't care -- they're
planning to air the documentary 20 times each between now
and the election.

If you don't think it's fair for TV stations to air
a politically motivated and manipulative "documentary," let them
know by signing our petition demanding that they pull it from
their line-up:

http://action.terrymcauliffe.com/stop-the-attack-ads

Reviews for the last film produced by Citizens United were
pretty clear about its accuracy.

It was "highly misleading," and had "a real lack of facts."
One review said "interviews of ordinary citizens appear to
have been conducted under misleading pretenses and have been
selectively edited to leave a false impression." Overall, it
was "ignorant and dumb."

The new "documentary" about Terry will do nothing to educate
voters about the real contrast between the candidates.
Instead, it'll mislead them by presenting skewed opinions as
fact.

Tell the television stations to pull the film from their
schedule -- running it is little more than providing free
advertising for the Cuccinelli campaign:

Thanks for fighting back against this highly coordinated
smear campaign,
