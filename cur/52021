John --=20

Put the list of errands aside. Rake the leaves later.

We've got some calls to make.

There are only three days left until Election Day. And in those three days =
-- right now -- we can help make a big difference in some of the closest =
races across the country.

We're starting the most ambitious get-out-the-vote push ever tried in an =
election like this -- and to reach our goal, we need 234 callers in =
Washington to start calling right now.

Will you make 20 calls today?

http://my.barackobama.com/3DaystoCall1

We can put off a lot of things in our day-to-day lives -- from going to =
the supermarket to picking up dry-cleaning -- but this isn't one of those =
things.

Because once the outcomes that will be decided on November 2nd are set, =
they're set for two years -- and maybe longer.

Right now, it's clear that dozens of races all around the country will =
come down to the wire. And these calls could make the difference between =
winning and losing.

When the polls close on the evening of November 2nd, we all should be able =
to sit back and say that we did everything we could to make sure as many =
folks as possible got out to vote.

Be one of the 234 callers in Washington to help hit our goal.
