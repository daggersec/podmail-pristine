Thanks John.  The next time your out this way let me know.  My buddy Zach Is=
col did an event last weekend at his place for Secretary Clinton and I flew o=
ut--it was great. =20

Also on Rubio if someone could get those talking points to Trump he would li=
kely use them very effectively against Rubio and get a lot of attention as w=
ell.
