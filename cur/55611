Here's a very rough preliminary list - we could send this to WJC to elicit =
a first reaction on the level/kinds of people he'd like, unless you think w=
e need to send a "final" list of recommendations. I'd welcome your feedback=
. Thanks, Ami

David Crane (WJC mentioned him last night)

A bank CEO (for financing expertise/support) - Chad Holiday? (Note that Hol=
iday is UNSG's head of Energy Access for All effort)

CEO of IKEA or Wal-Mart or a large multinational / public-facing corporatio=
n

Helen Clark, UNDP (Europe/Gov/Funder/FEMALE)

Gro Harlem Brundtland (Europe/Gov/FEMALE)

Jose Maria Figueres (LatAm/Male) - also runs Carbon War Room

Felipe Calderon (LatAm/Male/soon-to-be former HoS/good on forestry, etc)

Lula (could help to have a Brazilian; he also would prioritize human impact=
s and real people)

Kevin Rudd (former Gov/Male) - smart on climate policy, knows Asia well

Kofi Annan (Africa, good on agriculture which is important component of cli=
mate efforts)

A leader from China

A former US Mayor or Governor or elected - Bob Gates, Dick Lugar, etc - Goo=
d to have a Republican

A university president

Judy Rodin

Another Foundation/philanthropist

Rick Fedrizzi for buildings

Lester brown or Amory lovins or Francis Beinecke

Peter Seligmann, who runs Conservation International

RK Pachauri (important to have South Asia represented given their contribut=
ions to change

Hal Harvey (not sure if a perfect fit but is a policy guy who's also pragma=
tic - and is plugged into funders, albeit not one himself anymore)

John,

You know this area much better than I do.  It would be helpful if you could=
 review the list Ami has put together and add or delete names before we sen=
d it to President Clinton.
