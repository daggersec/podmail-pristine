It appears that too many people are unavailable at 5:30pm to make today's c=
all worthwhile. We obviously will not be able to do it next week because of=
 the convention, so we'll pick this up again the week of Labor Day. We'll s=
end around a proposed time for that week since Monday is out, and then we'l=
l resume this call every Monday at 5:30pm ET until the election. Thank you =
all!

Best,

Mike
