Hi John,

This just note is a quick note to your personal email, to give you the =
latest update on the Clinton Climate Initiative CEO search. =20

No doubt you already know that in the end, Eric decided to go in another =
direction with a different candidate. =20

It sounds like they found someone who is a very good fit, so I am =
pleased for CCI.

I was deeply gratified to have been a finalist for the position, and to =
have received serious consideration.

Thanks so much for your support and interest, and I will of course =
remain engaged in supporting how I can on strategy. =20

Best,
Bracken
