Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: 'I am running for president'

MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) =E2=80=94 Promising to fight what he deems "obscene le=
vels" of
income disparity and a campaign finance system that is a "real disgrace,"
independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday he will run for
president as a Democrat.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Sanders confirmed his plans to
formally join the race Thursday.

The self-described "democratic socialist" enters the race as a robust
liberal alternative to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and he pledged to do more
than simply raise progressive issues or nudge the former secretary of state
to the left in a campaign in which she is heavily favored.

"People should not underestimate me," Sanders said. "I've run outside of
the two-party system, defeating Democrats and Republicans, taking on
big-money candidates and, you know, I think the message that has resonated
in Vermont is a message that can resonate all over this country."

As he has for months in prospective campaign stops in the early voting
states, and throughout his political career, the former mayor of
Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday assailed an economic system that he said
has devolved over the past 40 years and eradicated the nation's middle
class.

"What we have seen is that while the average person is working longer hours
for lower wages, we have seen a huge increase in income and wealth
inequality, which is now reaching obscene levels," Sanders told the AP.

"This is a rigged economy, which works for the rich and the powerful, and
is not working for ordinary Americans. ... You know, this country just does
not belong to a handful of billionaires."

The son of an immigrant from Poland who sold paint for a living in
Brooklyn, Sanders has for decades championed working-class Americans. He
lost several statewide races in the 1970s before he was elected mayor of
Burlington in 1981, and went on to represent Vermont in the U.S. House for
16 years before his election to the Senate in 2006.

An independent in the Senate, he caucuses with Democrats in Washington and
he is likely to attract some interest from voters who have unsuccessfully
sought to draft Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join the race.

But Sanders rejected the idea his appeal is limited to voters on the left,
boldly predicting Wednesday that his message would appeal to both fellow
independents and Republicans.

Sanders said he would release "very specific proposals" to raise taxes on
wealthy Americans and corporations, as well as offer tuition-free education
at all public colleges and universities. He touched on his past opposition
to free-trade agreements, his support for heavier regulations of Wall
Street and the nation's banking industry, and his vote against the Keystone
XL oil pipeline as a preview of his campaign.

"So to me, the question is whose views come closer to representing the vast
majority of working people in this country," Sanders said. "And you know
what? I think my views do."

The 73-year-old Sanders starts his campaign as an undisputed underdog
against Clinton. Sanders said he has known the former first lady, senator
from New York and secretary of state for more than two decades. "I respect
her and like her," he said.

He noted he has "never run a negative ad in my life," but still drew a
distinction with Clinton in the interview, promising to talk "very strongly
about the need not to get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.=
"

"I voted against the war in Iraq," he said. "Secretary Clinton voted for it
when she was in the Senate."

Clinton is hosting a series of fundraisers this week, starting what could
be an effort that raises more than $1 billion. Sanders said he will make
money and politics a central theme of his campaign, including a call for a
constitutional amendment to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens
United decision, which he blames for unleashing a torrent of money from
wealthy donors into politics.

"What you're looking at here is a real disgrace," he said. "It is an
undermining of American democracy.

"But can we raise the hundreds of millions of dollars that we need,
primarily through small campaign contributions to run a strong campaign?
And I have concluded that I think there is a real chance that we can do
that."

Sanders is the first major challenger to enter the race against Clinton,
who earlier this month became the first Democrat to formally declare her
intention to run for president. He is likely to be joined in the coming
months by former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim
Webb and ex-Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee.
