on initiatives.  Below are some recent updates and press highlights.

Too Small to Fail<http://toosmall.org/>


=B7         Secretary Clinton spoke about Too Small to Fail during her keyn=
ote at the 25th anniversary of HIPPY USA (Home Instruction for Parents of P=
reschool Youngsters), a program she brought to Arkansas as Frist Lady to he=
lp prepare children for long-term success by empowering parents as their fi=
rst and most important teachers. The Daily Beast<http://www.thedailybeast.c=
om/articles/2014/04/25/how-a-kids-program-hillary-brought-to-arkansas-could=
-unite-democrats.html> highlighted the work of Too Small to Fail and Secret=
ary Clinton's decades-long commitment to this important issue.  You can rea=
d it HERE<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/25/how-a-kids-progr=

nt in the Too Small to Fail city campaign which will launch in Oakland and =
San Jose later this summer.



=B7         The Too Small to Fail/Univision partnership continues in full s=
wing.  In addition to airing ongoing programming, Univision is hosting comm=
unity events across the country engaging parents and caregivers to help clo=
se the "word gap."  Too Small to Fail Leadership Council member Cindy McCai=
n joined one of those events in Phoenix; you can read the op-ed she wrote i=
n the Miami Herald about her work with Too Small to Fail HERE<http://www.mi=

Youth Unemployment

=B7         Leading up to next month's CGI-America conference in Denver whe=
re Secretary Clinton will focus on youth employment, our office hosted a me=
eting with Denver-area small businesses to discuss how they can play a role=
 in helping disconnected youth get meaningful hiring, training and mentorin=
g opportunities.  This is part of our larger effort to develop CGI America =
commitments-to-action to support greater economic opportunities for young p=
eople across the country.


Coming up this week:

=B7         Tomorrow, the Secretary will speak at the World Bank with Presi=
dent Jim Kim and UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka to anno=
unce the release of a World Bank Report, entitled "Voice and Agency: Empowe=
ring Women and Girls for Shared Prosperity." Data from this new report will=
 be incorporated into the No Ceilings Progress Report.



=B7         On Friday, she will speak at the New America Foundation Confere=
nce where you can expect to hear more from her on her Foundation initiative=
s.


As always, all feedback, ideas, or other thoughts are most welcome.

Too Small to Fail
How a Kids Program Hillary Brought to Arkansas Could Unite Democrats (Daily=
 Beast)
By Eleanor Clift
April 25, 2014
Daily Beast

If she runs in 2016, her prescient advocacy for early childhood education m=
ight be peaking at just the right time.

Everything Hillary Clinton does is scrutinized for political meaning, and w=
hile no one knows for sure what her plans are for 2016, she's working to ad=
vance issues she has cared about since she was a law student volunteering a=
t the Yale Child Study Center. That was in the '70s, and four decades later=
, early childhood education is receiving the political attention it deserve=
s, with Democrats touting universal free preschool as a centerpiece of the =
progressive agenda.

Clinton's activism in this area may help her marginally with the party's re=
stless left wing, which has grown weary of centrists-a label that for Clint=
on stems more from her views on foreign policy. But there's little daylight=
 between her and Democratic avatars on the left when it comes to issues of =
children and families. "This is what she has been focused on and very effec=
tive in doing for a long time," says Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way,=
 a centrist Democratic group. "She isn't coming late to this party."

On Monday evening, Clinton will give the keynote address at the 25th annive=
rsary of HIPPY, an acronym for Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Yo=
ungsters, a program she helped bring to Arkansas when she was the state's f=
irst lady. The way she became aware of HIPPY is very Hillaryesque. She had =
accompanied then-Gov. Bill Clinton to a National Governors Association meet=
ing in Miami in 1985, and spotted a feature in the Miami Herald with the he=
adline, "Mothers get lessons in teaching."

Those were the days of "Buy one, get one free," the slogan touted by the Cl=
intons as they worked together to push major reforms for a school system co=
nsidered one of the worst in the nation. They were looking for a preschool =
program, and reading the newspaper article, Hillary said years later, "Ther=
e was something about that description which captured me from the very mome=
nt I saw it because what it said was that this was a program aimed at a par=
ent, primarily a mother."

She cut out the article, called the program's originator, a professor at He=
brew University in Jerusalem, Avima Lombard, invited her to Arkansas, and s=
ix months later HIPPY was up and running in Arkansas. It has survived and t=
hrived through ensuing Republican governors because it's not big government=
 going in and telling people how to raise their kids. Program trainers are =
"para-professional paid peers of the parents," says Linda Frank, chairwoman=
 of the HIPPY USA board of trustees. Using a scripted curriculum, they show=
 parents like themselves how to get kids ready for school in math and readi=
ng.

HIPPY now serves 15,000 families in 21 states, and Frank cites "evidence fr=
om various sites around the country that HIPPY children come to school bett=
er prepared and stay ahead." The program began in Israel in 1969 to deal wi=
th an influx of refugees from economically and educationally stressed backg=
rounds. When Clinton was in the White House as first lady, she and Sarah Ne=
tanyahu, wife of the prime minister, toured a HIPPY center in Jerusalem. He=
r instincts vindicated by a growing body of research, Clinton said, "Now we=
 have actual scientific evidence that these kinds of activities with very y=
oung children are not only a nice thing to do, but they literally build bra=
in cells -that by reading to babies, infants, toddlers, young children, you=
 are helping create more connections in the brain."

Building on all that we now know about early education and brain developmen=
t, the Clinton Foundation last year launched Too Small to Fail, a joint pro=
ject with Next Generation, a nonprofit that focuses on climate change and w=
hat its website calls "the threat of diminishing opportunities for children=
 and families." Ann O'Leary with Next Generation worked with Clinton in the=
 White House and in the Senate, and is overseeing the joint initiative. "Wh=
en you say you're partnering with Secretary Clinton, people think she's jus=
t lending her name. It's much, much deeper than that. She helped conceive o=
f the project," says O'Leary.

HIPPY now serves 15,000 families in 21 states, and Frank cites "evidence fr=
om various sites around the country that HIPPY children come to school bett=
er prepared and stay ahead."
With the resources of the Clinton Foundation and the convening power of her=
 name as a potential president, Clinton is getting backing from major playe=
rs to get out the message of more parental engagement. The new initiative i=
s like HIPPY 2.0. The Clinton Foundation chose Tulsa, Oklahoma, for the fir=
st Too Small to Fail project because it was an early adopter of HIPPY. "The=
 secretary asked the owner of QuikTrip what they could do," says O'Leary. W=
ith almost every Tulsan visiting a convenience store in the course of a mon=
th, getting a commitment to put up signs and posters is the kind of local c=
ommunity engagement that is key to succeeding.

In New York, Clinton appeared with the president of Univision in East Harle=
m in February to promote Too Small to Fail; on a recent trip to California,=
 when she approached hospital executives, the head of Kaiser Permanente sai=
d 100,000 babies were born in KP hospitals last year, "and he said there's =
much more we could be doing," says O'Leary. These are valuable political co=
nnections, but Clinton would be doing this networking even if there were no=
 possibility of future elective office.

In the video The Man From Hope that did so much to sell Bill Clinton to the=
 country when it was shown at the 1992 Democratic Convention, footage of Hi=
llary working with HIPPY was left on the cutting-room floor. The program ha=
s grown so much since then, that at the next Democratic Convention, they mi=
ght want to get new footage.

Closing the vocabulary gap one word at a time
By Cindy McCain and Roberto Llamas
May 4, 2014
The Miami Herald

There is tangible evidence of a gap in how children learn before they even =
reach kindergarten. A recent Stanford University study showed that children=
 who are behind their peers in overall language development at 18 months of=
 age will know about half as many words as their counterparts when they rea=
ch the age of 4.

The number of words a child knows by 4 is a strong indicator of how well th=
ey will do later in school. A poor vocabulary at this age translates into p=
oor reading comprehension later on, as well as difficulty understanding new=
 words and communicating with others.

This is because 80 percent of children's brain develops by their third birt=
hday; the early years from birth through 5 are critical to their cognitive,=
 social and emotional growth. Even small investments in time and attention =
during this period can mean the difference between a child who can reach th=
e finish line and one who will never even see it.

But there is good news. Families that simply talk, read or sing to their ba=
bies and toddlers every day will expose them to millions of words by the ti=
me they reach school age. This requires no special training or education - =
just our promise to engage with our children from a very early age.

We see a special opportunity to have an impact with Hispanic families, who =
account for roughly one in four of America's schoolchildren and are expecte=
d to dramatically increase in number in states such as Florida and Arizona.=
 Many of the children affected by the "word gap" are considered dual-langua=
ge learners. That is, they hear a language other than English spoken in the=
ir homes.

In focus groups across America, Hispanic parents have reported concerns abo=
ut talking to their children in Spanish, for fear of causing delays or comp=
lications in early English education. The reality, though, is that talking =
- or reading or singing - to a child in any language - actually builds the =
child's understanding of how language works.

Brain scientists and linguistic experts say learning in one's native langua=
ge provides a strong foundation for learning a second language. We also kno=
w that exposing a child to two languages during these early years can help =
them learn more efficiently as they grow.

So we need to encourage parents to speak to their children in the language =
they feel most comfortable using and to take advantage of every opportunity=
 to impart new words. In time, their children will learn to sort out the di=
fferent words they are hearing inside and outside the home, and they'll rea=
p the benefits of growing up bilingual.

As business leaders and parents, we both understand why it's important for =
all children to have the best possible start in their education and their l=
ives. Today's young children will someday become the workforce, leaders and=
 parents of tomorrow. But without the vocabulary and learning skills to pro=
perly articulate and develop their thoughts, our communities' most vulnerab=
le children will fall behind and never catch up.

That's why we are engaged with Too Small to Fail, a joint initiative of Nex=
t Generation and the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Together=
 we are working in communities across America to reach millions of families=
 with messages about the value of spending quality time communicating with =
their children in their early, formative years.

And we are having an impact. Thanks to a month-long effort in April across =
Univision media, thousands of families have pledged to dedicate time every =
day talking, reading and singing to their children. That translates into mi=
llions of more words our children will hear and learn, better preparing the=
m for their future. Building on this success, we plan to continue engaging =
and educating parents about this critical subject for years to come.

There is no question that parents - regardless of income, race, or educatio=
n level - want what is best for their children. We believe that it's import=
ant for parents and their communities to recognize the power they have to h=
elp their children learn-and collectively, to vastly improve literacy and e=
ducational achievement nationwide.

If we work together in a concerted effort to narrow the word gap by increas=
ing the vocabulary of children before they enter school, we can help provid=
e all of America's children with opportunities to succeed.

Cindy Hensley McCain is chairman of Hensley & Company, wife of Sen. John Mc=
Cain and a member of the Leadership Council of Too Small to Fail. Roberto L=
lamas is executive vice-president and chief human resources and community e=
mpowerment officer at Univision Communications.

No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project
Girls: A No Ceilings Conversation with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea C=
linton
By Suzanne Rust
April 22, 2014
Family Circle Blog

"Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights." It h=
as been almost 20 years since Hillary Rodham Clinton uttered those powerful=
 words at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, but her commitme=
nt to the cause has grown stronger over the decades.

Since leaving her job as secretary of state, Clinton has made women's and g=
irls' issues a central theme of her work. Last Thursday at the Lower East S=
ide Girls Club in New York City, Clinton, along with her daughter, Chelsea,=
 held the first installment of Girls: A No Ceilings Conversation, a series =
of talks that the Clinton Foundation will conduct to get feedback from wome=
n and girls across the country and around the globe. The goal is not only t=
o collect data and celebrate progress, but to address the challenges and ga=
ps that impede progress. Clinton is looking to create a 21st-century agenda=
 for equal opportunity and help ensure the full participation of women in t=
he world.

As the mother of a teenage daughter, I was thrilled to be in that room. Few=
 things make me happier than seeing young women achieve greatness, and few =
things fill me with more rage than the discrimination and injustices that g=
irls encounter around the world. Initiatives like this one, that give girls=
 a voice, are an excellent place to open dialogues, raise awareness and mak=
e changes.

Moderated by actress and advocate America Ferrera, the empowering discussio=
n brought together women of all ages to discuss their experiences and their=
 hopes for the future. Questions came from girls in the room as well as fro=
m four schools in different parts of the country via Skype and thousands of=
 others via Twitter and Livestream. Topics of conversation ranged from the =
lack of women in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics=
) fields and the value of good role models to the importance of asking for =
help and speaking out, our obsession with physical perfection and much more=
.

The event, already energized by major girl power, was further galvanized by=
 the announcement of Chelsea Clinton's pregnancy. As mothers, our greatest =
ambition is for our children's dreams to be limitless. Grab the other women=
 and girls in your life (and the men and boys as well!) and get involved in=
 the conversation. The Clintons want to know what's working and what isn't =
so that we, as women, can gather as a team to make global changes. The Clin=
tons cite the African saying "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want=
 to go far, go together." We can't think of a better mantra.
Hathaway Brown students chat with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, who announce=
d she's pregnant
By Chanda Neely
April 17, 2014
Cleveland Plain Dealer

SHAKER HEIGHTS, Ohio -- Hathaway Brown students Skyped Thursday with former=
 U.S. Secretary of State and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daug=
hter Chelsea Clinton, who announced at the end of the chat that she was pre=
gnant.

Actress America Ferrera moderated the town hall-style, live video chat from=
 New York City. The Clintons appeared on the video chat live from New York =
City. Hathaway Brown was one of four schools in the nation tapped to take p=
art in the conversation about issues facing women and girls.

HB asked the first question of the day, delivered by twin sisters Sunny and=
 Sue Roy, 17-year-old juniors. Both said they were nervous, but excited to =
talk to the Clintons.

"I've seen them both on TV and they're such important driving forces in the=
 pursuit of women's equality everywhere," Sue said. "I'm honored to be able=
 to hold a conversation with them."

"I've never talked to someone quite as important as the Clintons before," S=
unny said.

The Skype chat was the first of many that will be part of The Clinton Found=
ation's No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, which looks at progres=
s women and girls have made in the last 20 years. Each school had a chance =
to ask one question on camera during the conversation that was streamed liv=
e around the world.

The sisters asked the Clintons about the importance of collaborating with o=
ther agencies to achieve equality for women and girls.

Chelsea Clinton responded to the girls' question, saying the Clinton Founda=
tion already is working with the United Nations, World Bank, Google, Facebo=
ok and telecommunications companies around the globe to spread their messag=
e and get feedback.

"It's the only way that we'll have a holistic or at least a holistic attemp=
t at where we stand with rights and opportunities for women and girls aroun=
d the world," Chelsea Clinton said.

Chelsea Clinton, 34, announced she is pregnant during her closing remarks.

"Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later th=
is year, and I certainly feel all the better, whether it's a girl or a boy,=
 that she or he will grow up in a world full of so many strong female leade=
rs," she said, according to published reports.

The Clintons were at the Lower Eastside Girls Club in New York City. The Yo=
rk County School District in Yorktown, Va., Seattle Girls' School in Seattl=
e, Wash., and Kipp Delta School in Helena, Ark., also were part of the vide=
o conference.

"At Hathaway Brown, we spend a lot of time talking about the value of siste=
rhood and collaboration in our own community and across the globe," school =
spokeswoman Kathleen Osborne said. "We are just glad to be a part of such a=
n important conversation."

Hillary Clinton: Nigerian capture an 'act of terror
By Maggie Haberman
May 7, 2014
Politico

Hillary Clinton called the capture of nearly 300 Nigerian school girls by e=
xtremists an "act of terrorism" Wednesday and said the government there nee=
ded to accept global offers of help, including from the United States.

It was the first time Clinton has spoken out at length about the capture of=
 the girls, who were seized from a Nigerian school in mid-April. Initially,=
 more than 300 were kidnapped, but some escaped. At least 276 are reported =
to still be held captive by the Islamist militia Boko Haram, which has thre=
atened to sell them.

Clinton has made the participation of women and girls in society a signatur=
e issue at her family's foundation, but, aside from a tweet on Monday, she =
had not discussed the kidnapped girls publicly until Wednesday. Her comment=
s came after President Barack Obama addressed the matter Tuesday, meaning t=
he potential 2016 presidential candidate couldn't be accused of undermining=
 him.

Asked whether Clinton had intervened with Obama to urge action before his a=
nnouncement on Nigeria, her spokesman, Nick Merrill, replied in an email, "=
We respect her private communications with the [White House], so we defer t=
o them." A White House official, asked the same question, replied that the =
administration's response has "been driven by events, not by any external a=
dvice."

"The seizure of these young women ... is abominable, it's criminal, it's an=
 act of terrorism, and it really merits the fullest response possible first=
 and foremost from the government of Nigeria," the former secretary of stat=
e told journalist Robin Roberts at a Ford Foundation event in New York City=
.

The "government of Nigeria has been somewhat derelict" in dealing with thes=
e types of issues, she said, echoing frustrations voiced by the parents of =
the girls. They "need to make it a priority to do everything they can to tr=
y to bring these girls home safely."

Clinton noted that Obama had offered U.S. military help in tracking down th=
e girls, and that Secretary of State John Kerry, her successor, had "convey=
ed it directly" to Nigerian officials.
The Nigerian government has struggled for years to defeat Boko Haram, a par=
ticularly violent network whose name translates roughly to "Western educati=
on is forbidden." The group's harsh interpretation of Islam frowns upon edu=
cation for girls in particular.

In recent days, outrage over the kidnappings has spread rapidly around the =
world, thanks in part to a social media campaign that uses the hashtag #Bri=
ngBackOurGirls. Clinton's tweet on Monday used that hashtag, as have tweets=
 from first lady Michelle Obama and others. Aside from the U.S., other coun=
tries such as France and China, have offered to help the Nigerian governmen=
t search for the girls.

"It's horrible, Robin, it's horrible," Clinton said Wednesday. "It is a ter=
rible example of what we're seeing unfortunately more of - the use of women=
 and girls particularly as victims of war, as slaves for these militia grou=
ps ... and a failure of local law enforcement, local community support and =
then the entire national government.

Later, at an event hosted by Crisis Group at the Waldorf-Astoria, where Cli=
nton was honored, she said the girls had been taken at "gunpoint by deprave=
d thugs and held in unimaginable conditions. I think about their mothers an=
d their fathers, sick with fear."

She called for "a lot more action" in the "urgent and moral imperative" of =
rescuing the girls.

"I greatly appreciated President Obama's decision to send a team to assist =
the Nigerians. ... Everyone needs to see this for what it is. It is a gross=
 human rights abuse, but it is also part of a continuing structure within N=
igeria and within North Africa."

Clinton also was asked Wednesday if she'd consider tapping either Sen. Eliz=
abeth Warren (D-Mass.) or San Antonio Mayor Juli=E1n Castro as her running =
mate if she were to run for president. She replied that she never answers h=
ypotheticals, but praised the question from the audience as being "one of t=
he cleverest" ways she's been asked about 2016.

"I can only say that they're both extraordinary leaders and great political=
 advocates for a lot of what needs to be done in our country, and I admire =
both of them greatly," Clinton said about Warren and Castro.

Clinton also elaborated in some detail on the frame of her upcoming book, d=
ue out June 10, saying that it begins at the end of her 2008 presidential p=
rimary race against Obama and explores her decision to leave the U.S. Senat=

She talked about "what we found when we got" to Foggy Bottom, and what she =
inherited from the previous administration. She also repeatedly referenced =
the book's title, "Hard Choices," as she talked about ones she'd made while=
 in office.

The former first lady also discussed another title she's soon to take on: g=
randmother, saying she had no preference for whether her daughter, Chelsea,=
 has a boy or a girl.

"I want a healthy, happy child and I have a lot of confidence in my daughte=
r and [her] husband to be the kind of parents" who can help a child flouris=
h, she said. "And I want to do as much as I can - whatever position I'm in =
- to try to keep raising awareness and finding solutions to the problems th=
at stand in the way of a child being able to develop to the fullest of his =
or her potential."
