Subject: Conference call to discuss ProgressNow

Lisa,

Per a conversation with John Podesta, would you please arrange a
conference call between John Podesta, David Brock, Mary Pat Bonner, Kim
Anderson and me to discuss funding for ProgressNow and its affiliates @
5pm EDT tomorrow.

Background=20

John and I talked on Friday about PMUSA and NEA funding for ProgressNow.

Mary Pat and I talked this weekend about other subjects but she
indicated that she was now representing ProgressNow and has some insight
into their funding needs.

John Podesta had suggested we talk @ 5pm tomorrow, so I am setting up a
conference call. I am including Mary Pat. Please let Lisa know if you
can be on?
