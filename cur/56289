Themes for 2016 Emerge as Summer 2014 Winds Down


*TO:                         UndisclosedFROM:                    Isaac
Wright, Director, Correct The Record*

*DATE:                      July 31, 2014*

*SUBJECT:                August Reading - Themes of 2016 Emerging*



Seven central themes
<http://correctrecord.org/memo-themes-for-2016-emerge-as-summer-2014-winds-=
down/>
are
emerging leading up to the 2016 presidential contest and a potential
Hillary Clinton candidacy.



Republican leaders and operatives don't want to run against Hillary Clinton
and have applied a full-court press in an attempt to stop her from entering
the race or, at least, diminish her as a candidate. Right-wing strategists
realize Hillary Clinton is well suited for a 2016 general election and are
spending significant quantities of money, political capital, and time
hoping to undercut Clinton=E2=80=99s momentum, forward-thinking vision and =
record
of accomplishment.



It hasn=E2=80=99t worked.  Public opinion *has* leveled out from record-hig=
h
approval ratings in her tenure as the country=E2=80=99s top diplomat, and k=
ey
indicators suggest the right-wing attack machine is not substantially
changing the dynamic. The American people haven't allowed it. They know
better. They know who is focused on the future. Americans want Hillary to
lead.



Seven key themes integral to a 2016 Clinton candidacy have emerged,
speaking to the substantive strength of a potential Clinton candidacy that
begins in the Democratic primary and ends in the White House.  Clinton=E2=
=80=99s
perception among the Democratic base has evolved into a unique party unity
never before seen by either party.



1.)           Public opinion is much better for Clinton now than it was in
2008.



2.)           Americans across the ideological spectrum, liberals and
moderates in particular, are looking positively to a Hillary Clinton run
for President.



3.)           Voters, specifically Democrats, are eager for her experience.



4.)           Clinton is in step with her party on core issues,
particularly income inequality.



5.)           No credible challenger can amass the kind of broad party
support Clinton has.



6.)           Voters are behind her, not just politicos.



7.)           Hillary Clinton's work ethic has been on display for months.
Clinton and her supporters, if she chooses to run, do not want a coronation
but rather will work hard, seek voters=E2=80=99 support and build a winning
coalition.







Considering these seven themes, one can understand why Republicans are so
nervous about a potential Clinton candidacy, and why the right wing feels
the need to double-down on their failed attacks even now.
1.         Public opinion is much better for Clinton now than in 2008.



=C2=B7      *According to a recent polling analysis by Vox, Hillary Clinton=
=E2=80=99s
poll numbers are much better than at this point in the 2008 cycle.* =E2=80=
=9CBut
back in early 2007, she reached only 30 to 40 percent in polls of
Democratic voters =E2=80=94 indicating that a majority of Democrats weren't=
 yet on
board with a Clinton candidacy. Now, she regularly tops 60 percent in
polls, and sometimes even breaks 70 percent

According

to Clinton and familiar with her thinking insist that she hasn't made a
decision. Perhaps it all comes down, in Clintonian fashion, to definitions.
It depends on the meaning of the word decide. And on the meaning of the
word run. In Hillary Clinton, the United States of America is now
experiencing a rare, if not unprecedented, political phenomenon; she
requires a new lexicon. Clinton is so globally famous, so politically wired

single biggest frontrunner for a Democratic presidential nomination in the
history of the poll, an affirmation of the conventional wisdom that the
nomination is hers for the taking. Clinton stands at an eye-popping 73
percent in a hypothetical 2016 primary race with Biden, the sitting vice
president, who is the only other candidate in double digits at 12 percent.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has signed a letter along with a
handful of other Democratic senators urging Clinton to run, is at 8
percent. And that=E2=80=99s it. That lead is almost three times as large as=
 the one

Republican leaders and operatives don&#39;t want to run against Hillary Cli=
