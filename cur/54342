I made it to Bagram Air Field. Later today I'll travel to Camp Phoenix. As
I've mentioned earlier, I'd thought that I'd only be there for a couple
months before moving. I learned yesterday that the plan is now for me to
only be there for a month and then come back to Bagram. I've decided to
just go with the flow. If you'll pardon my French, it brings to mind one of
my favorite USAF expressions: flexibility is the key to air power--and
getting fucked. I want to be here for 30 consecutive days so as to ensure
that I earn the Afghanistan Campaign Medal. Beyond that, the mission can
send me to the North Pole and I'll manage.
We flew here yesterday in a C-17. We loaded from the tail and took our
seats along the sides of the hold. As we waited to take off, a small bird
flew into the hold and perched above us. Harkening back to my high school
biblical themes in literature class, I decided it was a good omen as a dove
represents the Holy Spirit. So God was with us as we traveled. I got hungry
during the flight and started searching my pack for a Cliff Bar I'd picked
up along the way. I never did find my snack but I did redisocver my XMas
present. So my protective medallions are now safely attached to my keychain
and were with me as we passed into Afghan airspace. Thanks again, Mae and
Megan.
We landed at dusk and by the time we made it out of the terminal the sun
had set. As I looked around Bagram at night my initial thought was that I'd
like to call this place a shithole but that would unfairly malign shit.
There are giant mud pools all over the place where buildings used to stand
that have been torn down as part of the drawdown. The air is
horrible--smoke and dust choke you. The soldiers here run outside but I
can't even imagine. Maybe after some months I will acclimate as they seem
to have. This morning with a little sunlight the country doesn't seem as
bad. Don't get me wrong--Bagram is worse with light. But the snowy
mountains on the horizon are actually somewhat beautiful. I hope Phoenix
will have the views without the military industrial waste.
I'm also floored that Qatar (DQ at the pool) and Bagram (stagnant water
pits) are Air Bases supporting the same campaign. Qatar seems even more
like a ClubMed in retrospect.
I mentioned earlier that I'm travelling with the Deputy Senior Contracting
Officer--Afghanistan. That has made everything go much, much smoother.
Believe it or not, a week of travel between SeaTac and Afghanistan is fast.
She and I ate breakfast this morning and I picked her brain a little on the
contracting process and the role of the legal office. She gave me her
opinion on what makes for a good contracts attorney and, not surprisingly,
the skill set seems remarkably similar to what I've heard makes for a good
Military Justice attorney: give the decisionmaker her legal options and
your own advice, but don't stand in the way when she chooses a perfectly
legal option against your advice. I think this work has the potential to be
really interesting. It sounds like rather than working on contracts for the
retrograde, what I'll be doing is closing out a decade of contracts as the
contracting command rolls out. That is, making final payment and locking up
the file.
I'll hopefully have email access as soon as I arrive in Phoenix but there
is a chance that I will be silent again for a while. In any event, I'll let
you all know as soon as I can that I've arrived safely. As always, love and
miss you all.
PS--my spellcheck seems to be broken on this PC so please excuse any and
all typos.
