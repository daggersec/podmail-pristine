John --=20

This Saturday, Michelle and I are heading out to events as part of
the National Day of Service -- and I hope you'll join us.

It's a day to put politics aside, give back to our communities, and
honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by following his example. If we want
to bring about change, it has to start with us, person by person and
block by block.

To kick off Inauguration Weekend, volunteers have organized a special
service fair right here in D.C. on the National Mall, with guest =
speakers,=20
performers, and nearly 100 service organizations from across the country.

RSVP today, and we'll see you this Saturday in D.C.:

http://action.2013pic.org/Day-of-Service-Fair

I wanted service to be a big part of my inauguration because it's
played a huge role in my life.

As a young community organizer starting out in Chicago, I learned
that the best ideas, the ones that succeed, take hold at the
grassroots. No one needs to wait on politicians or Washington: Change
happens when individuals take responsibility for one another and
their communities.

At the Day of Service in 2009, I visited with military families and
wounded service members at the Walter Reed Medical Center and painted
walls at a homeless shelter. Joe packed his toolbox and helped
Habitat for Humanity hang drywall in new housing in D.C., while my
girls, Michelle, and Dr. Jill Biden filled care packages for our
troops overseas.

Be part of the inauguration by joining your neighbors on Saturday at
the fair on the Mall:

Thanks,

Barack
