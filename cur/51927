He has embraced the compromise, yes. But frankly he is way out of step with=
 average consumers with his love of the QR code and also his faith in the p=
romise of biotech. He has also become persuaded by the big Ag commodity fol=
ks that labeling will lead to food shortages. I can deliver plenty of exper=
ts who can shoot down all of these convictions with hard facts. But to answ=
er you bluntly, this may be a time when the President needs to over rule my=
 friend Tom because of the macro political considerations. Will land in 45 =
mins and can talk if you want and I can also pull in Scott Faber to help cl=
arify which senators. Gh
