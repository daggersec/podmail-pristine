I met with Pete Rouse on Friday when I was in Chicago.  He suggested I
contact you regarding the transition work you're doing for Obama.  I am
forwarding to you the note I sent to Pete.  Please let me know how I can
be of help.

And, thanks for all the support you've been giving Jen through the
Edwards debacle.  They've really been leaning on here to get them
through this.  I know she appreciates the friendship and counsel you've
provided her during this difficult time.  Just wanted you to know that I
appreciate it, too.

Thanks for taking the time to meet on Friday.  Glad to help out on the
campaign in whatever way I can and will continue to work with Heather
when and where she needs.

I appreciate the opportunity to work on the transition and am attaching
my bio and resume as you suggested.  I appreciate your passing this
along to Chris and will contact John Podesta directly.

As I mentioned, I've been working on a transition piece for USDA for a
book that CAP will produce.  However, I probably can be most helpful in
working on the natural resources, energy and environment elements of the
transition given my work with conservation agencies in USDA and DOI.
Having focussed alot with the Clinton administration and since at Yale
on western lands issues like fire, forests, and roadless area
protection, I probably know more about the large landscape issues.
But, wherever I can help...

One final thought.

I mentioned to Heather that I thought a simple and direct way to deal
with the energy issues raised by gas prices (and the critical editorial
in the NY Times yesterday) would be to propose to redirect the tax
credits now going to big oil (aka Exxon-Mobil) and instead give them to
GM, Ford, and Chrysler to accelerate their efforts to develop fuel
efficient cars.  The auto manufacturers need the credits (given big
financial losses) and Exxon doesn't.  But rather than an abstract
redirect of these funds to consumers or to "accelerate development of
cellulosic ethanol", by specifically redirecting the tax credits to the
auto manufacturers, the benefits should be clear -- especially for the
union employees and the states that would benefit like Michigan, Ohio,
and Wisconsin.  Key electoral states, of course.

Thanks again.  I look forward to helping with the campaign and the
transition.
