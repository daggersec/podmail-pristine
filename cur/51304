Subject: RE: Proposal from Chetty

Dear Herb and Steve,

I might as well say at the start that I didn't much like the Chetty proposa=
l. Probably you felt the same way, or you wouldn't have called me. In effec=
t he is asking you for almost half a million dollars in general support for=
 his group to carry on various projects that seem already to have started, =
and are of different interest and value to the general goal. He is requesti=
ng 6 months of salary for three project leaders at $33K per month. It's not=
 clear if Chetty is one of the three (I'm not sure you should ber paying hi=
s salary): if he is not, it's pretty steep, considering that of the other p=
eople only Stantcheva and van Reenen have much standing. On another general=
 point, I'm not sure you want to pay for cleaning European patent data. Thi=
s could be a more complicated job than the proposal lets on, given that dif=
ferent countries may have different rules , and firms can patent in countri=
es other than their home country. Anyway, the proposal uses patent data a l=
ittle uncritically: the literature emphasizes the fact that the decision wh=
ether to patent, and when, is a business strategic decision. Many patents h=
ave little or no true economic value, and some economically important inven=
tions are not patented or are patented only later. So much for generalities=
. Here are a few comments on the individual projects, in case you might be =
interested in supporting some part of the deal.

Project 1. The focus on parents' income seems a little pointless since, as =
the proposal admits, we really care about whether the transmission mechanis=
m is IQ, education, access, ambition or something else. Whichever it is, sm=
all changes inbtax rates are unlikely to have much effect, hardly news. The=
re's not much sign that they have an insight into the sources of innovative=
 activity.

Project 2.  Chetty and Hendren have done some interesting research on geogr=
aphic differences in social mobility. At this stage the important question =
is what is the true source of these differences. It's probably not latitude=
 and longitude per se, but differences in educational quality, peer pressur=
e, non-school activities, etc. Making inferences from the age at which chil=
dren move might get somewhere, but it seems a little indirect. Finding out =
what exactly differentiates high and low mobility cities or neighborhoods c=
ould be important, but this project doesn't focus well on that.

Project 3. There might be something to be learned from this study of supers=
tar inventors. Not sure that focusing on movements from high tax to low tax=
 countries is the key thing. Those movements may be related more to general=
 business decisions: maybe you go to a country where the relevant industry =
is better developed or more progressive, or where there is a compatible res=
earch group or something like that. In any case, do we know that the "home"=
 country of a superstar inventor profits more from his/her inventions than =
other countries, especially if he/she works for a multinational company?

These projects are not without interest, but you don't have to consider the=
 whole bundle. You could ask him to pick out a narrow project and make a pr=
oposal. You could ask Heather which smaller piece fits in best with WCEG pr=
ogram. We could talk about this further by telephone. But you have my first=
 quick take.

Everybody have a nice long weekend.

Bob
