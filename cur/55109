Robert Coombe, Chancellor
Gregg Kvistad, Provost
University of Denver
2199 S. University Blvd.
Denver, CO 80208

Dear Chancellor Coombe and Provost Kvistad:

We, the undersigned, represent more than 200 University of Denver (DU)
students and alumni who demand that you take action in response to the
pay discrimination charge recently filed with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission by Sturm College of Law (Law School) Professor
Lucy Marsh.

As a respected Colorado institution that describes itself as a
"private university dedicated to the public good," we
believe that DU should practice fairness, especially in the treatment
of its own employees. =A0

We want our school and alma mater to stand up for its mission. We are
concerned we are now associated with a University that cannot, or will
not, ensure that its female faculty members receive equal pay for
equal work. We need to know that the principles DU claims to stand for
include fair treatment for all.

Our concerns about wage discrimination at DU are not just about one
professor. The University has the responsibility to ensure that all
faculty members and employees at the Law School are compensated
equitably. In this regard, we are disturbed that even though the Law
School is aware that female law full professors, including Professor
Marsh, are paid less than their male counterparts, it has not
corrected this inequity. =A0And we were especially dismayed to see
that in a December 2012 memorandum on faculty pay, the Law School
admitted that recent faculty raises were implemented "without
regard to trying to correct potential inequities."

This is unacceptable.

We believe DU must take action in response to Professor Marsh's
charge. The University must evaluate its pay practices to identify
gender-based wage disparities system-wide, and eliminate the
institutional barriers and practices that contribute to them wherever
they exist. We ask DU provide a plan for how it intends to respond to
wage discrimination as soon as possible.

It is time for the University to do the right thing for the public
good, and make equal pay a priority.

Sincerely,

Ashley Wheeland and the undersigned University of Denver students and
alumni
