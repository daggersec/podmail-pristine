Dear John

Based on your role in the Law Center at Georgetown University, we think =
you
might be interested in a special educators=E2=80=99 offer on our two
acclaimed PBS documentaries There Once Was an Island and The Insular
Empire: America in the Mariana Islands:
FREE Previews!
20% off individual purchase
30% off purchase of both titles
DVD and streaming available
*Offers good through September 15*

There Once was an Island
Climate change is hotly debated across America even though its impacts
are felt around the world, often by communities with a minuscule
carbon footprint.  Takuu atoll contains a unique Pacific culture and
religion with its own language, all of which will die if the community
moves.  There Once was an Island follows three people on the atoll as
climate change breaks down their traditional way of life and forces
them to consider leaving their home forever.

While economic disruption in developed economies is increasingly part
of climate change=E2=80=99s story, this beautifully-shot film is =
meditation
on what loss of place, identity and culture means on the margins. A
free preview and special educator reductions are available for the
start of the academic year =E2=80=93 please see links below.

The Insular Empire: America in the Mariana Islands
July 21st marked the 70th anniversary of America=E2=80=99s WWII invasion =
of
the Mariana Islands - yet after seven decades the US Territory of Guam
is still on the UN list of "non-self-governing territories.=E2=80=9D This
summer, enjoy discounts and a free preview of the highly acclaimed PBS
documentary The Insular Empire, which chronicles the complex political
history of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands through the personal
stories of four indigenous island leaders. The only film to document
America=E2=80=99s ongoing history as a colonial power in the Pacific, The
Insular Empire is a story of loyalty and betrayal, about a patriotic
island people still struggling to find their place within the American
political family.
