fyi, got an inquiry from Politico reporter (Ben Smith) asking, off the  
record, about your coming to DA as transition rep, but doing  
fundraising for CAP.  we tried to tell him that's ridiculous, but  
we'll see what he does.  he talked to my staffer, Jen Ancona, but let  
me know if you want me to talk to him directly.
