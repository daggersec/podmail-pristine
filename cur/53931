I had a meeting with Tom and Susan today with Mary Pat joining by phone.
John as you predicted having Susan at the meeting was very helpful.

We walked through the fundraising plan, how we plan to work together, the
message/ mobilization split and their participation in the fundraising as
well.  I think the meeting went very well.  They were thrilled we were
moving money to the C4 by years end and they were eager to share this with
Steve. As predicted as well, they thought money from Steve to the 527 could
move in January helping out the effort with these new developments.

Susan is checking with the lawyers first but will meet with Mary Pat to go
over the donor list to determine who Steve knows and who Susan knows and
making suggestions for additions she thinks are possible targets.

We are planning on meeting to go over finance every 2 weeks to reassure
everyone  and make sure we all stay on the same page.

Our accountant has cut the checks for December 2007 and is sending them to
me tommorrow morning and I will sign and distribute.

When the SEIU money moves we will have 7.3 million into the fund by Dec
31st.

I am currently working on the operational budget and to finalize some
adminitrative issues by year end.

John I need to touch base with you on:
        Joe Lockhart
        Rob Stein

Anna- I think I will see you breifly tommorrow.

Thanks everyone- if you have questions please let me know otherwise, have a
great New Years!
