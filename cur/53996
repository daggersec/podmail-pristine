*A New Clue Suggests Biden May Run*

Joe Biden has taken another step toward entering the Presidential race.

Representatives of the Vice-President held a meeting this week with
Democratic National Committee staffers. They briefed Biden=E2=80=99s aides =
on
arcane but crucial rules that the Vice-President would need to understand
if he decides to run, according to a D.N.C. official.

It was the most significant sign the source had seen to indicate Biden=E2=
=80=99s
intentions. =E2=80=9CI think it means he=E2=80=99s running,=E2=80=9D the so=
urce said.

The D.N.C. has held similar meetings for representatives from the five
declared Democratic candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Jim Webb,
Martin O=E2=80=99Malley, and Lincoln Chafee. The D.N.C. offered the meeting=
 to
Biden earlier this year, and the party committee was scheduled to brief his
aides back in June, but that meeting was cancelled.

When the meeting was finally held this week, D.N.C. staffers walked Biden=
=E2=80=99s
representatives through the primary calendar, filing deadlines, the
mechanics of ballot-access issues, and the complicated details of the
party=E2=80=99s state-by-state selection process for delegates and super de=
legates.
The session included a level of detail that would only be of interest to a
candidate who is serious about running. For example, the briefing included
information about issues such as whether a particular primary state
requires a candidate to send a letter to the Secretary of State in order to
get on the ballot, or circulate a petition, or pursue some other method.

But, while the briefing is considered an important step for any candidate
who is serious about entering the race, how it will affect Biden=E2=80=99s =
decision
is unclear. It may simply be that Biden is still gathering the necessary
information to help him make a final determination. And the details of the
complicated process of winning enough delegates to secure his party=E2=80=
=99s
nomination might convince Biden that the window to enter the race has
passed.

The D.N.C. source, who was briefed on the meeting, said that the
information conveyed seemed eye-opening for Biden=E2=80=99s aides. =E2=80=
=9CThey probably
thought they had a lot longer,=E2=80=9D the source said. =E2=80=9CThe deadl=
ines for
qualifying on the ballots for key states haven=E2=80=99t passed yet, but ar=
e fast
approaching.=E2=80=9D

=E2=80=9CD.N.C. staff offers all Democratic Presidential candidates and pot=
ential
candidates briefings on the ballot and delegate process,=E2=80=9D said a D.=
N.C.
spokesperson, declining to confirm or deny whether D.N.C. staff briefed
Biden=E2=80=99s representatives this week.

The rumblings in Democratic circles about whether Biden may be leaning
toward running seem to be impacting the Clinton campaign. Yesterday,
Clinton announced that she no longer supported the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, the trade deal that, in 2012, she said =E2=80=9Csets the gold =
standard
in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of
environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.=E2=80=9D
Additionally, in =E2=80=9CHard Choices,=E2=80=9D Clinton=E2=80=99s 2014 mem=
oir of her tenure as
Secretary of State, she wrote that the T.P.P. would be a =E2=80=9Csignature
economic pillar of our strategy in Asia.=E2=80=9D

The trade deal is vehemently opposed by labor unions, whose support Biden
would count on if he enters the race. As a sitting Vice-President, it would
be far more difficult for Biden to oppose the T.P.P., one of Obama=E2=80=99=
s top
remaining priorities, and on Tuesday, Biden=E2=80=99s spokesperson confirme=
d that
he supports the bill and will help pass it on the Hill.
