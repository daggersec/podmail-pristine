Dear John,

This Tuesday, September 14, is the Democratic Primary for US Senate and I'm asking for your help.

Over the last year and a half, Kirsten has fought each and every day for us.  She's worked to create jobs and get our economy moving.  She's worked to reform Washington, so that our lawmakers are more accountable to us.  And she's been a voice for equal rights and equal opportunity even in the face of extreme opposition.

Over the next three days and in the weeks leading up to November, we need to get out there and fight for her.  It's time to hit the pavement, make the phone calls, get our friends and families to the polls, and even contribute just $25 or $50 to help Kirsten win this.

I hope you'll join us, but before you do, watch this video and remember why we're fighting so hard to elect Kirsten to the US Senate.

*Click here to watch the video.* [ http://secure.democratsenators.org/o/44/t/827/p/wfc/dscc/senators/gillibrand/donate.sjs?donate_page_KEY=8759 ]

Kirsten is absolutely right: this is all about who we fight for and you know Kirsten will take a backseat to no one when it comes to fighting for New York.

*We are facing such big challenges right now -- we need an advocate like Kirsten fighting for us every day in Washington.* It's time to take action.  It's time to elect Kirsten to the US Senate and send a message that she is the one New York wants representing us in Washington.

Click here to pledge your support for Kirsten.

Thanks for everything you're doing to help elect Kirsten to the US Senate!
