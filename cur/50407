John --=20

I wrote you last week after 45 senators sided with the gun lobby=20
and voted against expanding background checks for gun sales.=20

I said we weren't going to forget -- and that we weren't going to=20
stop fighting until we get the job done.=20

I'm writing today to follow through on that.

Next week, we'll deliver an OFA petition to=20
Congress demanding that they take common-
sense action to reduce gun violence.

But it'll only be as powerful as the number of supporters behind it.

Please take a minute and add your name to this petition right now:

http://my.barackobama.com/Sign-the-Petition

In politics, there are two kinds of people: Those who say they're=20
going to do something, and those who actually do it.

I have no doubt about which of those groups OFA supporters are in.

But if we want Congress to get serious about reducing gun violence,=20
and if we don't want to see the fire behind this issue slip away, we=20
are the ones who have to keep it going.

We choose who represents us in Congress -- and what the=20
constituents want is something that no politician can afford to ignore.=20

That's why your voice is such an important part of this fight. People=20
like me can talk all we want, but your representatives want to hear =
from=20
you.

This letter will go to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,=20
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John=20
Boehner, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on behalf of OFA=20
next week.

Make sure your name is on it:=20
