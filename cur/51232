This morning, The Michigan Messenger's Eartha Jane Melzer was the first to
report on Sugar Law Center of Detroit's legal challenge to the Emergency
Manager legislation<http://michiganmessenger.com/50121/lawsuit-seeks-injunc=
tion-on-emergency-manager-law>
:

   - In the lawsuit filed today in Ingham County court, *citizens from
   across the state are asking that Michigan=92s Emergency Manager law be
   declared unconstitutional.*
   - *The law,* officially titled the Local Government and School District
   Fiscal Accountability Act, *allows the governor to appoint Emergency
   Managers to take over local units of government, fire elected officials,
   sell off or privatize community assets and even dissolve whole cities.*
   - =93This is an infringement on basic democracy,=94 said plaintiffs atto=
rney
   John Philo of the Sugar Law Center for Economic & Social Justice. =93It =
really
   is an experiment in a new form of government -- one person rule.=94
   - In the legal arguments presented today, a group of 25 plaintiffs say
   the right of citizens to elect their local officials is guaranteed in th=
e
   state constitution and financial stress is not a legitimate ground for
   scrapping the democratic process.

The Michigan Messenger has led the coverage of the evolution of Emergency
Financial Mangers<http://michiganmessenger.com/47013/bill-offers-no-guideli=
nes-for-use-of-emergency-managers-powers>to
the constitutionally
questionable<http://michiganmessenger.com/46807/constitutionality-of-emerge=
ncy-manager-powers-questioned>Emergency
Managers, as described above, in this year's state legislature.
The Michigan Messenger was also the first outlet to report on how the new
law is affecting Benton Harbor<http://michiganmessenger.com/tag/benton-harb=
or>,
Mich., referred to as "the ground zero of American
politics<http://michiganmessenger.com/48403/maddow-benton-harbor-is-ground-=
zero-of-american-politics>
."

e
Emergency Manager law

current issues surrounding the legislation,

this new law has already been impacting towns and counties in Michigan
