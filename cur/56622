If we need words I would go with " I will work to reduce the size of the
banks in a heartbeat"  or if more is needed to go with "I will work to
reduce the size or even breakup the banks in a heartbeat ..." rather than a
reference to reinstating Glass Steagall.

I say this as we've already said that crisis wasn't about Glass Steagall
restrictions but about risk.  Also I believe that as a policy matter that
the issue about too big or too risky to fail is about size and risk not
Glass Steagall.  I would prefer not to concede that point.

Further, Dodd Frank gave the FDIC and Fed to restructure or even downsize
banks if the living will process leads to a conclusion that the risk of
resolution is too great.
