Hi John-

Just wanted to give you an update here. I spoke yesterday with Brynne and
our NH political director Kari Thurman.  It sounds like they had a few
problems with George in the past which caused him to fail vet. Yet, even
after they determined that they wouldn't be able to bring him on as a
fellow or a Clinton Team Leader they still met with him to try to keep him
involved.

Kari wrote a little note to follow up on our conversation. Erin, mentioned
below, is the Regional Organizing Director.

*"Thanks for taking the time to chat yesterday about this. *

*Unfortunately, Mr. Manos did not pass vet for our fellows program. As a
result, Erin met with him to see about ways that he would still be able to
help the campaign through volunteer activities in his community -- building
up to becoming a Clinton Team Leader. From my past experience here with Mr.
Manos, he has demonstrated some erratic and irregular behavior. The email
sent to Mr. Podesta is similar to emails that he has sent to other
individuals here affiliated with campaigns. We will continue to work with
Mr. Manos to empower him to help our campaign in the best way he can. *

*I am happy to answer any further questions or concerns. Thanks again! "*

Please let me know if you'd like me to follow up with either George or
political.

Thanks,
Milia
