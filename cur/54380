PE:  I just wanted to expel one rumor before I take questions. I did not se=
lect Arne because he is one of the best basketball players I know, but we a=
re putting together the best basketball playing cabinet in American history=
, and that is worth noting. I am going to take a few questions. Let me star=
t with Barbara Pinto at ABC.
BARBARA PINTO, ABC: You had mentioned the ties between education and the ec=
onomy and that is where I'd like to take us. The federal reserve is expecte=
d to lower the fed funds rate today to 50 basis points, lowest rates in his=
tory, and I am wondering how confident are you in Ben Bernanke's decision, =
and with that decision, are we running out of options to jump-start the eco=
nomy?
PE: I don't think it's good policy for the President or President-Elect to =
second guess the Fed, which is an independent body. But let me just make an=
 observation, that we are running out of the traditional ammunition that is=
 used in a recession, which is to lower the interest rates, they're getting=
 to be about as low as they can go. While the fed will have more tools avai=
lable to it, it is critical that the other branches of government step up, =
and that's why the economic recovery plan is so absolutely critical, and my=
 economic team, which I will meet with today, is helping to shape what is g=
oing to be a bold agenda to create 2.5 million new jobs,  to start helping =
states and local governments with shovel-ready projects, and rebuilding our=
 roads, our bridges, and making sure schools like this one that are energy =
efficient, putting people back to work, and getting businesses to start see=
ing some increase in demand so that we can get instead of a downward spiral=
, start getting on an upward spiral. I am confident that we can accomplish =
that if we have republicans and democrats, federal and state governments wo=
rking together. We are going through the toughest time economically since t=
he great depression, and it's going to be tough and we will have to work th=
rough a lot of these difficulties, these structural difficulties that built=
-up over many decades. Some of it having to do with the financial industry,=
 and the huge amounts of leverage, the huge amounts of debt that we're taki=
ng on, the speculation and the risk we were taking on, the lack of financia=
l regulation, and some of it having to do with the housing market, stabiliz=
ing that. It's going to be, I think, critical for us to look at some of the=
 long-term issues that I talked about during the campaign, health care and =
energy. And finally, education is going to play a critical role in this. Wh=
at the fed does or what our administration does in terms of short-term emer=
gency action is obviously going to be important to peoples' everyday lives.=
 But if we pursue the kind of strategy that Duncan pursued, and I want to s=
ee our administration to pursue, that is making no excuses and expecting hi=
gh achievement from every child.  if we can get young people focused on edu=
cation, and if we can change our culture so that we are once again valuing =
in achievement, and if we are willing to all pull together around making ou=
r schools better, that's going to be the single biggest determinant in term=
s of how our economy does long term. John McCormick?
JOHN MCCORMICK, TRIBUNE: Thank you, Mr. President-Elect. Given the situatio=
n here in Illinois, do you favor or oppose the special election to fill you=
r vacant seat? Secondly, you told us at your first press conference that yo=
u were taking a hands-off approach to filling that spot. Over the weekend t=
he tribune reported that your incoming chief of staff presented a list of p=
otential names -
BO:  John let me just cut you off. I don't want you to waste your question.=
 As I indicated yesterday, we have done a full review of this, and the fact=
s are going to be released next week. It would be inappropriate for me to c=
omment because for example the story that you just talked about in your own=
 paper, I have not confirmed that it was accurate and I don't want to get i=
nto the details at this point. So do you have another question?
MCCORMICK: The conflict between what you said your hands-off approach -
PE:  John, John, I said that the U.S. attorney's office specifically asked =
us not to release it until next week.
MCCORMICK: What about the special election?
PE:  I said I don't think the governor can serve electively in his office. =
And I will let the state legislature make a decision on how they want to pr=
oceed.
MCCORMICK: Do you or Duncan have a better jump shot?
PE: Duncan. That's an easy one. Mary Ann Ahearn?
Mary Ann Ahern, NBC Chicago:  there have still been many that people can do=
 better, and you yourself sent your daughters to private schools. What kind=
 of commitment can you make for resources for the public school system? Do =
you agree with Duncan's proposal of cash incentives, giving kids that recei=
ve As and Bs, perhaps $100. And what did the mayor say when you were taking=
 Duncan away from Chicago? I had to get them all in.
PE:  I understand. First of all, I think Arne and Joe and myself all agree =
that the Chicago public schools are not as good as they need to be. And the=
 vast majority of schools that are under performing can do better. That's o=
ur job. To raise expectations for parents, for students, for teachers, for =
principals, for school administrators. That's what Arne has consistently do=
ne. And what I am so impressed with is the dedication that he has shown in =
continuous steady improvement. And that's what we are looking for. Look, we=
 are not going to transform every school overnight. And there is some schoo=
l systems, not just big city school systems, rural schools and suburban sch=
ools that are just not up to snuff. But we can expect is that each and ever=
y day we are thinking of ways to make schools better. That's what Arne has =
done and that will be his task. One of the things that Arne and I share is =
a deep pragmatism in the way we go about this. If pay for performance works=
, and we can work with teachers so they don't feel like it's being imposed =
on them, but instead they have an option for different compensation mechani=
sms in order for us to encourage high performance then that's something we =
should explore if charter schools work let's try that. Let's not be clouded=
 by ideology when it comes to figuring out what helps our kids. And I think=
 Mayor Daley could not be prouder of Arne Duncan and the fact that the same=
 dedication hard work that he has shown here in Chicago he is going to be a=
ble to show to the entire country nation. Carol Lee? Where's Carol? Carol f=
rom Politico. There you are
CAROL LEE, POLITICO: Thank you, Mr. President-elect. You had said before th=
at you were going to appoint a number of republicans to your cabinet, and s=
o far we have not seen that many. What can we expect in that area?
PE: I am not giving you a preview. We have got more appointments to make, a=
nd I think that when you look at our entire white house staff and cabinet a=
nd [no audio], I think that people will feel that we followed through on ou=
r commitment to make sure that this is not only a administration that is di=
verse ethnically, but it's also diverse politically, and it's diverse in te=
rms of peoples' life experience. Arne is somebody who has really been worki=
ng on the ground; he is not a creature of Washington. That's not where he c=
ut his teeth. He cut his teeth working with kids individually, working in s=
chools like this. We have other people obviously who have Washington experi=
ence, and I think that blend is going to make us extraordinarily effective =
on not just our education agenda but our broader agenda to help American fa=
milies live out the American dream. Okay. Thank you, guys.

"Times New Roman","serif"'>PE: I am not giving you a preview. We have got m=
ore
appointments to make, and I think that when you look at our entire white ho=
use
staff and cabinet and [no audio], I think that people will feel that we
followed through on our commitment to make sure that this is not only a
administration that is diverse ethnically, but it's also diverse politicall=
y,
and it's diverse in terms of peoples&#8217; life experience. Arne is somebo=
dy
who has really been working on the ground; he is not a creature of Washingt=
on.
That&#8217;s not where he cut his teeth. He cut his teeth working with kids=
 individually,
working in schools like this. We have other people obviously who have
Washington experience, and I think that blend is going to make us
extraordinarily effective on not just our education agenda but our broader
agenda to help American families live out the American dream. Okay. Thank y=
ou,
guys. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
