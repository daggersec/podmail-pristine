I would like to also circulate the following quotes from McCain for when
inevitably goes after Obama on opting out. In 2004, he praised small
donations similar to Obama's model.  

 

McCain: "We Want Average Citizens To Contribute Small Amounts of Money. I'm
For That.  I Think It's A Great Thing."  During an appearance on On the
Record, McCain said, "I think it's wonderful that Howard Dean was able to
use the Internet, $50, $75, $100 contributions. That's what we want it to be
all about. We want average citizens to contribute small amounts of money,
and that's a commitment to a campaign. So I'm for that. I think it's a great
thing. I think the Internet is going to change American politics for the
better." [Fox News, "On the Record," 1/21/04]

 

McCain: It's "Wonderful" That More People Are Involved in The Political
Process "With Relatively Small Campaign Contributions."  During an
appearance on MSNBC's "Hardball," McCain praised the internet's ability to
raise money in small contributions.  McCain said, "The Internet is
generating more and more people involved in the political process with
relatively small campaign contributions, $50, $75. That's wonderful.  No
longer can an office holder call up a CEO or a trial lawyer or a union
leader and say, I need $1 million. And, by the way, your legislation is up
before my committee again." [MSNBC, "Hardball," 6/29/04]

Speaking of the fundraiser... Also in the Twin Cities, we have an op-ed in
the Star-Tribune hitting McCain on the fundraising issues and his opposition
to public financing... And because of today's announcement:

Excerpt from below: "McCain will try to make political hay if Obama chooses
not to participate in the presidential public financing system in the
general election. But we shouldn't forget that McCain himself has already
opted in, and then opted out, of the presidential system this election
cycle. The only reason he's gone unchecked is the lack of a quorum at the
dormant Federal Election Commission."

Candidates will do most anything for money

By DAVID DONNELLY

June 18, 2008

When Sen. John McCain arrives in Minneapolis for a high-dollar fundraiser
today, he will have already attended at least seven other fundraising events
in five cities this week. This circuit is par for the course for our
presidential candidates, who both are racing around the country as if on a
giant Monopoly board, scooping up checks from whomever will write them.

And that's recently landed McCain in a bit of hot water.

McCain's campaign was forced to postpone another event this week --
scheduled in Midland, Texas -- when women's organizations questioned why he
would hold a fundraiser at the home of oilman Clayton Williams. During his
1990 campaign for governor against the late Ann Richards, Williams equated
rape to bad weather. "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it," he said.
He also promised to treat Richards as if she were a cow, saying he'd "head
her and hoof her and drag her through the dirt."

The McCain campaign feigned ignorance about Williams' past, but that claim
rang hollow. These unconscionable comments are widely known in Texan and
national political circles, and could have been easily found with a quick
Google search. The most charitable read is that the campaign used the old
Sergeant Schultz defense -- "I see nothing!" -- so that they could deny ever
knowing the truth if someone caught them red-handed.

How can the campaign be so oblivious? Perhaps the insatiable drive for cash
is also to blame. McCain has been asked to rid the campaign of the $300,000
that Williams raised, but so far he's refused. Returning the money or
donating it to a charity is the right thing to do in this case. But this
political penance would only wallpaper over the real problem: Regardless of
political party, candidates are required to raise ever-increasing large sums
of money to run for higher office.

Much has been written about McCain's opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, and the
fundraising machine he's built. The explosion of small donations to his
campaign is a hopeful sign of political engagement of millions of Americans,
but it does not, in and of itself, represent an overhaul of the rules for
everyone else. While small online donors fuel Obama's rise, McCain's run has
been increasingly dependent on large contributions to his campaign and even
larger ones to the Republican National Committee. In fact, they've set a
goal of raising $120 million for the party alone. And that's how most
candidates do it.

McCain will try to make political hay if Obama chooses not to participate in
the presidential public financing system in the general election. But we
shouldn't forget that McCain himself has already opted in, and then opted
out, of the presidential system this election cycle. The only reason he's
gone unchecked is the lack of a quorum at the dormant Federal Election
Commission.

Relatively little has been written about what the candidates intend to do
about the cash-and-carry system of paying for campaigns. On the surface, one
would think that the race features two reform candidates. The truth,
however, is more complex. Like his shift to support President George W.
Bush's policies on tax cuts and off-shore oil drilling, McCain's record on
campaign finance reform is decidedly not prologue to what he would support
as president.

McCain once authored a fix to the broken presidential public financing
system but now refuses to add his name as cosponsor to the same bipartisan
legislation. He once called his state's Clean Elections public financing law
a "national model" but now states he opposes its extension to all federal
races.

Obama has cosponsored both and has said that their passage would be a
priority if elected.

McCain's campaign website rightly identifies one aspect of the problem of
money in politics, stating that "the most influential lobbyists with the
greatest access in the nation's Capitol are also the most prolific political
fundraisers," but, according to Public Citizen, McCain has five times the
number of lobbyists as Obama -- 70 to 14 -- raising money for his campaign.

Under comprehensive public financing systems, like those operating
successfully in a number of states around the country, candidates would rely
little if at all on lobbyists and fundraisers like Clayton Williams. Perhaps
that's the ultimate lesson for McCain from the canceled fundraiser in Texas.
Don't just vet the fundraisers. Overhaul the system.

David Donnelly is director of Campaign Money Watch, which describes itself
as a nonpartisan campaign-finance watchdog group based in Washington.

Republican John McCain will bring his presidential campaign to Minnesota for
the first time today, holding an early evening town hall meeting in St. Paul
with a select group of undecided voters after a late afternoon fundraiser in
Minneapolis. 
None of the events is open to the public. 

An earlier public event tentatively planned for Eagan has been canceled, a
campaign aide said. 

Facing a November showdown with Democrat Barack Obama, McCain hopes to push
purple Minnesota into the red column for the first time in 36 years and pick
up some much-needed cash in the process. 

Tickets for his fundraising reception, starting at 5:30 p.m. at the Hilton
Minneapolis, range from $1,000 a person for dinner to a private reception
for individuals and couples who raise $50,000. 

The Arizona senator needs the money. Through April, Obama had raised $265
million to McCain's $97 million. 

The town hall meeting will be at the Landmark Center in downtown St. Paul,
just a block from the Xcel Energy Center where McCain will receive the
Republican presidential nomination in September. 

The event is by ticket only. The campaign did not say how they selected
undecided voters to attend the meeting. 

The crowd will not come close to matching the 30,000 people who swarmed the
"X" on June 3 to hear Obama declare victory in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination. 

McCain's visit suggests he considers Minnesota a battleground state.
Although Democrats have carried it in the past eight elections - their
longest winning streak in any state - the past two presidential contests
have been close. In 2000, Al Gore narrowly defeated George W. Bush, 48
percent to 46 percent, and four years ago, John Kerry topped Bush 51 percent
to 48 percent. 

Polls suggest McCain is within striking distance in Minnesota. The most
recent one showed he and Obama are virtually tied. 

Obama led McCain, 47 percent to 46 percent, in a Survey USA poll released
Monday. That survey, conducted for KSTP-TV and two other Minnesota
television stations, had a 4.3 percentage point margin of error, making the
race a dead heat. 

But the average of the three most recent statewide polls gives Obama a
9-point lead, 50 percent to 41 percent. The Rasmussen Report and the Star
Tribune's Minnesota Poll conducted the other surveys. 

"It is clearly a dead heat," Ben Golnik, McCain's regional campaign manager,
said Wednesday. "We think we've out-organized Obama. Our offices opened
ahead of theirs. We have more staff on the ground, and we feel good about
it." 

In addition, Gov. Tim Pawlenty is McCain's national campaign co-chairman and
is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate. But when asked to
comment on McCain's visit, Pawlenty said ... nothing. He failed to respond
to a Pioneer Press request for an interview on the event. 

He did, however, find time to publicly criticize Obama before the Democratic
candidate held his St. Paul rally. 

But the governor has not had a discernible impact on the presidential race
in Minnesota so far, said Donna Cassutt, associate chair of the state
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. 

"Minnesotans are not buying what John McCain is selling, and Gov. Pawlenty
is not helping him to close the deal," Cassutt said. "As we recall, Gov.
Pawlenty couldn't even carry his own party's caucuses for McCain." 

McCain finished a distant second behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt
Romney in Minnesota's Feb. 5 Republican precinct caucuses. 

But McCain won 35 of the 41 Republican National Convention delegates elected
at GOP conventions around Minnesota this spring.

Candidates will do most anything for money<br>
<br>
By DAVID DONNELLY<br>
<br>
June 18, 2008<br>
<br>
When Sen. John McCain arrives in Minneapolis for a high-dollar fundraiser
today, he will have already attended at least seven other fundraising events=
 in
five cities this week. This circuit is par for the course for our presidenti=
al
candidates, who both are racing around the country as if on a giant Monopoly
board, scooping up checks from whomever will write them.<br>
<br>
And that's recently landed McCain in a bit of hot water.<br>
<br>
McCain's campaign was forced to postpone another event this week -- schedule=
d
in Midland, Texas -- when women's organizations questioned why he would hold=
 a
fundraiser at the home of oilman Clayton Williams. During his 1990 campaign =
for
governor against the late Ann Richards, Williams equated rape to bad weather=
.
&quot;If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it,&quot; he said. He also
promised to treat Richards as if she were a cow, saying he'd &quot;head her =
and
hoof her and drag her through the dirt.&quot;<br>
<br>
The McCain campaign feigned ignorance about Williams' past, but that claim r=
ang
hollow. These unconscionable comments are widely known in Texan and national
political circles, and could have been easily found with a quick Google sear=
ch.
The most charitable read is that the campaign used the old Sergeant Schultz
defense -- &quot;I see nothing!&quot; -- so that they could deny ever knowin=
g
the truth if someone caught them red-handed.<br>
<br>
How can the campaign be so oblivious? Perhaps the insatiable drive for cash =
is
also to blame. McCain has been asked to rid the campaign of the $300,000 tha=
t
Williams raised, but so far he's refused. Returning the money or donating it=
 to
a charity is the right thing to do in this case. But this political penance
would only wallpaper over the real problem: Regardless of political party,
candidates are required to raise ever-increasing large sums of money to run =
for
higher office.<br>
<br>
Much has been written about McCain's opponent, Sen. Barack Obama, and the
fundraising machine he's built. The explosion of small donations to his
campaign is a hopeful sign of political engagement of millions of Americans,
but it does not, in and of itself, represent an overhaul of the rules for
everyone else. While small online donors fuel Obama's rise, McCain's run has
been increasingly dependent on large contributions to his campaign and even
larger ones to the Republican National Committee. In fact, they've set a goa=
l
of raising $120 million for the party alone. And that's how most candidates =
do
it.<br>
<br>
McCain will try to make political hay if Obama chooses not to participate in
the presidential public financing system in the general election. But we
shouldn't forget that McCain himself has already opted in, and then opted ou=
t,
of the presidential system this election cycle. The only reason he's gone
unchecked is the lack of a quorum at the dormant Federal Election Commission=
.<br>
<br>
Relatively little has been written about what the candidates intend to do ab=
out
the cash-and-carry system of paying for campaigns. On the surface, one would
think that the race features two reform candidates. The truth, however, is m=
ore
complex. Like his shift to support President George W. Bush's policies on ta=
x
cuts and off-shore oil drilling, McCain's record on campaign finance reform =
is
decidedly not prologue to what he would support as president.<br>
<br>
McCain once authored a fix to the broken presidential public financing syste=
m
but now refuses to add his name as cosponsor to the same bipartisan
legislation. He once called his state's Clean Elections public financing law=
 a
&quot;national model&quot; but now states he opposes its extension to all
federal races.<br>
<br>
Obama has cosponsored both and has said that their passage would be a priori=
ty
if elected.<br>
<br>
McCain's campaign website rightly identifies one aspect of the problem of mo=
ney
in politics, stating that &quot;the most influential lobbyists with the grea=
test
access in the nation's Capitol are also the most prolific political
fundraisers,&quot; but, according to Public Citizen, McCain has five times t=
he
number of lobbyists as Obama -- 70 to 14 -- raising money for his campaign.<=
br>
<br>
Under comprehensive public financing systems, like those operating successfu=
lly
in a number of states around the country, candidates would rely little if at
all on lobbyists and fundraisers like Clayton Williams. Perhaps that's the
ultimate lesson for McCain from the canceled fundraiser in Texas. Don't just
vet the fundraisers. Overhaul the system.<br>

Republican John McCain will bring his presidential campaign to Minnesota for
the first time today, holding an early evening town hall meeting in St. Paul
with a select group of undecided voters after a late afternoon fundraiser in
Minneapolis. <br>
None of the events is open to the public. <br>
<br>
An earlier public event tentatively planned for Eagan has been canceled, a
campaign aide said. <br>
<br>
Facing a November showdown with Democrat Barack Obama, McCain hopes to push
purple Minnesota into the red column for the first time in 36 years and pick=
 up
some much-needed cash in the process. <br>
<br>
Tickets for his fundraising reception, starting at 5:30 p.m. at the Hilton
Minneapolis, range from $1,000 a person for dinner to a private reception fo=
r
individuals and couples who raise $50,000. <br>
<br>
<b>The Arizona senator needs the money. Through April, Obama had raised $265
million to McCain's $97 million. <br>
</b><br>
The town hall meeting will be at the Landmark Center in downtown St. Paul, j=
ust
a block from the Xcel Energy Center where McCain will receive the Republican
presidential nomination in September. <br>
<br>
<b>The event is by ticket only. The campaign did not say how they selected
undecided voters to attend the meeting. <br>
</b><br>
<b>The crowd will not come close to matching the 30,000 people who swarmed t=
he
&quot;X&quot; on June 3 to hear Obama declare victory in the race for the
Democratic presidential nomination. <br>
</b><br>
McCain's visit suggests he considers Minnesota a battleground state. Althoug=
h
Democrats have carried it in the past eight elections &#8212; their longest =
winning
streak in any state &#8212; the past two presidential contests have been clo=
se. In
2000, Al Gore narrowly defeated George W. Bush, 48 percent to 46 percent, an=
d
four years ago, John Kerry topped Bush 51 percent to 48 percent. <br>
<br>
Polls suggest McCain is within striking distance in Minnesota. The most rece=
nt
one showed he and Obama are virtually tied. <br>
<br>
Obama led McCain, 47 percent to 46 percent, in a Survey USA poll released
Monday. That survey, conducted for KSTP-TV and two other Minnesota televisio=
n
stations, had a 4.3 percentage point margin of error, making the race a dead
heat. <br>
<br>
But the average of the three most recent statewide polls gives Obama a 9-poi=
nt
lead, 50 percent to 41 percent. The Rasmussen Report and the Star Tribune's
Minnesota Poll conducted the other surveys. <br>
<br>
&quot;It is clearly a dead heat,&quot; Ben Golnik, McCain's regional campaig=
n
manager, said Wednesday. &quot;We think we've out-organized Obama. Our offic=
es
opened ahead of theirs. We have more staff on the ground, and we feel good
about it.&quot; <br>
<br>
In addition, Gov. Tim Pawlenty is McCain's national campaign co-chairman and=
 is
frequently mentioned as a possible running mate. But when asked to comment o=
n
McCain's visit, Pawlenty said ... nothing. He failed to respond to a Pioneer
Press request for an interview on the event. <br>
<br>
He did, however, find time to publicly criticize Obama before the Democratic
candidate held his St. Paul rally. <br>
<br>
But the governor has not had a discernible impact on the presidential race i=
n
Minnesota so far, said Donna Cassutt, associate chair of the state
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. <br>
<br>
&quot;Minnesotans are not buying what John McCain is selling, and Gov. Pawle=
nty
is not helping him to close the deal,&quot; Cassutt said. &quot;As we recall=
,
Gov. Pawlenty couldn't even carry his own party's caucuses for McCain.&quot;=
 <br>
<br>
McCain finished a distant second behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romne=
y
in Minnesota's Feb. 5 Republican precinct caucuses. <br>
<br>
But McCain won 35 of the 41 Republican National Convention delegates elected=
 at
GOP conventions around Minnesota this spring.<br>
