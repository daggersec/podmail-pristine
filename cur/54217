You never washed your underpants and socks before. Why are you starting now=

Quick follow-on for just you two:
=20
Laundry service here is contracted out.  Free for service members, but no
more than 20 items per laundry bag (strictly enforced).  Service is actuall=
y
pretty good: wash, dry, and fold in 24 hours.  In a typical day I dirty a
pair of boot socks, a pair of underpants, an undershirt, a pair of athletic
socks, a pair of PT shorts, and a PT shirt.  Throw in a uniform top and
pants and I am at 20 items every three days.
=20
I learned yesterday that under the terms of the contract, the US taxpayer
pays $25 per bag of laundry.  Assuming I have to drop a bag every three
days, the taxpayer will pay $250 per month or $1,750 over the course of thi=
s
deployment on my laundry alone (mind you, we haven't even factored in towel=
s
and sheets).  One of my coworkers has seven laundry bags and drops off a
load of laundry every single day ($5,250 over a 210 day deployment).
=20
I'll kindly ask that you join me in being quietly appalled by this.  To the
extent you wish to describe to others, please do not quote me by name.

When I learned that I was deploying to support a contracting command, I
figured I would learn about the Afghan economy.  What I hadn=B9t figured was
that those lessons would have nothing to do with my official duties.
When I stepped off the helo pad at Camp Phoenix and into my office for the
first time I was immediately introduced to GS-15 DoD employee.  She asked m=
e
how many =B3cartouches=B2I wished to purchase.  A cartouche, I learned, is a
cheap pendant necklace engraved on one side with an English name and on the
other with the same name in Dari (or so they claim; it may well say Go Home
American Swine for all any of us know). I initially demurred but eventually
relented and agreed to purchase three.  Even that compromise was met with a=
n
incredulous look and a puzzled =B3just three?=B2 The interaction seemed odd but
I figured that I just happened to arrive as a bulk order was being placed
and that purchases like this were atypical.  I was wrong.
My coworkers spend multiple duty hours each and every day shopping at the
bazaars.  They buy jewelry.  They buy rugs.  They buy electronics.  They bu=
y
fur coats.  Fur coats! Not a day goes by without someone coming into my
office to show off a new purchase.  My Afghanistan workplace is Project
Runway and I=B9m Tim Gunn=8BI disapprove of everything around me and hope
everyone will be sent home.
Yesterday a handful of them reviewed their bank statements to figure out ho=
w
much they=B9ve spent since being here.  Consensus was between five and ten
thousand dollars.
Throughout my life I=B9ve been called cheap.  Throughout my life I=B9ve been
called crotchety.  So maybe this is just a continuation of the same but I
thoroughly disapprove.  Rather than speak up, however, I sit here meekly an=
d
feign agreement with the ridiculous notion that a mink fur will look
resplendent at the Dyess Officers=B9 Club in Abilene, TX when she redeploys
this summer.
Hope you are well.  Love and miss you all.  And no, I will not put in
purchase orders for you.  Gabe
