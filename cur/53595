Thanks for this.  Jim is first rate. Would be valuable to get them
together. And he seems to be working tirelessly on transition stuff.  In
my humble opinion, we need to empower him to press ahead on some
planning stuff and make him the cluster head of the national security
team. =20

This economy is crazy.  What is happening here?  This has to push Bush
to the absolute bottom and earn him the moniker of worst president ever.


You doing all right?=20

How would you like me to respond to this?  I received a separate message
on Jim J. I'll forward you.

Denis and I were chatting and we thought that it would be good to get
Jim S in the mix for a meeting with O, for a # of reasons:=20

1) O may end up prefering Jim over the other guy, 2) we want Jim to have
a key role/big job no matter what the outcome of #1 and 3) the other guy
could say no. =20

Jim was on the trip, but his ability to spend much time with O was quite
limited.  Despite all of us expressing our high regard for Jim, there is
no substitute for a little face to face time w/ Jim.  Another option
might be to put Jim on the plane for a leg, under the guise of him
briefing O on an issue (like McFaul did).  O you can have a failry
private chat on the plane at the table. =20

Thoughts?
