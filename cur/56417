Hi guys
Here's a update on where we are with the Davenport event on Saturday (along
with some Des Moines canvasses with GPs).  This touches multiple people so
I added everyone.  Let me know if you have any questions.

*Leader Speakers/Pre-Program:*

1.  Terry O'Sullivan, LIUNA GP (+John Penn for clutch)
2.  Doug McCarron, UBC GP
3.  Eric Dean, Ironworkers GP
4.  J. David Cox, AFGE GP (+AFGE VP for clutch)
5.  Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU/UFCW, President/Exec VP (+Messer and Roger for
clutch)
6.  Tony Reardon, NTEU, President (**NEW ADDITION)
7.  IUPAT Ken Rigmaiden President (he will be swapped out for a VP)
8.  Danny Homan, AFSCME Council 61, President
9.  Tammy Wawro, ISEA, President
10.  Kirk Adams and/or Kathy Gleason, SEIU

**I think we should talk thru the labor clutch.  I want to make sure needed
Iowa state labor leaders are in the clutch as well, even if not speaking in
the pre-program.  What size is the cut off?

Suggestion, on pre-program...have a identified a Iowa labor canvasser that
could be the MC.  We did this in Boston with a apprentice and it worked out
really well.  She talked about why she supports HRC and that she was a
union member and she introduced each of the speakers.

*Canvass and Rally Counts*

*Total Rally Count for Today:  505* (I think these numbers are accurate
based on my conversations today with each and do NOT include ISEA, AFSCME,
Insulators and Machinists)
LIUNA  100
UBC  100
IUPAT 50
UFCW 30
UA 70
AFGE 30
Ironworkers 100
SEIU  25
(Machinists and Insulators who will have bodies and projections tomorrow.)

***TROY*-Can you talk to AFSCME and ISEA about their Davenport turn out?
Better to ask the Iowa folks for their counts I thought.

*Davenport Canvass Packet Count (without
AFSCME/ISEA/Insulators/Machinists):  275 packets*

*Des Moines Canvass Packet Count (only include UBC + LIUNA):  100 packets*

Question:  Can we rope off space for folks that took canvass packets so
that if they return to Danceland at 3pm they get the best area as a reward??
Question:  Do we have burner phones that people could use for phoning from
Danceland if they are unable to walk?

*UFCW:*
Location:  Danceland
Numbers:  25 packets

*UA:*
Location:  Danceland
Numbers:  40 packets

*AFGE:*
Location:  Danceland
Numbers:  10 packets

*Ironworkers:*
Location:  Danceland
Numbers:  50 packets

*SEIU:*
Location:  Danceland Staging for Canvass
Numbers:  25 packets
***On Sunday, this team of 25 will go to the Cedar Rapids office to walk.
 (Jake note)
Kirk Adams is confirmed to attend (Kathy is tentative)  They should both be
in clutch.

*LIUNA:*
They are canvassing in both Des Moines and Davenport with President
O'Sullivan

Des Moines LIUNA Canvass
Location:  LIUNA Local 177
Numbers:  50 packets
**LIUNA is requesting turf from the east side or south side of Des Moines
for their members.  (Jake note)
Can a HFA staff person or two arrive at 9am at Local 177 with packets for
distribution?   They would also appreciate a staff person that could do a
quick training if needed.

Davenport LIUNA Canvass
Location:  LIUNA Local 309 Hall, Rock Island
Numbers:  50 packets (will confirm tomorrow)

*UBC:*
They are canvassing in both Des Moines and Davenport with President
McCarron:

Des Moines UBC Canvass
Location:  TBD (I believe UBC Hall)
Time:  10:30am kick off
Numbers:  50 packets

Davenport UBC Canvass
Location:  Danceland
Number:  25 packets

*IUPAT Canvass:*
Location:  IUPAT Hall in Quad Cities
Time:  9:30am (rally/kick off/canvass)
Numbers:  50-75 packets needed (to confirm tomorrow)
*They would like to return their first packets to Danceland around 1:30pm
and then take a half packet back out at 1:30pm...the purpose is to kill the
hour so they're there for the rally.

IUPAT would like to space at Danceland at 12:30pm-1pm to set up table to
collect returned packets and provide a sandwich for members to pick up
after returning.  I can figure this out on the ground I just wanted to flag
for advance.  This is the only union doing it backwards.
