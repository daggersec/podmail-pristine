John,

A pipeline reaching from Canada to Texas has been proposed, and President O=
bama has a chance to stop it. Not only does the extraction and transportati=
on of this oil produce more carbon emissions than traditional oil, it poses=
 a huge spill risk to the six states the pipeline would run through. After =
the BP oil spill in the gulf, and the ExxonMobil spill in Yellowstone River=
, we need to stand up against
these risks.

Please, join our friends at CREDO and tell president Obama to stop the Keys=
tone XL pipeline: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3Db-07NStDB6K1Y8ydMulMNQ .

- Gene

"The tar sands represent a catastrophic threat to our communities, our

Dear John,

"Essentially game over" for the climate.

That's what climate scientist James Hansen calls the proposed Keystone XL p=
ipeline=A0-- which would carry oil out of Canada's vast tar sands oil field=
s to Texas, where it will be refined, then burned across the globe, dealing=
 a catastrophic blow to our chance of returning earth to a stable climate.

This project requires a permit from President Obama to start construction. =
He will make the decision as soon as September.

 petition: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DZsqyOLkZEX3ofaNr85dVZQ .

The Alberta tar sands -- the 3rd largest oil field in the world -- is a car=
bon bomb. The difficult extraction and transportation of the tar sands oil =
ultimately produces up to three times the carbon emissions of traditional o=
il. (And extreme environmental devastation along the way.)[1]

The Keystone XL pipeline is the fuse to this bomb=A0-- a highway to swift c=
onsumption of this dirty, dangerous crude. As if that wasn't enough, it pos=
es a massive spill risk in the six states along the pipeline route, includi=
ng over the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides up to 30% of our nation's agri=
cultural water.

We. Must. Stop. This.

Tell President Obama: Stop the Keystone XL pipeline. Click here to sign the=
 petition: http://action.lcv.org/site/R?i=3DShLGjxE-J5bznYkngLvz1Q .

Twenty leading climate scientists recently sent a letter to President Obama=
 urging him to deny the permit.

And right now, a massive, historic daily sit-in is occurring outside the Wh=
ite House.=A0The peaceful protests began on August 20th and will continue e=
very day until September 3rd.=A0Hundreds of people -- including CREDO's CEO=
 Michael Kieschnick -- are joining acclaimed climate activist Bill McKibben=
 in risking arrest outside the White House.

Yet given Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's comment that she was "inclin=
ed" to approve Keystone XL, there is reason to be concerned.

But President Obama still has the final word. He does not have to negotiate=
 with Congress or industry. He can still do the right thing.=A0We need a ma=
ssive, historic show of pressure to stop this pipeline. Please sign the pet=
ition and read below for other ways to get involved.
