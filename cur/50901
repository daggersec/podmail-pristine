Friend,

Well, that didn't take long -- Bruce Rauner just donated ANOTHER huge a=
mount to his campaign=2E=20

That brings the total he's spent of his own money to take over the gove=
rnor's mansion to nearly $10 million=2E=20

The good news is, thanks to thousands of people like you pitching in wh=
at they can, we're still in this fight=2E

But we can't let up for a minute=2E=20

Donate $5 or more today to help prevent Bruce Rauner from buying his wa=
y into control of this state:

https://www=2Equinnforillinois=2Ecom/donate-now

At the end of the day, this is about people, not money=2E Every donatio=
n, no matter how big or how small, sends a message to Bruce Rauner that=
 Illinois is not for sale=2E=20

Let's make sure he hears it loud and clear=2E

Thanks=2E
