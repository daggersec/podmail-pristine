Rep. Blackburn touts Social Security privatization.<http://thinkprogress.or=
g/2010/02/09/blackburn-privatize-socialsecurity/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2010/02/09/blackburn-privatize-socialsecurity/

Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), one of the cosponsors to the radical budget<h=
ttp://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/02/06/conservatives-ryan-budget/> pro=
posal authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), went on Fox News yesterday to floa=
t one of the budget's key components. Heralding "personal [Social Security]=
 accounts" for "younger earners," Blackburn touted Social Security privatiz=
ation as the only way "you could get some of this under control":

BLACKBURN: You know, people forget Medicare is a program that individuals h=
ave paid into every single year with their Medicare and their Social Securi=
ty beneifts the federal government has first right of refusal on that paych=
eck. And this is one of the reasons we need to make sure individuals get th=
e money out that they have placed in. This is one of the reasons we have ha=
d the discussion over and over for our younger earners of having accounts t=
hat have their Social Security number and their information on that - perso=
nal accounts.

VARNEY: You're right, but it was roundly rejected when President Bush sugge=
sted doing just that. Didn't fly. [...]

BLACKBURN: I was just going to say, and it's interesting to me the number o=
f people now that are coming to town hall meetings and are saying 'you know=
 what, if you were to scale back some of this bureaucracy and you began to =
look at some options for younger workers, you could get some of this under =
control.'

Watch it:

While Varney seemed supportive of the idea of subjecting the retirement saf=
ety net to the whims of the stock market, he rightly noted that President B=
ush's attempt was "roundly rejected." Indeed, if Bush were successful at hi=
s push to do what Ryan and Blackburn are proposing now, seniors would have =
lost tens of thousands<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/02/06/conserv=
atives-ryan-budget/> of dollars in the 2008-2009 market plunge.
