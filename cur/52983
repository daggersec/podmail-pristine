*Former Insurance Co Executive: Don=92t Believe Insurance Industry Spin,
Baucus Bill Is Dream Come True For Industry*

Ex-Cigna Executive Says Senate Finance Committee Bill
Good for Industry, Bad for Americans

In Addition To TV Ad, Print Ad Out Today Lauds Leaders
Who Voted For Public Option in Committee

A new TV ad released today by MoveOn.org features former insurance company
executive, Wendell Potter, calling the Senate Finance Committee=92s health
care bill a dream come true for the insurance companies. The ad was release=
d
in advance of today=92s Finance Committee vote, and in response to the
insurance companies lobbyist spin slamming the bill yesterday.

In the ad, Wendell Potter--a former top executive at two health insurance
companies=97says that the Finance bill is a victory for the industry becaus=
e
it does not contain a public health insurance option. A public option is ke=
y
to creating competition that will help lower costs and keep the insurance
industry honest.

The Senate Finance Committee recently rejected two public option amendments
to its health care reform legislation. The health insurance industry has
spent millions of dollars to fight robust health care reform, including a
public health insurance option. The Senate Finance bill is the only bill ou=
t
of five in either chamber to omit a public option.

=93Don=92t believe the insurance companies=92 spin, trust me, I used to wri=
te it,
" said Wendell Potter. "A bill without a public option, like the Senate
Finance bill, might as well be called Health Insurance Industry Profit
Protection and Enhancement Act. The insurance companies will not reform
themselves. We need a strong public option to keep the industry honest and
lower the costs for all Americans.=94

=93The industry is crying crocodile tears because they didn=92t get to writ=
e the
entire legislation to their own benefit. Despite the fact that they kept a
public option from being included in the Baucus bill, they still want more
protections for their record profits,=94 said Justin Ruben, Executive Direc=
tor
of MoveOn. =93Wendell Potter is a powerful voice to cut through the spin
coming from the insurance companies. It=92s time the move the bill to the
House and Senate floor where we will continue to fight for the reform a
majority of Americans want =96 a robust public option to help lower costs a=
nd
keep the insurance industry honest.=94

The ad will run on national cable for one week.

In addition, MoveOn.org placed a full-page ad in Politico this week
commending the leadership of the ten Democratic Senators who voted for the
public option amendment in committee. The ad can be viewed here:

About Wendell Potter: From 2001-2008, Potter served as Vice President,
Corporate Communications and Chief Corporate Spokesperson for Cigna
Corporation. Prior to his work at Cigna, Potter served as Director of
Corporate Communications for Humana. Potter is now a Senior Fellow at the
Center for Media and Democracy.  His blogs can be found at www.prwatch.org
