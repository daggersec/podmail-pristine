=09<p>Here is the information for the Friday and Saturday packet pickup:=20

=09<p><b>Packet Pick-up over Two Days at the National Building Museum:</b> =
Here is the information you will need to pick up your packet before the rac=
e.=20

=09<p>Packet pick-up will take place on the second floor of the Health and =
Fitness Expo on Friday, April 4 between 3:00 P.M. and 8:45 P.M. (<b>Note ne=
w Friday hours</b>) and Saturday, April 5 between 9:00 A.M. and 4:45 P.M. (=
sharp!) at the spectacular National Building Museum, 401 F St., NW, Washing=
ton, DC (<a href=3D"http://www.nbm.org/about-us" target=3D"_blank">www.nbm.=
org/about-us</a>). The National Building Museum is located directly opposit=
e the Judiciary Square Metro stop on the Red Line. Metro use is strongly en=
couraged; parking is difficult to find and expensive!=20

<p><b><i>There is no Sunday pick</i></b>-<b><i>up at the race site on the W=
ashington Monument Grounds</i></b>. <b><i>No exceptions</i></b>. Details ab=
out having someone else pick-up your number on Friday or Saturday appear be=
low.=20

<p>We have two suggestions to minimize crowding at the National Building Mu=
seum. <i>First</i>, <i>avoid trying to pick up your packet the moment packe=
t pick</i>-<i>up opens on either Friday or Saturday</i>. Last year, we had =
lines at the opening times which dissipated an hour later and never reforme=
d. Second, we are asking you to pick up your packets based on the following=
 schedule based on the first letter of your last name. We realize that your=
 personal schedule may not allow this or you may be picking up with a group=
. However, if a decent percentage of entrants adhere to this schedule, it w=
ill ease the flow for everyone.

 banned from future races at the discretion of the organizing committee.

<p><b>Charity Fundraiser Updates</b>: Every day is filled with decisions. F=
ew are between life and death. As a fundraiser in support of Children's Mir=
acle Network Hospitals and the Credit Union Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run, yo=
u have an opportunity to say "yes" to life for thousands of sick and injure=
d children.=20

<p>Asking your friends and family to support you in the run can be a strugg=
le. But as you ask, remember all the children who struggle with challenges =
far beyond anything we can imagine. There are children who are told "no" ev=
ery day -- "No, your blood counts are still too low." "No, you're too sick =
to go outside and play today."

<p>If you are an Individual Fundraiser, we encourage you to continue your e=
fforts right up to the day of the run. If you have not signed up yet to be =
an Individual Fundraiser, you can do so by visiting <a href=3D"http://www.h=

<p><b>Watch Your Email Inbox for Our Virtual Goodie Bag</b>! We will be ema=
iling everyone our "Virtual Goodie Bag" around March 25. This environmental=
ly-friendly electronic "goodie bag" replaces the usual clutter which lies i=
n the bottom of the old fashioned goodie bag with dozens of clickable elect=
ronic coupons, information and offers for our sponsors and other vendors. H=
owever, we will still be distributing clear plastic bags at packet pick-up =
which must be used for bag check on race day.=20


<p><b>You Made It Easier to Be Green: </b>Thanks to everyone's efforts to r=

<br><b>Metro to Travel to the Race Site:</b> Metro will open at 5:00 A.M. o=
n race day. The staging area is 1/4 mile from the Smithsonian Metro stop.

<p><b>Important Information about Time Limits:</b> In order to balance the =
interests of tourists in town for cherry blossom season and the participant=
s in the race, we need to close the 10-mile course promptly at 10:30 A.M.. =
Runners who are not maintaining a 14-minute per mile pace or faster will ha=
ve to leave the course at the 5-mile mark (located about 1/4 mile from the =
start-finish line). Runners who fall behind the 14-minute per mile pace dur=
ing the second half of the race will need to board our sweep bus and be dri=
ven to the finish line. If you don't think you will be maintaining a 14-min=
ute per mile pace, you should switch your entry to the 5K Run-Walk. You can=
 do this by completing a form available on the main race website, <a href=
=3D"http://www.cherryblossom.org" target=3D"_blank">www.cherryblossom.org</=
a>. Please be aware that at this late date you will be running the 5K Run-W=
alk with your 10-mile bib number. We will not reissue you a 5K bib number. =
Your "B-Tag" will be "read" by the ChronoTrack system and you will be score=
d in whichever race you actually run.=20

<p>Go gently on your training these last few weeks. I know if you are a par=
ticipant in our Virtual Training program that Coach Kirt West is rounding y=
ou into shape to meet your race goal. We send our best wishes for personal =
best times for everyone.=20

<p>Remember, to speed up the packet pick-up process, bring this confirmatio=
n letter with you to the National Building Museum on Friday or Saturday and=
 remember that there is no packet pick-up on the Washington Monument Ground=
s on Sunday.=20
