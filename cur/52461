Mitt Romney Refuses To Say If The Foundation Of The Massachusetts Health Sy=
stem Is Constitutional<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/03/05/romney-mandate-c=
onstitutional/>

http://thinkprogress.org/2010/03/05/romney-mandate-constitutional/

In recent days, former Gov. Mitt Romney (R-MA) has tried to simultaneously =
tear down President Obama's proposals to reform healthcare, while defending=
 his own legacy of reforming healthcare in Massachusetts. Romney's health p=
lan<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/03/05/romney-mandate-massachuset=
ts/> includes an expansion of Medicaid using $385 million<http://wonkroom.t=
hinkprogress.org/2010/01/21/brown-federal-money/> in annual Federal money, =
as well as an individual mandate and a sliding scale of subsidies. Today, 9=
8% of Bay State residents have quality, highly regulated coverage. Defendin=
g his plan last night, Romney told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that the on=
ly way the Massachusetts "system can work<http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,29=
33,588107,00.html?utm_source=3Dtwitterfeed&utm_medium=3Dtwitter>" is by hav=
ing an individual mandate.

Fighting to kill health reform, the right-wing has attacked the individual =
mandate as unconstitutional. Along with a cadre of Republican Congressmen, =
Sens. Jim DeMint<http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=3D34977> (R-SC),=
 John Ensign<http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=3D34977> (R-NV), and=
 Orrin Hatch<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/09/23/hatch-mandate/> (=
R-UT) have said that the individual mandate violates the constitution. Simi=
larly, as a ThinkProgress investigation<http://thinkprogress.org/2009/12/05=
/bcbs-alec-health/> has found, insurance company lobbyists have orchestrate=
d an effort to use state legislatures to pass resolutions condemning the in=
dividual mandate as unconstitutional. An individual mandate is absolutely n=
ecessary<http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/12/draft_1.html> =
for health reform to work. Simply put, the right has hoped to kill health r=
eform by undermining the individual mandate.

Today at the Press Club, Romney again tore into<http://voices.washingtonpos=
t.com/44/2010/03/mitt-romney-criticizes-obama-f.html?wprss=3D44> Obama's ef=
forts on health reform. After the speech, ThinkProgress caught up with Romn=
ey to ask him about the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Romney=
 refused to answer if the individual mandate, which underpins his own Massa=
chusetts system, is even constitutional:

TP: What do you think about the current effort to declare the individual ma=
ndate as unconstitutional?

ROMNEY: You know I've got a long discussion that I could give you on that, =
but I'm in too harp hay of a hurry right now but I think we have that on th=
e site.

TP: Do you think it's constitutional though, I mean just as a quick answer.

ROMNEY: I think I've answered that the best way I can right now which is it=
's a big topic and I'm happy to discuss it at length but I just can't do it=
 in the hall going to the elevator.

TP: Well I mean it is constitutional though, right?

Watch it:

On Romney's website, there is no mention<http://www.google.com/search?hl=3D=
en&rlz=3D1C1GGLS_enUS358US358&q=3Dmandate+site:freestrongamerica.com&aq=3Df=
&aqi=3D&aql=3D&oq=3D> of the individual mandate. During the 2008 Republican=
 primary, Romney famously crept to the far right, flip flopping<http://www.=
washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/04/AR2008020402805.html> =
on many core issues to appease the right-wing base. With Romney refusing to=
 state if the core foundation of his own health plan is even constitutional=
, Romney is again pandering to far right conservatives.

Last year, Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA), a close ally of Romney, said the Senate=
 health reform bill "mirrors<http://thinkprogress.org/2010/02/04/brown-supp=
ort-senatehealth/>" the Massachusetts system Brown and Romney helped enact.=
 And as Igor Volsky details, the current version of reform Congress is prep=
aring to enact stillresembles<http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/03/05/=
romney-mandate-massachusetts/> the Massachusetts plan, except that Obama's =
reform proposals do far more to control costs. However, Romney is making a =
political calculation by attacking health reform. With Romney refusing to s=
tate if the core foundation of his own health plan is even constitutional, =
Romney is again pandering to far right conservatives.
