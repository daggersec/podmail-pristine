Tony…

 

Thanks for sending the documents to me.  Unfortunately the few resources
I thought may be able to help with translations do not believe
themselves to be skilled enough to do so.  If you have a contact who
might be willing to help out, let me know how to contact them.  I’d be
happy to come to DC with the documents you sent me and the ones Eugenia
gave me which are not duplicates to meet with whomever.

 

Hope all is going well for everyone…please win this election!

 

Love,

 

Patti
