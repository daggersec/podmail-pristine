Dear Trustees,

If a beautiful Homecoming weekend, the rededication of Alumni Hall and the
endorsement of Knox 2018 weren't enough, now we have this wonderful victory
by our men's soccer team.  Take a look at their roster, here
<http://prairiefire.knox.edu/roster.aspx?path=msoc>, to see Knox's
commitment to global citizenship in action!

Best,

Teresa

*Men's Soccer Captures Conference Season*

The Prairie Fire men's soccer team outlasted St. Norbert College 1-0 in
overtime Saturday at Jorge Prats Field and made history, winning its first
regular season conference championship since the inauguration of the
conference tournament more than 30 years ago. View game and season photos

[image: Shu Kitamura '18 celebrates with a teammate after scoring the
winning goal.]Knox won the Midwest Conference regular season championship
with the victory, combined with Carroll University's 4-3 loss against
Illinois College. The Prairie Fire will be the top seed and host the 2014
Midwest Conference Men's Soccer tournament on November 7 and 8. Knox last
won a conference title in men's soccer in 1988, the year before the MWC
tournament began. *Photo: Shu Kitamura '18 celebrates with a teammate after
scoring the winning goal.*

The Prairie Fire and St. Norbert (9-4-3, 3-2-3 MWC) battled through
regulation and the first overtime deadlocked in a scoreless draw.

The second overtime had barely started when first-year Shu Kitamura (Hong
Kong, IMG Academy) took a pass from junior Abdulsalam Oganla (Lagos,
Nigeria, The International Academy) and kicked in the winning goal, his
first of the season, to give Knox a school-record 12th straight victory.
The score came at the 100:39 mark of the contest.

The Prairie Fire (13-2, 8-0 MWC) also ended a long drought against the
Green Knights, winning for the first time since September of 2000.

Senior goalie Sean Dockrell (Dublin, Ireland, San Bernadino CC) had three
saves and recorded his fifth straight shutout and ninth overall this
season, which leads the Midwest Conference.

Knox hosts Illinois College in the regular season home finale and Senior
Day on Wednesday, Oct. 29 at 1:30 p.m. The Blueboys (9-5-2, 5-2-1 MWC) have
16 conference points and are tied for third in the team standings with
Carroll and Monmouth College, one point behind second place Lake Forest
College. Learn more about Prairie Fire men's soccer
