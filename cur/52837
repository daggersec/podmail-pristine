On second thought, based on our convo does it make sense to wait for Eric in=
tro until you have more guidance after this meeting tomorrow?=20

How are you?Jim and I have been discussing what our role could possibly be a=
ssisting the MOH and we have come up with an idea that we feel is needed and=
 could be very successful.<br>


Jim has been speaking with the CDC on a regular basis and I have weekly call=
s from everyone in Monrovia- Daniel, nurses from Redemption, Dr. Idoko, even=
 James my driver (!) so we have a pretty good handle on what the situation i=
s and where it appears to be going.<br>


<br>


Jim and I both feel that our team (you, Peter, Jim and I) left a very positi=
ve "legacy" in Liberia- I think the MOH and Pres Sirleaf saw the value in ou=
r work so returning would not be perceived as a threat to their ability to r=
ebuild the health system. Both Jim and I like to work under the radar with t=
he kudos given to the MOH so I think our project would be welcomed. <br>


<br>


In a nutshell-<br>


(1) Bring in MD teams for 30 day periods- the stress and the ability to only=
 wear haz suits for 2 hrs due to the heat wears down people very quickly and=
 that leads to errors in judgment and clinical decision-making. We would lim=
it each team to 30 days- fresh legs, fresh minds and limited exposure to pro=
tect the teams will produce positive outcomes. Mandatory inservice prior to c=
oming would be required and we could have Yale or CDC develop it for the vol=
unteers.<br>


<br>


(2) Develop a "par level" of supplies, equip, FOOD and WATER for patients an=
d staff, all necessary equip required to treat these patients- assure that e=
ach facility has these supplies and oversee the supply chain to maintain par=
 levels esp food- you cannot quarantine people and not give them food and wa=
ter. We would work closely with the MOH to oversee the distribution of those=
 supplies and assure they meet the determined par levels. <br>


<br>


(3) Although we would be working closely with the MOH and JFK we would have t=
o have an agreement with Dr. G that we would have decision-making ability in=
 the distribution of medical teams and supplies coming into the country. One=
 of the problems that we are hearing is that "no one" seems to be in control=
 of the process- that is where we would come in. If we could take on the ebo=
la problem, they could focus on rebuilding the health system, getting staff b=
ack to work and treating the other patients in the country.<br>


<br>


(4) We would need a sponsor- Clinton Foundation would be great as the Liberi=
ans love BC and respect him and we would have a degree of trust from the dif=
ferent staffs at the hospitals and MOH. Do you know anyone there that we cou=
ld contact? I would contact Betsy but not sure if she would be able to move q=
uickly on this proposal. But if you think she would be good I am happy to co=
ntact her. I need your advice on this part. I can go to the USG but Jim and I=
 really think CF would be the perfect fit.<br>


<br>


So that is just a brief idea of what we are thinking- we will be meeting nex=
t week to develop a proposal but I wanted to spin it by you first. You are t=
he expert :)&nbsp; <br>


If you are in the city let me know and I can meet you any evening next week-=
 except Thurs. Please be honest in critiquing our idea. If you see other opp=
ortunities for us to help let us know. <br>
