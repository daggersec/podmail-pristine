Dear Colleagues,

I  am writing to share with you the news that after four and a half years o=
f top notch, dedicated service to my office and the entire Law Center commu=
nity, Katie Wrede is concluding her time as my executive assistant.  As man=
y of you may know, in Fall 2012, Katie was admitted to the Law Center=92s e=
vening program.  Since then, she has been supporting my office full time wh=
ile at the same time working diligently as a law student.  Katie will begin=
 her final year this Fall, and will now be able to focus full time on her s=
tudies and her life and career beyond law school.  Katie=92s last day worki=
ng in the office will be tomorrow, Friday, May 15th<x-apple-data-detectors:=
//0>, having concluded another year of meritorious service as we move on to=
 this year=92s graduation ceremonies.

Since her arrival in December 2010, Katie has been an integral part of my s=
taff. As you know, she welcomed numerous visiting guests, scheduled (and of=
ten rescheduled!) countless meetings, and managed my calendar, itself a mov=
ing target.  Katie=92s professionalism and grace in the face of the constan=
t flow of activity and changes in plans are both indicative of her dedicati=
on to the Law Center and a tribute to her.  I thank Katie for her exception=
al support these past years, and will miss her.

Please join me in thanking and congratulating Katie on her contributions to=
 the Law Center and wishing her well on her final year in law school.

Sincerely,

Bill
