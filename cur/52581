Budget Battle Opens Two Huge Rifts Within GOP
=20
     The ongoing battle over the federal budget and the role of government =
in America has certainly clarified the fundamental difference in the vision=
s of the Republican and Democratic Parties =96 and the progressive and cons=
ervative forces within American society.
=20
      At the same time, however, the budget battle has also opened up two g=
aping rifts within the Republican Party itself.  The first threatens to do =
massive damage to the GOP=92s election chances in 2012.  The second may cau=
se the collapse of its 2011 legislative agenda.
=20
      First is the seemingly irreconcilable conflict between the =93Tea Par=
ty=94 class of GOP =93young turks=94 -- who want to go for broke to destroy=
 the New Deal and impose their social agenda -- and those elements of the P=
arty whose highest concern is winning general elections.
=20
     More =93moderate=94 Republicans like Olympia Snowe and Dick Lugar are =
terrified of being defeated in primaries by Tea Party insurgents who are ea=
ger to take advantage of any deviation from ultra-right orthodoxy.  But the=
y know very well that purist right wing positions like ending Medicare and =
privatizing Social Security are the kiss of death in general elections.
=20
    Last week, Newt Gingrich became the poster boy for the corrosive effect=
 of this conflict, as the nation watched him pleading for forgiveness from =
the right for his characterization of Paul Ryan=92s Republican budget as =
=93extremist right wing social engineering.=94  Even though Gingrich himsel=
f remains a hard core right wing ideologue, he has had an experience many o=
f the Tea Party newcomers have not: he knows what it=92s like to lose.
=20
     Gingrich is smart enough to know that it=92s one thing to prevent peop=
le from achieving their aspirations =96 it=92s quite another to take someth=
ing away that they already have =96 that they=92ve already paid for =96 lik=
e Medicare and Social Security.   He can read the polls that show almost 80=
% of the electorate wants Congress to keep its hands off Medicare and Socia=
l Security.  And almost as many oppose cutting or restructuring Medicaid.  =
Remember that Medicaid not only provides health care for the working poor, =
and children, but also provides nursing home care -- and home care that let=
s seniors and the disabled stay in their own homes instead of institutions.
=20
     Of course it=92s not just Gingrich that is caught in the vise between =
primaries dominated by well-organized right wing ideologues and a general e=
lectorate that has no use for candidates who want to abolish Medicare or de=
fund Planned Parenthood.   The entire Republican presidential field will ha=
ve to cope with this virtually unsolvable conundrum every day during the up=
coming primary season.
=20
     The same difficulty faces GOP Senate challengers and House incumbents.=
   Sixty one D battles for House seats will be fought in districts won by B=
arack Obama in 2008 =96 and fourteen were won by Obama in 2008 and John Ker=
ry in 2004.  In the 2010 elections, seniors voted Republican by 21%.  Now t=
hat the Republican leadership and Ryan=92s =93young guns=94 have rounded up=
 all but four members of the GOP House caucus and got them =96 incredibly =
=96 to cast a public vote to abolish Medicare =96 don=92t expect seniors to=
 flock to their cause again in 2012. =20
=20
     And in case the Republicans didn=92t notice, it=92s not just seniors w=
ho strongly oppose abolishing Medicare.  All of those 45- to 50-year-olds w=
ho would be most directly affected and have paid their Medicare taxes all o=
f these years aren=92t too happy either.
=20
      Before this year is done, many Republican office holders and candidat=
es will feel as though they=92re on a political rack.  On the one side they=
 will find themselves and their colleagues pilloried at town meetings for v=
oting to abolish Medicare.  On the other, they will watch those who are bol=
d enough to distance themselves from the Republican budget =93Koolaid,=94 s=
macked back into line by Tea Party zealots.
=20
     This of course will be great news for Democrats in 2012.  Many Republi=
cans are taking the path of the least short-term pain in order to avoid hum=
iliation in a primary.  They are refusing to distance themselves from Ryan=
=92s politically radioactive proposals.   And of course candidates like Gin=
grich who try to head for a radioactive free zone =96 and then have to reve=
rse themselves =96 look as though  they have cast their principles to the w=
inds.  In politics, appearing to flip flop =96 to have no core commitment t=
o values =96 is often the most toxic quality of all.  Remember, Republicans=
 beat John Kerry by =96 erroneously =96 convincing many swing voters that h=
e was a =93flip flopper.=94
=20
     Already we=92ve seen the power of the Medicare issue to drive swing se=
niors into the Democratic column.  In the Special election for heavily Repu=
blican New York=92s 26th Congressional District, Democrat Kathy Huchel has =
actually surged ahead of Republican Jane Corwin in last-minute polling =96 =
mainly on the strength of the Medicare issue.
=20
     But the Medicare issue doesn=92t just move swing seniors.  The Republi=
can Budget =96 coupled with President Obama=92s response =96 has drawn clea=
r lines between the Democratic and Republican visions for our society.  Tha=
t clear distinction has already reinvigorated the Democratic Party base and=
 will serve to rally Democratic turnout in 2012. =20
=20
     Paul Ryan has given Democrats the gift that will keep on giving right =
through November, 2012.
   =20
     But the second great conflict in the Republican Party will have an imp=
act in just a few months.  That=92s the conflict between the real base of t=
he GOP =96 Wall Street and America=92s corporate elite -- and the Tea Party=
 bomb throwers who are willing to risk allowing America to default on its d=
ebts to advance their ideological goals.
=20
     Now don=92t get me wrong -- much of the Wall Street/corporate CEO crow=
d would love to abolish Medicare and force draconian cuts in the Federal bu=
dget so they could have yet another round of tax cuts and free themselves o=
f =93meddlesome=94 government =93regulation.=94 They would love to be freed=
 to devise exotic trading schemes, sell worthless mortgage securities, dece=
rtify unions and slash middle class salaries, defund public education and a=
ll of the rest.
=20
     But they=92re not interested in risking the collapse of the economy, a=
nd the markets to get it.  They are smart enough to prefer the billions the=
y have in their hot hands,  to the risk that their portfolios will plummet =
in value once again as they did in 2008.  And that is exactly what might ha=
ppen if their erstwhile Tea Party allies force House Speaker John Boehner t=
o play chicken with the nation=92s debt limit in order to pressure the Demo=
crats to scrap big portions of the New Deal.
=20
      Wall Street is terrified by guys like Illinois=92 Republican Congress=
man Joe Walsh who said that default wouldn=92t be so bad =96 that we should=
 be thinking =93outside of the box.=94  Or Congressman Devin Nunes who thin=
ks that a default would benefit America by forcing politicians to go throug=
h a =93period of crisis=94.  These =93default deniers=94 just scare the bej=
ezus out of the investor/CEO class.
=20
     But Boehner has a whole flock of these folks in his caucus, and before=
 the default battle is over he may look like a pancake =96 squeezed by Wall=
 Street on the one side, and by his Tea Party crew on the other.=20
=20
     It is likely that whatever deal to avoid default ultimately emerges fr=
om the Biden talks, will ultimately pass with more Democratic than Republic=
ans votes in both houses.  That means that the deal cannot contain poison p=
ill proposals that are completely unacceptable to most mainstream Democrats=
.  But that, in turn, may very well be unacceptable to the right-wing ideol=
ogues who see the debt-ceiling vote as their one chance to make big changes=
 in the federal budget.
=20
      If Boehner allows a vote on such a proposal =96 and it does indeed pa=
ss with more Democrats than Republicans =96 he is afraid there may be a mut=
iny and he may no longer swing the big House gavel when the smoke clears.
=20
     This kind of division massively weakens the Republican=92s bargaining =
position.  As the prospect of default barrels toward us, looming larger and=
 larger in the weeks ahead, the pressure from the Wall Street/CEO gang will=
 grown unbearable.=20
=20
     The fact of the matter is that the Party=92s big dogs will not allow B=
oehner to pull the plug on the grenade that sends the economy back into a m=
ajor recession and causes markets to plummet.  And of course, if they did, =
the political consequences for the GOP in 2012 would be catastrophic.
=20
     Had the Republicans simply continued to scream about deficits (as hypo=
critical as that may seem) they would have had a much stronger hand. Instea=
d they handed Democrats a politically iconic example of exactly what the wo=
rld would be like if they had their way =96 abolishing Medicare.=20
=20
      Now the Party=92s candidates and its legislative leadership are divid=
ed, confused and in disarray. =20
=20
      In this situation, Democrats and Progressives need to remember one im=
portant axiom: when you=92ve got them on the run, that=92s the time to chas=
e them.

the 2010 elections, seniors voted Republican by 21%.&nbsp; Now that the Rep=
ublican leadership and Ryan=92s
=93young guns=94 have rounded up all but four members of the GOP House cauc=
us and
got them =96 incredibly =96 to cast a public vote to abolish Medicare =96 d=
on=92t
expect seniors to flock to their cause again in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in case the
Republicans didn=92t notice, it=92s not just seniors who strongly oppose ab=
olishing
Medicare.&nbsp; All of those 45- to 50-year-olds
who would be most directly affected and have paid their Medicare taxes all =
of
these years aren=92t too happy either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before this year
is done, many Republican office holders and candidates will feel as though
they=92re on a political rack.&nbsp; On the one
side they will find themselves and their colleagues pilloried at town meeti=
ngs
for voting to abolish Medicare.&nbsp; On the
other, they will watch those who are bold enough to distance themselves fro=
m
the Republican budget =93Koolaid,=94 smacked back into line by Tea Party ze=
alots. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This of course will
be great news for Democrats in 2012.&nbsp;
Many Republicans are taking the path of the least short-term pain in
order to avoid humiliation in a primary.&nbsp;
They are refusing to distance themselves from Ryan=92s politically
radioactive proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course
candidates like Gingrich who try to head for a radioactive free zone =96 an=
d then
have to reverse themselves =96 look as though &nbsp;they have cast their pr=
inciples to the
winds.&nbsp; In politics, appearing to flip
flop =96 to have no core commitment to values =96 is often the most toxic q=
uality
of all.&nbsp; Remember, Republicans beat John
Kerry by =96 erroneously =96 convincing many swing voters that he was a =93=
flip
flopper.=94 <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Already we=92ve
seen the power of the Medicare issue to drive swing seniors into the Democr=
atic
column.&nbsp; In the Special election for
heavily Republican New York=92s 26</span><sup><span class=3D"Apple-style-sp=

Kathy Huchel has actually surged ahead of Republican Jane Corwin in last-mi=
nute

</p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the Medicare
issue doesn=92t just move swing seniors.&nbsp;
The Republican Budget =96 coupled with President Obama=92s response =96 has
drawn clear lines between the Democratic and Republican visions for our soc=
iety.
&nbsp;That clear distinction has already
reinvigorated the Democratic Party base and will serve to rally Democratic
turnout in 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Ryan has
given Democrats the gift that will keep on giving right through November, 2=
012.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the second
great conflict in the Republican Party will have an impact in just a few
months.&nbsp; That=92s the conflict between the
real base of the GOP =96 Wall Street and America=92s corporate elite -- and=
 the Tea
Party bomb throwers who are willing to risk allowing America to default on =
its
debts to advance their ideological goals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now don=92t get me
wrong -- much of the Wall Street/corporate CEO crowd would love to abolish
Medicare and force draconian cuts in the Federal budget so they could have =
yet
another round of tax cuts and free themselves of =93meddlesome=94 governmen=
t
=93regulation.=94 They would love to be freed to devise exotic trading sche=
mes,
sell worthless mortgage securities, decertify unions and slash middle class
salaries, defund public education and all of the rest. <o:p></o:p></span></=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they=92re not
interested in risking the collapse of the economy, and the markets to get
it.&nbsp; They are smart enough to prefer the
billions they have in their hot hands, &nbsp;to the risk that their portfol=
ios will plummet
in value once again as they did in 2008.&nbsp;
And that is exactly what might happen if their erstwhile Tea Party
allies force House Speaker John Boehner to play chicken with the nation=92s=
 debt
limit in order to pressure the Democrats to scrap big portions of the New D=
eal.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wall Street is
terrified by guys like Illinois=92 Republican Congressman Joe Walsh who sai=
d that
default wouldn=92t be so bad =96 that we should be thinking =93outside of t=
he box.=94&nbsp; Or Congressman Devin Nunes who thinks that a
default would benefit America by forcing politicians to go through a =93per=
iod of
crisis=94. &nbsp;These =93default deniers=94 just
scare the bejezus out of the investor/CEO class. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=
size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Boehner has a
whole flock of these folks in his caucus, and before the default battle is =
over
he may look like a pancake =96 squeezed by Wall Street on the one side, and=
 by his
Tea Party crew on the other.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=
size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is likely that
whatever deal to avoid default ultimately emerges from the Biden talks, wil=
l
ultimately pass with more Democratic than Republicans votes in both houses.=
&nbsp; That means that the deal cannot contain
poison pill proposals that are completely unacceptable to most mainstream
Democrats.&nbsp; But that, in turn, may very
well be unacceptable to the right-wing ideologues who see the debt-ceiling =
vote
as their one chance to make big changes in the federal budget.<o:p></o:p></=
span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Boehner allows a vote on such a
proposal =96 and it does indeed pass with more Democrats than Republicans =
=96 he is
afraid there may be a mutiny and he may no longer swing the big House gavel
when the smoke clears.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This kind of
division massively weakens the Republican=92s bargaining position.&nbsp; As=
 the prospect of default barrels toward us,
looming larger and larger in the weeks ahead, the pressure from the Wall
Street/CEO gang will grown unbearable.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=
size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></o:p></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact of the
matter is that the Party=92s big dogs will not allow Boehner to pull the pl=
ug on
the grenade that sends the economy back into a major recession and causes m=
arkets
to plummet.&nbsp; And of course, if they did,
the political consequences for the GOP in 2012 would be catastrophic. <o:p>=
</o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
 medium;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had the
Republicans simply continued to scream about deficits (as hypocritical as t=
hat
may seem) they would have had a much stronger hand. Instead they handed
Democrats a politically iconic example of exactly what the world would be l=
ike
if they had their way =96 abolishing Medicare.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><o:p><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=

<p class=3D"MsoNormal"><span class=3D"Apple-style-span" style=3D"font-size:=
