Dear John,

It's a heinous disregard for the health and well-being of women, and yet Speaker Boehner is making the bill to reduce access to reproductive services one of his "top legislative priorities."
 
*Could it be that the Republicans are so out of touch with what Americans want and need? Or are they making a conscious choice to pander to their extremist fringe in hopes of making electoral gains?*
 
Whatever they might be thinking, it's not going to work. The majority of Americans will not support limiting access to health care, taxing women who want a full range of reproductive services, and intruding on our personal and private decisions.
 
But the only way the Republicans are going to figure that out is if we tell them-right now. *Join me, Senator Boxer and the tens of thousands of Americans who are saying enough is enough.*
 
*Click here to sign our petition and join the rising chorus of thousands of Americans demanding this bill be stopped.* [ http://www.stophr3.com/?source=keg ]
 
Focusing all this energy and attention on such an egregious bill is like adding insult to injury. Not only are the Republicans willfully ignoring the very real needs of Americans for more jobs and more relief from this relentless economic downturn, they're actually trying to take away rights and freedoms we've come to depend on.
 
*Speaker Boehner and his colleagues in the House need to understand that if they insist on moving forward with a bill that discriminates against 51 percent of Americans,* they're in for the fight of their lives. 
 
*Tens of thousands of people nationwide have already joined Senator Boxer and me in speaking out against this attack on women's health. *What's missing is you. By adding your name to this petition you'll be taking us one step closer to defeating this outrageous bill and forcing the House to deal with the real problems facing Americans.
 
*Click here to make your voice heard and tell Speaker Boehner and the Republicans that they need to focus on adding jobs, not taking away rights.* [ http://www.stophr3.com/?source=keg ] 
 
Yes, the response against this bill has been impressive. But it's still not enough. Join us today and help us reach a critical mass that will finally put an end to this disastrous legislation.

Sincerely,
 
Kirsten Gillibrand
