Here is some additional background too on why I was requesting a separate
labor call....

1.  Give John a opportunity to say thank you directly to national labor
political directors for Iowa.  There are exit polls showing that their work
made a (the) difference.  21% of union householders made up the Iowa
electorate, and they voted for HRC over Sanders by 9 points.  If the voter
did not come from a union household, HRC beat Sanders by 1 point.  This is
big deal, and demonstrates their program.

2.  I have A LOT of NH asks for labor.  I can walk thru those and having
John on the call helps give the call muscle and urgency.

Both of these things would be really helpful and is the reasoning for my
separate call ask.

Let me know what you think!  Thanks!!!
