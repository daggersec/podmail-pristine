Friend,

Since Terry's email, I've been monitoring our progress and I
wanted to let you know that we're just $5,219 away from
reaching our grassroots fundraising goal.

We simply can't afford to fall short now -- we're so close.
If we can get there by the deadline, we'll have the
resources to fight back against the Tea Party and the smear
campaign they're running against Terry.

Will you make a $5 donation before midnight?

Thanks for standing with us,

Today's the last day before we have to submit our first
financial report of the year -- our biggest test so far.

This is our best opportunity to demonstrate the strength of
our grassroots movement to the press and political pundits
in Richmond. And if we succeed, there will be no doubt that
we have the resources -- both people-powered and financially
-- to win this election.

But we're still $14,817 away from our online fundraising
goal and the deadline is at midnight. Can you make a
$5 donation right now?

This has been a big week. Not only is our financial report
due after tonight, I also submitted 35,000 signatures to the
Virginia Board of Elections -- 350 percent more than is
required -- securing my place on the ballot this November. I
have to thank the 500+ people across the Commonwealth who
volunteered their time and made this possible.

It's unmistakable: there is significant momentum building
around this campaign.

But we can't stop there. Recent polls show that this race is
incredibly close, and even a momentary lapse in our efforts
could be disastrous.

Will you make sure we reach our fundraising goal by making a
$5 donation before midnight?

Happy Easter and thank you for taking a moment out of your
holiday to help out,

Terry
