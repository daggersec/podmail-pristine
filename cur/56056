Thanks.  We put an offer out yesterday to a candidate we are very excited a=
bout.  If that does not work out for any reason I'll definitely bring Sarah=
 in for an interview.

Hi John. I hate to be the friend who only gets in touch when (s)he has a qu=
estion or request.  This time I'm doing it from Rancho LaPuerta in Mexico (=
which you know from your brother if not your own experience.) And I'm sure =
u will understand why I'm doing both. Susan and John's daughter Sarah is a =
talented lawyer and spectacular person, returning to work and very interest=
ed in a position that was posted by CAP.  Per below, she's not heard back f=
rom anyone.  Helping Sarah get access is what we do for the kids of our fri=
ends, especially in this case since is would be a coup for CAP.

Your advice on this?  (Won't ask what u are advising HRC on TPP -- a rock a=
nd a hard place as well as d=E9j=E0 vu.)

Appreciation and love,
Phyllis

Hi Phyllis,

I am reaching out as I have not yet heard from CAP on the legal job, and I =
would love to take you up on your offer to reach out to John Podesta.  As y=
ou may remember from our conversation, I originally applied for a legal cou=
nsel position but subsequently learned that the deputy general counsel posi=
tion was opening up (the deputy moved to the general counsel role).  I do t=
hink the deputy general counsel position would be a better fit given my exp=
erience, and I'd like to pursue that opening (although it is not yet advert=
ised on CAP's job board).   I have attached the resume that I submitted wit=
h my application, but please let me know if there is anything else  that wo=
uld be helpful.

All the best,
Sarah O.
