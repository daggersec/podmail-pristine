Dear John,

Have you seen them? They're everywhere.

Republican interests have been swarming our state for months, but with your help, we've been able to push back. Just yesterday, Republican heavyweight George Pataki announced that he's not getting in the race.

But, we can't get too comfortable. Candidates like David Malpass (who has already committed $1 million of his own money into the primary alone) pose a real threat. We need to keep focused.

Because supporters like you are the most important part of our campaign, we want to make sure you are kept up to date with all of the latest information. Here are some of the latest developments you may have missed.

Sincerely,
Ross Offinger

Major Triumph

Last week, Kirsten asked for your help. GOP leaders in the Senate were blocking unemployment benefits that thousands of New Yorkers were counting on. Thousands of grassroots supporters like you, joined Kirsten to call for an end to this obstruction. The message was received. Just yesterday the Senate moved forward on this key legislation to extend benefits to Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Not only was this the right thing for New York and American families, it was the right thing for our economy. 

Traveling the state

This month Kirsten was endorsed by 60 of all 62 Democratic county chairs in the state!  This weekend alone she's spending time in New York City, Long Island, Albany, and Syracuse. She's also looking forward to her trip later this month to Rochester, Central New York, and all through the Lower Hudson Valley.

On the ground

Kirsten once told me that campaigns are won and lost, not on the airwaves, but on the phones and at the doors. That is why she is storming the state, recruiting volunteers, earning endorsements, and building one of the most aggressive grassroots campaigns in New York history.  

Every week volunteers around the state are using their free time to talk to their friends, neighbors, and community members about Kirsten's work to help the unemployed and her bold ideas to make government more effective. We're counting on passionate, informed grassroots supporters just like you to spread our message.

Moms For Kirsten

This month hundreds of moms across New York came forward and launched their own effort to raise awareness about Kirsten and her positive agenda. They are recruiting thousands of "Moms For Kirsten". From ensuring drinking water is clean for our kids and baby products are safe and chemical-free to helping more college students get Pell grants or allowing college graduates to remain on their parents' health insurance, Kirsten has produced results for Moms (and Dads) across New York. It is time to let all New Yorkers know about it.
