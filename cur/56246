Herb -- don't know if you have seen these stories but if they are true
Geithner and Obama are going to end up being the ultimate losers.   Hope
you can find a way to help Sheila.

Geithner May Seek to Push Bair Out After Clashes During Crisis=20

=20

Dec. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Timothy Geithner, President-elect Barack Obama's
choice for U.S. Treasury Secretary, is seeking to push Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair out of office.=20

=20

Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has argued
Bair isn't a team player and is too focused on protecting her agency
rather than the financial system as a whole, according to two
congressional officials and a person familiar with his thinking. Bair
has battled with Geithner and fellow regulators over aid to Citigroup
Inc. and other emergency actions, making her enemies in the Bush
administration.=20

=20

"The idea of having an independent actor on the stage with you who might
not be singing the same tune can make you nervous," said Wayne
Abernathy, a former Treasury official who is now executive vice
president with the American Bankers Association in Washington. "They
recognize that she's a very independent person."=20

=20

It isn't clear that Obama would ask Bair to step down. Such a move would
be fraught with political risk for the new administration, especially on
Capitol Hill, where Bair's campaign to rework mortgages for struggling
homeowners has won respect from top lawmakers, including Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd and Barney Frank, his counterpart in
the House.=20

=20

Bair's spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment. Obama's transition
spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter had no immediate comment.=20

=20

Obama Plan=20

=20

Even if Bair remains at the FDIC, the Obama economic team has decided
that she won't play a central role in policy, the people said. While
Bair, like Obama, has favored aid for Main Street as well as Wall
Street, the new administration will have its own plan to help the
millions of people facing eviction from their homes. It will also have
its own team to run the government's $700 billion bailout program, they
added.=20

=20

Pushing out the head of the FDIC, which oversees more than 5,000 banks
and savings institutions, would clash with the pledges made by Obama's
own transition team. Bair has become the most prominent Republican
regulator, and the incoming administration has promised to give
Republicans important jobs.=20

=20

"You'll see Republicans again, in his administration, not just a token
member in the Cabinet, but you'll see them spread throughout the
administration," transition director John Podesta said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television last week.=20

=20

Frank Proposal=20

=20

Bair, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to a term as
chairman that ends in 2011, has been lobbying behind the scenes for a
stepped-up role in the Obama administration. Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat, has suggested that she be named to a special post to oversee
government-wide programs to stop foreclosures.=20

=20

Bair "brings a lot of credibility" on crafting ideas to ease the
mortgage crisis, said Kevin Petrasic, a former Office of Thrift
Supervision official who now works at law firm Paul, Hastings, Janofsky
& Walker in Washington.=20

=20

In public comments, Bair, 54, has indicated she'd like to stay on, while
she'd be prepared to depart if Obama wants someone else to take the helm
at the FDIC.=20

=20

She said at a press conference in Washington Nov. 25 she'd work "in
whatever role they want me in this institution to play." The month
before, Bair said in an interview on "Political Capital with Al Hunt" on
Bloomberg Television that "I'm happy to go back to academia too. So I
want to be flexible for the next president."=20

=20

Protecting Fund=20

=20

Geithner became increasingly wary of Bair as she worked with the other
regulatory agencies on emergency bailouts of banks in recent months. The
New York fed chief has been concerned that Bair was more worried about
keeping the FDIC's insurance program protected than she was about the
entire financial system, one person said.=20

=20

Bair twice sparred with her colleagues at the Fed and Treasury over
efforts involving Citigroup. In October, she acquiesced to Wachovia
Corp.'s agreement to a takeover by Wells Fargo & Co. days after agreeing
to back an initial deal with Citigroup. Geithner was concerned that
allowing the Citigroup transaction to fail would inhibit other lenders
from working with the FDIC on any subsequent rescues, the people said.=20

=20

Wells Fargo offered about $15 billion for Wachovia, compared with
Citigroup's $2.2 billion deal to acquire Wachovia's banking operations,
and didn't need any FDIC aid.=20

=20

Citigroup Crisis=20

=20

Citigroup's position weakened, with its shares losing as much as 65
percent after the failed Wachovia deal amid a collapse in investor
confidence -- precipitating another rescue attempt.=20

=20

Again, Bair held out for concessions as the Fed and Treasury sought to
shield Citigroup from losses in its holdings of toxic assets. Bair
insisted on getting preferred shares for the FDIC in the New York-based
bank. She also demanded that Citigroup agree to implement mortgage
modifications according to a model developed by her agency.=20

=20

At one point during a Nov. 23 Fed board meeting about the Citigroup
rescue, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke stepped out to take a call from
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. Returning a few moments later,
Bernanke told his colleagues that the secretary was still locked in
negotiations with Bair, whose demands were delaying the deal.=20

=20

The political peril of ousting a popular regulator who has sided with
struggling homeowners and sought tougher conditions on financial firms
could fuel charges that Geithner and other Obama appointees are too
closely connected to Wall Street.=20

=20

'Willing to Stand Up'=20

=20

"I don't think you want an FDIC chairman who isn't willing to stand up,"
former FDIC Chairman William Isaac, who is now head of Secura Group LLC
in Falls Church, Virginia, said in an interview.=20

=20

On other issues, too, Bair has stepped out in front of her Bush
administration colleagues.=20

As the mortgage bust deepened, Bair repeatedly pushed Fed and Treasury
officials to boost aid for homeowners.=20

=20

In 2007, Bair told lawmakers the Fed should use its authority over
home-loan standards to tighten oversight and crack down on the practices
that contributed to the subprime mortgage mess.=20

=20

This year, Bair has proposed using taxpayer funds to help refinance
loans for struggling homeowners. She told legislators at an Oct. 23
hearing that the Treasury could use its $700 billion financial-rescue
fund to set terms for mortgage modifications and offer guarantees for
loans that meet the standards.=20

=20

Senators pressed Neel Kashkari, the Treasury official overseeing the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, on his department's reaction. "We are
looking very hard" on the proposal, he said.=20

=20

The White House later that month sought to scale back Bair's idea to use
as much as $50 billion from the program. Yesterday, an official said
Paulson instead is considering a proposal to drive down home-loan rates
through purchases of mortgage-backed securities.=20

Geithner's Rise Clouds Bair's Prospects=20


By DAMIAN PALETTA
<http://online.wsj.com/search/search_center.html?KEYWORDS=3DDAMIAN+PALETT=
A
&ARTICLESEARCHQUERY_PARSER=3DbylineAND>=20


WASHINGTON -- Timothy Geithner's nomination as Treasury secretary clouds
the political future of Sheila Bair, the high-profile bank regulator who
has clashed occasionally with Mr. Geithner over the best way to
stabilize the banking sector.

The most recent run-in came this weekend, when the government scrambled
to prevent the collapse of Citigroup
<http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=3Ddjn&symbol=3Dc>  =
Inc.
Mr. Geithner helped lead talks that eventually set up a process for the
government to backstop a $306 billion portfolio of assets at Citigroup.
Ms. Bair pushed back repeatedly during the talks after some government
officials had suggested her agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
offer the brunt of the government's guarantee, people familiar with the
deliberations said.

Timothy Geithner

Although it isn't clear which policy Mr. Geithner was advocating, he
sought to steer the talks to a rapid conclusion, despite Ms. Bair's
objections, emphasizing that a quick resolution was the most important
concern. Eventually, government officials hashed out a compromise that
limited the FDIC's exposure, but only after the emotional debates
stretched late into Sunday evening.

The episode was illustrative of how two of the country's most powerful
regulators have addressed the banking crisis from different
perspectives. They have, on more than one occasion, tangled over how
much her agency should shoulder the burden of backstopping problems in
the banking system.

As head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Geithner is the
Fed's eyes and ears on Wall Street. As Barack Obama's Treasury
secretary, he would have even broader powers and play an instrumental
role in redesigning the fractured U.S. regulatory system.

Ms. Bair's agency has wide powers, but she has resisted calls by the Fed
and Treasury to broaden the FDIC's exposure to troubled parts of the
banking system -- changes she fears could cost her agency billions of
dollars. The FDIC is best known for its role covering deposits at some
8,500 banks and thrifts. Ms. Bair has expressed concern that expanding
its responsibilities might lead to new costs on insured banks, which
fund the government insurance plan with fees.

Sheila Bair

Both Ms. Bair and Mr. Geithner are hard-charging personalities who
convey a calm public persona, yet can be assertive and intense during
negotiations.

If confirmed as head of Treasury, Mr. Geithner could have a big say over
whether Ms. Bair, a Republican, is asked to continue at the FDIC, take
on another role in the administration, or leave altogether. Ms. Bair,
whose term ends in 2011, told reporters Tuesday that she is "quite
content" at the FDIC and would "work with the new administration in
whatever role they want me."

But people close to Ms. Bair said she would only stay at the agency if
she felt she was wanted there and wouldn't stand in the way of letting
the new administration craft its own team. Still, pushing her out would
be politically risky. Ms. Bair is well-liked by many on Capitol Hill --
both Democrats and Republicans -- who view her as one of the
government's most proactive officials when it comes to preventing
foreclosures. She also has won over consumer groups and community
bankers, which could make her politically untouchable. But her repeated
clashes with the Treasury and occasionally with top Fed officials have
led to criticism that she is difficult to negotiate with.

Mr. Geithner, through a spokesman at the New York Fed, declined to
comment.

Officials from the Obama administration's transition team have met with
FDIC officials to review the agency's operations, but they haven't made
any public statements about Ms. Bair's eventual role. Her agency is
facing a difficult stretch, and she said Tuesday that there now are 171
banks and thrifts on the FDIC's "problem" list, which means they are at
a greater risk of failing. That is up from 117 firms at the end of the
second quarter.

Their dispute over Citigroup came roughly a month after Ms. Bair and Mr.
Geithner clashed over the size and scope of a new and controversial
program that uses the FDIC to guarantee certain new debt issued by banks
through June 2009. Mr. Geithner, along with Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, wanted the debt guarantee to be
broader, people familiar with the matter said, as they felt this was
necessary to restore confidence in U.S. banks. Ms. Bair sought a more
limited guarantee and questioned whether it was legal for her agency to
guarantee debt issued by bank parent companies.

As with the Citigroup debate, government officials eventually reached a
compromise scaling back the level of guarantees sought by the other
regulators.

Mr. Geithner and Ms. Bair also clashed over whether regulators should
block Wells Fargo
<http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=3Ddjn&symbol=3Dwfc>  =
&
Co.'s bid to acquire Wachovia Corp. shortly after the government had
offered Citigroup financial backing to do the deal, according to people
involved in the process.

close to Ms.
Bair said she would only stay at the agency if she felt she was wanted =
there

well-liked
by many on Capitol Hill -- both Democrats and Republicans -- who view =
her as
one of the government's most proactive officials when it comes to =
preventing
foreclosures. She also has won over consumer groups and community =
bankers,
which could make her politically untouchable. But her repeated clashes =
with the
Treasury and occasionally with top Fed officials have led to criticism =

said
Tuesday that there now are 171 banks and thrifts on the FDIC's

Geithner,
along with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben =
