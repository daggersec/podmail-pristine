Just circling back...so you didn't want to mention the Big Three bargaining
at all?  Just flagging again.

And the paragraph:

=C2=B7        *Worker bargaining power is vital to raising incomes.  *The
pressure and intimidation we saw against UAW organizing in Tennessee was
outrageous.  Governors like Rick Snyder and Scott Walker have stomped on
workers=E2=80=99 rights. I was an original co-sponsor of the Employee Free =

*Could we say:  And anti-union Governors like Rick Snyder and Scott Walker
have stomped on workers' rights by signing Right to Work legislation into
law.  *
