could California become involved in some kind of class action against  most 
egregious predatory mortgage lenders, a surcharge for our deficit, or claw  
back money they made hand over fist at front end of selling sub prime 
mortgages  to people with clearly insufficient or even no incomes.  These 
practices  poisoned state revenues didn't they?  Could fines or class action awards 
go  bake to states. Just outside the box idea/question for legal minds.   
Thanks.
