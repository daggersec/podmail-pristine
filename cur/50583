Ditto. We are extremely lucky to have Wally, not only on this project, and =
the building of the law center, but as a colleague and contributor to Geore=

Wally:

You are our secret weapon in navigating so many years of construction.  In =
the early days you and Dick Chused were the law professor/architects. Your =
book, Construction Notes, will be an indispensable part of the law school h=
istory.

I thank you for this important contribution.

Dear Wally, Thank you for your active engagement with this construction pro=
ject. Your involvement is a major reason why, "Despite the enormity of the =
project, our lives have been, for the most part, minimally disrupted."  As =
the year draws to a close, I would like to express my gratitude on behalf o=
f the entire community.

Thank you, as well, for these Construction Notes. Among your countless gift=
s, you are a skilled urban historian, and it is fascinating to read an acco=
unt like this.

Best, Bill

Dear colleagues,

            As the rhythms of our academic year wind down, we at the Law Ce=
nter will take the time to recognize and celebrate all of our students=92 a=
ccomplishments. Graduation brings excitement and anticipation. It gives us =
one last chance to recognize our students=92 hard work and achievements and=
 to wish them well as they take the knowledge and values we hope to instill=
 into the next phase of their lives. It also signals the start of a little =
respite before we begin to prepare for another academic year.

The BBC construction team will not experience that respite since their work=
 will continue unabated; and as you can see as you walk down 2nd Street, it=
 continues at a dazzling pace. If they stopped for a moment, however, they =
too would see much to celebrate. Excavation is reaching deep into the earth=
, and soon it will reach the highway surface. Much of the 128,000 feet of t=
imber that makes up the lagging boards are set in place. Concrete barriers =
down on the highway are crumbling with great speed under the power of hoe r=
ams, and the retaining walls that define the highway=92s 2nd Street exit ra=
mp are nearly demolished. What has amazed me most is how we were able to in=
tegrate our academic rhythms with the architectural and engineering rhythms=
 of this massive and extraordinary construction project. Despite the enormi=
ty of the project, our lives have been, for the most part, minimally disrup=
ted. There was almost no noise filtering into the classrooms during final e=
xaminations. When the sounds did erupt a little louder than we had hoped, B=
BC shut down the operation so that the students would not lose focus or con=
centration as they completed their tests. So as I send my shout out to our =
graduates as they begin their legal careers, I am also sending one to BBC a=
nd PGP Partners for making my life as Law Center liaison to the project a l=
ittle easier than I had expected.

formally break ground for the project this past Tuesday. It may seem strang=
e to break ground now given all of the work we have witnessed; but what we =
have been watching are only the preparations for the actual construction of=
 the deck and the buildings that will stand upon it. If you want to view a =
new video that shows the completed project, you can access it at http://cap=
itolcrossingdc.com/#asset-library/video

            But before we move into the future, I thought I would end the s=
chool year by finishing the story I began in my last Construction Note abou=
t the people who lived here before we arrived. By 1923, this area was compl=
etely developed. Small factories, hotels, apartment buildings, and flat-fro=
nt houses stood side by side in this multicultural working-class neighborho=
od. Looking at the neighborhood now, one can hardly believe that this was a=
 thriving residential area, teeming with small businesses. Vaccaro=92s Ital=
ian Delicatessen and Bakery was located at 3rd Street and Massachusetts Ave=
nue, NW, and survived there until it moved in the 1970s. It served some of =
the best cannoli in the city. (I know that since I ate them myself when I a=
ttended Georgetown when it was still located at 506 E Street, NW.) Each mor=
ning, trucks laden with bread left the Holmes Bakery with their morning del=
iveries. The Holmes Bakery was owned by relatives of retired Law Center Pro=
fessor Jack Murphy. Holmes stood about where the new Sport and Fitness Cent=
er stands. During the excavation of our site, we found remnants of the old =
Madison Alley that connected 1st and 2nd Streets, NW, and which provided th=
e exit route for the Holmes drivers. Viareggio=92s Grocery Store stood at 3=
rd and I Streets, NW. My wife=92s relatives once ran a grocery store on 1st=
 and E Streets, NW, just south of the Law Center campus. Until recently, on=
e of the few

<image002.jpg>

300 Third Street NW

remaining examples of the area=92s residential architecture stood on E Stre=
et between 1st and 2nd Streets, NW -- a vacant and a silent reminder of the=
 laughing children and struggling families who lived here in another time. =
Our daycare center playground now occupies that land, bringing back joyous =
shouts and laughter for us to treasure as we go about our daily business. A=
 few other such houses still stand north of Massachusetts Avenue but all of=
 them will soon be gone as the now fashionable and hip NOMA neighborhood co=
ntinues to develop.

4th and G Streets NW

Life, however, was not always rosy. The East End and the former neighborhoo=
d just to the north, sometimes called Northwest 1, were populated mostly by=
 working-class African Americans and European immigrants. The people of thi=
s neighborhood were a m=E9lange of nationalities, with the Irish, English, =
German, Swedes, Italians, and Eastern European Jews mixing relatively peace=
fully with African Americans -- at least until the 1950s. Although wealthy =
and prominent people like Stephen Douglas, Ulysses Grant, and William Tecum=
seh Sherman once lived near 2nd and I Streets, NW, the area never became fa=
shionable. As the grip of segregation tightened in Washington after 1870, t=
he few wealthy citizens in our neighborhood moved farther into the northwes=
t sections of the city. The people who remained often struggled economicall=
y and socially, with help coming primarily from the area churches.

            Residential neighborhoods north of Massachusetts Avenue deterio=
rated in the era between 1890 and 1950.  Referring to that era and that nei=
ghborhood, local newspapers described a =93half-century of decay and neglec=
t=94 producing =93slums, crime, and degradation.=94  They called the neighb=
orhood a =93menace =96 the veritable sink of iniquity.=94  The area around =
Holy Rosary parish avoided much of this desolation until after World War II=
, but the Northwest 1 neighborhood across Massachusetts Avenue suffered gre=
atly throughout the era. Racism and the depressions of the late 1870s, the =
early 1890s, and the 1930s exacerbated the misery of the people living ther=
e.  Moreover, restrictive real estate covenants forced the increasing numbe=
r of African Americans coming to the area from the South to live in already=
 overcrowded and substandard housing. Although new employment opportunities=
 were created during World Wars I and II, African Americans usually had acc=
ess only to the lower-paying positions. As those jobs were filled, the new =
residents streaming in from the South had few options.

            The infamous 2nd police district, stretching from Massachusetts=
 Avenue to Florida Avenue and from Union Station to 14th Street, NW, was a =
neighborhood of =93rotting hovels, rusted tin fences, and littered yards.=
=94  Called the =93Sinful Second=94 or the =93Wickedest Precinct,=94 it hou=
sed the worst slums in Washington, D.C.  Flats and tenements were built =93=
side by side and back to back.=94  It was an area where =93sunlight was a s=
tranger.=94 As late as 1950, one-half of the houses were dilapidated, witho=
ut plumbing, and without adequate heat or light. People in the area often l=
ived six to a room. Housing codes were seldom enforced, either out of pity =
for the residents who had nowhere else to go or because graft lined the poc=
kets of the enforcers. Social services, then as now, were under-funded and =
poorly staffed. Every other child in the area was considered illegitimate u=
nder the laws of that day, and the tuberculosis and alcoholism rates were t=
he highest in the city.

ough the precinct=92s 1953 crime rate of nineteen murders, 269 robberies an=
d 714 house breakings seems low today, it was a scandal for that era. The p=
olice call box at 6 =BD and N Streets, NW, was the busiest box in the city.

            The reasons for this slide within this otherwise thriving inter=
national city were as common then as they are today. Budget strangulation b=
y a Congress unwilling to appropriate an adequate federal payment, the lack=
 of meaningful home rule, and the pervasiveness of racism in an essentially=
 Southern city virtually guaranteed the result. Moreover, the post-World Wa=
r II boom spurred on by the GI Bill and housing policies that benefited whi=
tes more than African Americans resulted in the flight of middle class whit=
e families from the city to the suburbs. Even after attorney Ralph Urciolo,=
 a Holy Rosary parishioner, teamed with legendary African-American lawyer C=
harles Houston to attack restrictive housing covenants in the D.C. courts, =
city planners were still looking for ways to keep neighborhoods segregated.=
 Urciolo and Houston eventually prevailed when the Supreme Court declared r=
estrictive covenants unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a case with wh=
ich theirs was joined for Court consideration. 334 U.S. 1 (1948). Nonethele=
ss, their victory had little immediate effect on segregation in the city. T=
he federal committees that ruled Washington, D.C., were often led by Congre=
ssmen from Southern states who found little political advantage in ameliora=
ting the causes of poverty, especially since the urban poverty in Washingto=
n affected citizens who did not look like the voters in the Congressmen=92s=
 hometowns. By the mid-1950s, the combination of these policies and practic=
es had devastated Northwest 1 and the devastation began to spill over into =
the East End.

            Calls for urban renewal to relieve the plight of those living i=
n poverty began in the late 1940s and came to fruition in the late 1950s an=
d early 1960s. Plans were made to build new parks, improve commercial areas=
, and close the dangerous streets and alleys. North Capitol Street was to b=
ecome a =93dignified and beautiful=94 approach to the Capitol. But the earl=
y plans issued by Ulysses S. Grant III, grandson of the hero of the Civil W=
ar, also reinforced the practice of segregated housing. The first D.C. urba=
n renewal site was the old Southwest neighborhood, a small enclave of mostl=
y black and some poor white residents living between the Potomac and Anacos=
tia Rivers and Independence Avenue.  The plan called for the complete destr=
uction of the neighborhood and the permanent relocation of its residents to=
 the other side of the Anacostia River. By the time the bulldozers were thr=
ough, there was nothing left of the old neighborhood. Parts of that neighbo=
rhood, between the Nationals ballpark to the Maine Avenue Wharf, is again u=
ndergoing a renewal.

         The Evening Star, Dec 3, 1916.

The total devastation of Southwest produced calls for something different i=
n the Northwest Urban Renewal District. The original plan for the 2nd preci=
nct called for razing all 16,000 houses and relocating the 60,000 people wh=
o lived there. Neighborhood outcries produced new plans, intense debates, a=
nd more new plans and challenges. The City issued =93raze or repair=94 orde=
rs against many dwellings hoping to force some resolution of the issue. Ult=
imately, most of the early urban renewal plans were abandoned. During the p=
ast forty years, housing policies changed and new residents moved into the =
area. Today, homes in the 2nd precinct=92s Shaw and Logan Circle neighborho=
ods, once called =93rotting hovels,=94 now sell for more than a million dol=
lars.

            The final plan for Northwest 1, an area within the larger North=
west Urban Renewal tract bounded by Union Station to the east and I-395 to =
the west, and Massachusetts Avenue to the south and M Street to the north, =
called for the demolition of 1,011 homes and the displacement of over 7,000=
 people. Although some houses were rehabilitated, most were torn down. The =
few residents who remained could walk out their front door to a view of the=
 Capitol that was unimpeded by other buildings.

            Many buildings on the land Georgetown currently owns were also =
torn down. At one time the City planned to build a thirty-one-unit mobile h=
ome park on our McDonough Hall site, but I can find no evidence that the pl=
an was carried out.  Sometime later, a similar park for 225 units was plann=
ed along New Jersey Avenue between Prince and L Streets. Again, it is uncle=
ar whether the plan was carried out.

            Some hope actually emerged out of all this human and architectu=
ral desolation. Officials from Mt. Airy Baptist Church, Bible Way Church, a=
nd the Prince Hall Masons formed nonprofit organizations that built Sibley =
Plaza and Tyler House, two mid-rise apartment buildings on North Capitol St=
reet for low- and moderate-income families. The Golden Rule Apartments soon=
 followed. A group of Catholics from Gonzaga High School and St. Aloysius C=
hurch formed a nonprofit group to build a low- and moderate-income housing =
community called Sursum Corda, Latin for "lift up your hearts.=94 Built bet=
ween 1967 and 1969, the townhouses and apartments featured air conditioning=
, garbage disposals, and washers and dryers. The concept for these houses a=
nd apartments grew out of the socially progressive ideas of the 1960s and 1=
970s that demanded affordable, quality housing for poor residents who had b=
een displaced by urban renewal. A group of nuns moved into the neighborhood=
 to provide spiritual and temporal assistance to the residents. At the time=
, an editorial in the

<image008.jpg>                       <image009.jpg>

Washington Post lauded the architects for building =93a compact little vill=
age.=94

            But the hope generated by these projects soon turned to bittern=
ess. Urban renewal stalled, and white flight produced an even more segregat=
ed city. Instead of model communities, urban renewal had produced total dev=
astation in the Southwest Urban Renewal area and =93a low-income segregated=
 ghetto without adequate schools, shopping, or community facilities=94 in N=
orthwest 1.  Sursum Corda continued to suffer from the debilitating effects=
 of the well-intentioned but misguided and poorly planned efforts of the 19=
50s and 1960s. The last of the many nuns who once lived at Sursum Corda mov=
ed out when their home became a target for crime. Open air drug markets ope=
rated twenty-four hours a day. Today, however, developers are competing to =
buy the land, offering large sums of money, to the current owners.

The Italians of Holy Rosary Parish began to move to the suburbs, although t=
hey remained active in their church. The hotels near Union Station had long=
 lost their glory as airplanes replaced trains as the major form of transpo=
rtation. By 1965, the hotels had deteriorated into dingy waystations. Urban=
 renewal, once thought of as a cure for the city=92s poverty, had instead c=
reated an urban ghost town in the East End.

Between 1950 and 1970, the communities in our section of the East End were =
all swept away. Ill-managed urban renewal and a planned inner-city highway =
system had nearly destroyed L=92Enfant=92s dreams. It would take the foresi=
ght of Dean Paul Dean and his colleagues at Georgetown to begin the long, b=
ut now successful, rejuvenation of our neighborhood. When the Law Center be=
gan purchasing land in 1965, the area had become a wasteland. Few vestiges =
of a once-thriving neighborhood remained. No buildings stood on the McDonou=
gh Hall site. The Salvation Army, a Fish Fry carryout, and a few other smal=
l commercial buildings stood south of F Street where the Gewirz Residence H=
all now stands, and a few townhouses remained on the Williams Library site.=
 Most residences were vacant. To the west, land was being cleared for the C=
enter Leg Freeway. You may want to go back to the June 11, 2014, I-395 Cons=
truction Note to review how that highway got built. http://www.law.georgeto=
wn.edu/campus-services/facilities/construction-info/index.cfm

In 1971, Georgetown Law Center completed McDonough Hall and became the pion=
eer that brought life back to the area. By 2004, we had developed seven acr=
es of land and erected five buildings and an additional east wing to McDono=
ugh Hall. We assumed developers would follow us but none came for many year=
s. Slowly however, the area developed. First came the hotels, spurred on by=
 a renovation of Union Station. Then, new office spaces were built to house=
 those companies and associations that did  business with the Federal gover=
nment. Abe Pollin developed the Verizon Center which spurred the developmen=
t of apartment buildings along Massachusetts Avenue between Gallery Place a=
nd the Law Center and created the NOMA neighborhood. By 2004, the once-deso=
late East End was beginning to bustle with new life. Condominiums and apart=
ment buildings brought new residents while shops, restaurants, and theaters=
 re-establish the area as a commercial engine of the city. Nonetheless, Geo=
rgetown=92s campus, facing outward to the commercial nature of the area but=
 inward to our academic mission, was the jewel of our East End neighborhood=
.

Soon we will have a new jewel to join what we began; but much remains to be=
 done on the Capitol Crossing project. When you return in the Fall you will=
 see a much different site. Much of the utility work on the west side of th=
e highway along Massachusetts Avenue will have been completed. BBC will be =
installing caissons in the south block on the east shoulder of the site and=
 in the highway median of the north block to support the deck. A slurry wal=
l will be rising along the west shoulder of the north block for the same pu=
rpose. Excavation for the new exit ramp will be completed and the retaining=
 walls of the old exit ramp will almost all be demolished. Stay tuned, beca=
use all those stories will be told here another time.

As the academic year ends, I want to express my thanks for your cooperation=
 and patience during this project. I am sure that some of you, especially G=
ewirz residents, have endured some inconvenience this year. I still have ni=
ghtmares about water shutoffs! As I said when utility excavations began, Ca=
pitol Crossing is not a Georgetown project; but our concern for your safety=
 and your welfare remains paramount and we will remain vigilant as the proj=
ect continues. Fortunately, BBC Construction and PGP Developers have proved=
 to be good partners. Our neighborhood will be more exciting once the proje=
ct is completed, but all great things come with hard work and sacrifice. Th=
anks again for your patience and understanding.

I will continue to write these notes during the summer. For those of you wh=
o are graduating, send me your email address if you want to keep receiving =
them or visit our website where they are being stored. http://www.law.georg=
etown.edu/campus-services/facilities/construction-info/index.cfm I hope you=
 all have a great summer.
