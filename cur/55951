Scott Brown Denies Asserting That Obama Was Born Out Of Wedlock, Refuses To=
 Apologize

Earlier this weekend, David Kravitz of the blog BlueMassGroup uncovered a 2=
008 video of State Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA), the Republican candidate for U.=
S. Senate in Tuesday=92s special election, speculating that then-candidate =
Barack Obama was born out of wedlock. Today, ThinkProgress caught up with B=
rown to explain his comments, and asked if he would apologize for the accus=
ation:

    TP: You said that he, his mother wasn=92t married when [Obama] was born=
. You=92re not apologizing for that video?

    BROWN: Excuse me, now I wanna answer this question. I was asked whether=
 the president=92s parents were married. I said I didn=92t know. That was t=
he extent of the question.=20

But Brown was never asked about the marital status of Obama=92s parents. Du=
ring the 2008 video, Brown volunteered the assertion that Obama was born ou=
t of wedlock:

    BROWN: Barack=92s mom had him when she was what, 18 years old?

    GUEST: And married!

    BROWN: Well, I don=92t know about that. [laughing]
