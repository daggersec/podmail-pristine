 Flashback: McCain Praised Carter, Called Brzezinski An "Invaluable"
Adviser<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/11/flashback-mccain-praised_n_106518.html>

During an interview with NBC's Brian Williams
broadcast<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/vp/25066280#25066280>Monday
night, Sen. John McCain hit on an idea: if he had to be tied to an
unsuccessful president, so should Barack Obama.

Responding to a question about whether his candidacy would necessarily be
damaged by the suffering Republican brand, McCain responded, "Sen. Obama
says that I'm running for Bush's third term. It seems to me he's running for
Jimmy Carter's second."

Then he laughed at his own joke.

But what's truly funny about McCain's "Obama equals Carter" line is that the
Arizona Republican hasn't always been so down on the former president and
his team of advisers. In a May 1999 interview with The Hill newspaper, on
the occasion of his first presidential run, McCain was asked to opine on the
recent occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In his written reply, McCain
described Carter as having had "the greatest, the noblest and loftiest
intentions of any president, but he never really understood how to use the
institution to obtain his goals." In his brief response to the question,
McCain also said that while the Iranian hostage crisis "brought him down and
conveyed to the people he was a weak president. Whether he was or not,
that's [debatable]."

Still, the new gambit lives on, with McCain repeating it on Wednesday during
a CNBC interview. The line fits with the broader pattern of
guilt-by-association that the Republican presidential nominee's team has
been trying to make against Obama.

When Carter met with members of Hamas in May, McCain suggested Obama would
have to distance himself the former president or be implicated in kind.
(Even after Obama
criticized<http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/04/17/obama_attacks_carter_for_hamas_meeting/>Carter
and reiterated his objections to Hamas, though, McCain still used
Hamas's praise for Obama, since withdrawn, in a fundraising
appeal<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/18/mccain-hamas-endorsement_n_97469.html>
.)

As a writer for the Israeli daily newspaper Ha'aretz
editorialized<http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/976759.html>in
April:

"[McCain] wanted to say, here is an evil square: Iran-Hamas-Carter-Obama. He
also meant: If Obama is like Carter, the weak loser, then McCain is like
Reagan, his idol, and all that is left is to rerun the election results from
1980."

McCain's surrogates have also received the message loud and clear. Stu
Sandler, deputy executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition,
told<http://www.nationaljournal.com/congressdaily/cda_20080610_6017.php>the
National Journal that informal Obama adviser and former Carter
Natoinal
Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski could be used to stoke fears among
voters for whom Israel's security is a top concern.

The only problem on this count is that Brzezinski was one of McCain's
principal national security advisers during that inaugural 2000 run. Back
when McCain was a fearless critic of dogmatic Republican thinking, he
justified his hiring of Brzezinski as emblematic of his bipartisan streak.
As the Tuscon Citizen reported in January 2000:

"McCain added more global and military experience to his campaign by naming
a foreign policy team that includes advisers who have served under President
Carter, a Democrat, as well as under Republicans Richard Nixon, Ronald
Reagan and George Bush, the father of his chief rival for the GOP
nomination."

"I am honored that Zbigniew Brzezinski will join my foreign policy team,"
McCain said at that time. "As a former national security adviser and a
highly respected foreign policy expert, his broad experience makes him an
invaluable asset to my team." In describing his key advisers, McCain
continued: "I am very honored to have the support and advice of these
recognized experts whose years of service to our nation and experience in
international affairs have earned them the well-deserved respect of all."

So is Obama's respect for Carter aides like Zbigniew Brzezinski
"well-deserved" or a danger to the country? It all depends which John McCain
you ask.
