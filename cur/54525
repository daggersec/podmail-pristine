John,
 
First, congratulations!  What a remarkable era this can be.
I just got off the phone with Mike Lux, who called about possible plans for  
connecting the new Administration with its own volunteer organization, the  
DNC and existing groups.  He asked if I had an interest in a role  within this 
and I certainly would like to explore it.  I sent him a copy of  my resume and 
told him I'd also send you a note about the conversation.
 
Monday, Nov. 10, I am having some surgery (put off till after the election)  
that will have 2 - 4 weeks recovery.  After that I should be ready to  engage 
if there are useful ways to follow up.
 
Thanks for all you are doing,
Heather
