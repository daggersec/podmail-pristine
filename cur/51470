Hello everyone,

Last Friday, ABC News aired a segment on 20/20 challenging the intelligence
of America's young people, and consequently, their right to cast a ballot in
this year's election. *View the
segment.<http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=8694233&msgid=165889&act=PW1K&c=227168&admin=0&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dhvl0lqhCVio>
*

To quote our good friend Mike Connery (author of "Youth to Power"),

"There is a lot that is wrong with this piece. Yes, there are many
uninformed voters, but that category is not limited to young people, who are
unfortunately the main target of this piece. Anyone who has ever watched Jay
Leno could tell you that many Americans are uninformed about current events.
Unfortunately, some see that as an excuse to rob people of their
constitutional rights, and Stossel and ABC are happy to play along."

Voting is a gateway to a lifetime of civic education. If we discourage young
people from voting merely because we find their intelligence 'dim', then we
never offer the opportunity to learn the stakes and get involved. What Mr.
Bernstein didn't get to finish saying in his interview is that organizations
such as HeadCount equip young voters with nonpartisan voter guides that lay
all the issues on the table. Ask us to vote, and we'll want to know what's
at stake. Ask us to vote, and we'll want to learn more.

In response to this irresponsible segment, the Bus Project has put together
its own piece. Take a look, and pass it along to your friends. View the *Bus
Project's response
video.<http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=8694233&msgid=165889&act=PW1K&c=227168&admin=0&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8tsEUrEtzlQ>
*

 Help us reach our goal of educating 50,000 voters of all ages by donating
to the Bus's voter guide
fund<http://click.icptrack.com/icp/relay.php?r=8694233&msgid=165889&act=PW1K&c=227168&admin=0&destination=http%3A%2F%2Fbusproject.org%2Fvoter-guide-fund%2F>
.

Again, thanks for all you do!
