*PROGRESS MISSOURI LAUNCHED TO AMPLIFY PROGRESSIVE AGENDA IN MISSOURI*
*Missouri partner in a nation-wide network of progressive communication hub=
s
that promote economic and social justice*

Jefferson City, Mo. -- The newly-launched group *Progress Missouri* (
http://progressmissouri.org/) is a multi-issue progressive advocacy
organization that combines cutting edge online organizing and communication=
s
with rapid and hard-hitting on-the-ground strategies. Year round, Progress
Missouri will work to engage citizens from across the state around issues o=
f
immediate state or local concern.

Like other state partners of that national organization* ProgressNow *(
http://ProgressNow.org), Progress Missouri will focus on a broad progressiv=
e
agenda, working with allies to protect the middle class, fight economic and
social injustice, secure a clean energy future and serve as a counter-weigh=
t
to small-minded, extremist politicians.

=93Our goal is to provide a strong, credible voice for solutions to critica=
l
challenges facing Missouri's working families and communities,=94 said Sean
Soendker Nicholson, Executive Director of Progress Missouri. =93We'll also =
be
there to hold politicians accountable when they side with greedy CEOs and
their campaign checks over the needs of hard working Missourians."

A key component of Progress Missouri=92s work will be providing communicati=
ons
support for the entire progressive community in an effort to point out the
pitfalls of extreme conservative public policy. Local advocacy groups often
have little staff and fewer resources to ensure progressive perspectives ar=
e
heard in the media and around their community. With Progress Missouri's
help, their message will reach more Missourians.

During its initial launch, Progress Missouri is featuring action items for
those in the progressive community. The first calls on Missouri's
representatives in Washington to stand up against radical Medicare proposal=
s
that put health care for seniors at risk. The second demands that leaders i=
n
the Missouri General Assembly put aside their attacks on workers and focus
on real job creation and economic development legislation.

For further questions or inquiries, please contact Sean Soendker Nicholson
at 573-427-7326 or sean@progressmissouri.org.

Missourians can also connect with Progress Missouri at ProgressMissouri.org=
