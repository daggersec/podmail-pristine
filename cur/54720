We reached out to Heather as we were pulling together the working groups and
she was fine with the choices at that time.

&gt; There was some confusion as to whether the Biden Senate staff could join the<br>
&gt; transition in a role other than detailees. After talking to Bob, we&#39;ve<br>
&gt; concluded that the Obama and Biden staff can work on the transition and<br>
&gt; continue to be payed by the Senate as long as they have the permission of<br>
&gt; their boss and are working on issues related to their senate<br>
&gt; responsibilities. This was the working assumption for the Obama staff, and<br>
&gt; we have communicated this to the Biden staff.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Also, I need your input on staffing the team lead positions on the policy<br>
&gt; working groups post-election. Linda, Jeanne, Alex and Tino have all<br>
&gt; expressed an interest in continuing in their lead roles, but none are<br>
&gt; available to play their roles full time during the course of the transition.<br>
&gt; Between Alex and Tino, they can provide combined full-time coverage for the<br>
&gt; position, and it seems very natural to allow them to continue in their<br>
&gt; current role as co-leads. Jeanne can be in town on Wednesday, Thursday and<br>
&gt; Friday, but will be teaching in Austin on Monday and Tuesday. Sen. Daschle<br>
&gt; and Jeanne have recommended that Mark Childress cover the time that Jeanne<br>
&gt; isn&#39;t available, but he will need to deregister as a federally lobbyist<br>
&gt; before he can be identified in a lead role for the transition. Finally,<br>
&gt; Linda is available but can not do full-time duty. I propose that she split<br>
&gt; the lead role with Robert Gordon. One value in keeping our existing working<br>
&gt; group leads post-election is that none will require salaries for the<br>
&gt; transition, but there is a question as to whether we will pay for their<br>
&gt; travel related to their work for the transition.<br>
