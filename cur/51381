<strong>--TRUMP TAKES IOWA:</strong> Republican presidential candidate Dona=
ld Trump is back on the campaign trail today and will hold an evening rally=
 in Dubuque. He's been taunting both fellow GOP candidtae <a href=3D"http:/=
/abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/jeb-bush.htm" id=3D"ramplink_Jeb Bush_" targ=
et=3D"_blank">Jeb Bush</a> and Fox News's Megyn Kelly on Twitter, <strong>A=
BC's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE</strong> notes. He also did some retweeting last nig=
ht, including one tweet in which a supporter called Kelly a "bimbo." Last n=
ight, Trump spoke to Fox News' Bill O'Reilly and said he would not host the=
 Chinese president if he was in the White House saying, "I'd get him a McDo=
nald's hamburger." He also called Jeb Bush a "nice person," but said he "do=
esn't have the energy or capacity to make our country great again!" </p>
<p>
<strong>--ANALYSIS -- ABC's RICK KLEIN:</strong> Inside Biden land, it's go=
ne from most likely 'no' to most likely 'yes.' But two big decisions loom. =
First is the vice president's, of course -- he's got to give the final word=
, and he hasn't yet. And then there's the president. Does President Obama g=
ive him his quiet acquiescence? Or does <a href=3D"http://abcnews.go.com/to=
pics/news/whitehouse/joe-biden.htm" id=3D"ramplink_Joe Biden_" target=3D"_b=
lank">Joe Biden</a> need more than that? It's hard to picture Biden challen=
ging for the nomination with an actual endorsement -- something that would =
open big donors' wallets, and provide a potential boost among Obama base vo=
ters (including African-Americans) in the primaries. It's an unimaginable c=
hoice for the president, notwithstanding the White House's insistence that =
choosing Biden as his running mate was his smartest ever political decision=
, leaving all other selections in second place or worse. Clearly, the vice =
president has earned the right to make this decision on his own. The presid=
ent's staff appears to be giving him the space to do just that. Yet that's =
different than the president himself getting on board.</p>
<p>
<strong>--KASICH SCORES HIGH-PROFILE ENDORSEMENT:</strong> The Kasich campa=
ign announced this morning that former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lo=
tt, R-Mississippi, has endorsed Kasich and will serve as a national co-chai=
r of his presidential campaign. Its Kasich's second major endorsement in as=
 many weeks; Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, endorsed the Ohio g=
overnor last week, <strong>ABC's BEN GITTLESON</strong> notes.</p>
<p>
<strong>--TODAY ON THE TRAIL with ABC's SHUSHANNAH WALSHE:</strong> Jeb Bus=
h is in Colorado today to hold a town hall on veterans' issues. <strong>Ran=

e primary candidates. <a href=3D"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/sarah=

praised him for coming yesterday, but she's not in town. <strong>Ted Cruz <=
/strong>is holding a conference call, reaching out to with pastors on the t=

<strong>THE BUZZ</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>with ABC's VERONICA STRACQUALURSI</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>JEB BUSH SAYS 'ANCHOR BABIES' COMMENT WAS 'MORE RELATED TO ASIANS.'=
 </strong>Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has ignited a firestor=
m once again -- saying his use of the controversial term "anchor babies" is=
 "more related to Asian people." Bush, who traveled to the U.S.-Mexico bord=
er Monday, has refused to back down from using the term, a derogatory phras=
e used to refer to the children of undocumented immigrants born on American=
 soil. Both he and Donald Trump have drawn fire for the usage, according to=
 <strong>ABC's CANDACE SMITH</strong>. At a campaign event in McAllen, Texa=
s yesterday, Bush was asked repeatedly by both the English and Spanish-lang=
uage press about his usage of the term "anchor babies" in a radio interview=
 last week. He has defended the term and tried to clarify Monday, saying th=
at it is "ludicrous" that anyone says his usage of "anchor babies" is derog=
atory. He also added that he was actually referring to the "birth tourism" =
industry. <a href=3D"http://abcn.ws/1MPBdJ8">http://abcn.ws/1MPBdJ8</a></p>
<p>
<strong>--WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING:</strong> "This latest comment from=
 Bush shows just how out of touch he is," said K.J. Bagchi, the DNC's Direc=
tor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Engagement. "The only thing wors=
e than Jeb Bush's words about immigrant families may be his policies toward=
s them."</p>
<p>
<strong>--WHAT THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF ASIAN-PACIFIC AMERICANS IS SAYING: <=
/strong>"From the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and legislative attempts to=
 overturn United States v. Wong Kim Ark to now calling us "anchor babies," =
Asian American and Pacific Islander communities continue to be discriminate=
d against as part of larger anti-immigrant rhetoric."</p>
<p>
<strong>HOW DRAFT BIDEN WANTS TO PAVE THE WAY FOR THE VP TO RUN IN 2016.</s=
trong> Vice President Joe Biden returned to work at the White House Monday =
as the political intrigue about whether he will pursue a 2016 bid mounts. W=
hile the VP makes up his mind, one group is paving the way for a potential =
Biden presidential campaign. The super PAC Draft Biden, which started as an=
 idea in March in the Chicago living room of 27-year-old William Pierce, no=
w the group's executive director, is ramping up its efforts in case the vic=
e president decides to make a third run for the White House. The group rece=
ived a major boost at the beginning of August when Josh Alcorn, a top strat=
egist for former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, joined the campaign =
as a senior adviser. "I think Joe Biden can win this presidential race," Al=
corn told <strong>ABC's JONATHAN KARL</strong>. "There's a real enthusiasm =
for a kind of candidate like him, somebody who can look somebody in the eye=
, connect with them on a very real level, tell them what he thinks the issu=
es facing the country are and then back his words up with actions." <a href=

<p>
<strong>OBAMA HASN'T RULED OUT ENDORSING BIDEN OR CLINTON.</strong> The ass=
umption is that President Obama will stay neutral if Joe Biden challenges H=
illary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primary. But that's not neces=
sarily so, the White House said Monday. "I wouldn't rule out the possibilit=
y of an endorsement in the Democratic primary," White House Press Secretary=
 Josh Earnest responded to a question posed by<strong> ABC's JONATHAN KARL<=
/strong> in a White House briefing. But how exactly the president would han=
dle a hypothetical Clinton-Biden contest remains an open question, <strong>=
ABC's JORDYN PHELPS</strong> writes. "There's not an insignificant 'if' in =
that question and that's what everybody is pretty interested to find out," =
Earnest said. "The president has indicated his view that the decision that =
he made seven years ago now to add Joe Biden to the ticket as his running m=
ate was the smartest decision he ever made in politics." <a href=3D"http://=

<strong>NOTED: IOWA DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR ON POTENTIAL BIDEN RUN.</strong>=
 Iowa Democratic Party Chair Dr. Andy McGuire says she has not talked to Bi=
den directly but has heard "rumblings." Asked if there was room for him in =
Iowa still, she said:  "Absolutely. There's always room for more." "We're s=
eeing great energy for candidates and the more people the better." Advice t=
o him? "If he's thinking about coming to Iowa, he should come. We'd love to=
 have him - love to have more candidates." But she added, "Earlier is bette=
r." She would not say when she thought was too late for the vice president =
to get in - but instead said she had talked to folks who are ready to be al=
l-in for him if he announces, <strong>ABC's MARYALICE PARKS </strong>report=

<strong>WALKER CAMPAIGN IN A WAR OF WORDS WITH DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN.</s=
trong> Wisconsin Democrat Rep. Gwen Moore says that Republican presidential=
 candidate and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is "tightening the noose, litera=
lly" around African-Americans, The Hill first reported Monday. Moore's comm=
ents, reportedly made during a phone call with reporters, came Monday as Wa=
lker was campaigning in South Carolina. Walker's press secretary AshLee Str=
ong has since called the comments "inflammatory and inappropriate" and says=
 that the governor "will continue to focus on presenting solutions for Amer=
icans and uniting the country, while others continue to create division," <=
strong>ABC's JORDYN PHELPS</strong> notes. The campaign has also used the c=
omments as an opening to gain support, tweeting out from Walker's official =
Twitter account "Don't let @RepGwenMoore's comments go unanswered," and pro=
viding a link for prospective supporters to sign a pledge supporting Walker=
's campaign for president.</p>
