Terry,
Secretary Chu called and asked me to raise the possibility with
President Clinton of his keynoting the DOE's ARPA-E Summitt on
February 29 or 28 in Washington DC.  29th is their preference. This is
the premier energy innovation conference sponsored by the Department
annually and could definitely be worth his time. High level of press
attention.  Didn't want to raise unless you thought it was plausible.
John
