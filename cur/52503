VIDEO: Watch Lieberman Endorse Medicare Buy-In Three Months Ago
<http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/health-care/video-watch-lieberman-end
orse-medicare-buy-in-three-months-ago/> 


Here's some video of Joe Lieberman
<http://theplumline.whorunsgov.com/health-care/video-watch-lieberman-end
orse-medicare-buy-in-three-months-ago/www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Joseph
_I._Lieberman>  only three months ago appearing to endorse the Medicare
buy-in idea - in seeming contradiction of his decision to bail on the
Senate deal.

Lieberman discussed the Medicare buy-in a meeting with the Connecticut
Post in September, according to an article in the paper at the time, as
TPM noted today
<http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/12/joe-lieberman-not-the-man-he
-used-to-be-on-medicare-buy-in.php?ref=fpblg> . But the article only
paraphrased Lieberman.

I asked the paper to send over the video, and it's worth watching,
because it gives you Lieberman's actual quotes - which seem at odds with
the Lieberman camp's claim today
<http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/1209/Lieberman_aide_pokes_leader
ship_leak_Selfserving.html>  that he has real problems with the
approach:

 In the vid, Lieberman appeared to go further than the current Senate
deal, which would expand Medicare to those aged 55-64, saying he
supported the idea of expanding it to people aged 50 and over. Lieberman
referenced his proposal along these lines during the 2006 campaign, and
added:

"My proposals were to basically expand the existing successful public
health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid... 

"When it came to Medicare I was very focused on a group - post 50, maybe
more like post 55. People who have retired early, or unfortunately have
been laid off early, who lose their health insurance and they're too
young to qualify for Medicare. 

"What I was proposing was that they have an option to buy into Medicare
early and again on the premise that that would be less expensive than
the enormous cost. If you're 55 or 60 and you're without health
insurance and you go in to try to buy it, because you're older ...
you're rated as a risk so you pay a lot of money."

It's not entirely clear that Lieberman was offering a full-throated
current endorsement of the proposal, but his tone is clearly positive
and approving. It's yet another sign, as if you needed one, that
Lieberman's current opposition to the Senate proposal doesn't appear to
have any roots in a genuine policy disagreement.
