Subject: What if it only results in a  little bit of institutionalization...

We know the companionship  exemption changes as proposed by the Department 
of Labor will result in the  institutionalization of people with 
disabilities.  ADAPT identified a  dozen ways this happens, but don't take our word for 
it.  The Department  of Labor said so themselves.



When we began to express concerns  that these federal policy changes would 
result in people being forced into  institutions, progressives defended the 
rules.  They highlighted how  states had already implemented these changes 
and there was no notable increase  in institutionalization.  But when you 
look a little closer, you find  that the states which have implemented these 
protections fit into a few  categories:

1. They formally exempt consumer-directed programs and  individual 
households;

2. They don't enforce their state rule on  consumers in consumer-directed 
programs; or

3. They don't offer a  significant number of hours in the first place.



Progressive  have since acknowledged that there may be "some" 
institutionalization, but it  won't be "significant" and certainly won't be "widespread". 
 What the  hell does that mean?  Is a limited amount of 
institutionalization  supposed to be acceptable?



To figure that out, we should  consider how other communities would respond 
if this were happening to  them.



If the Obama Administration were implementing a policy  that would result 
in "some" incarceration of innocent African Americans and  Latinos, but were 
assuring people that the number wouldn't be "significant"  much less 
"widespread", how would those communities  respond?



Outrage.

Pure unadulterated  outrage.



They would argue that it is NEVER acceptable for  law-abiding citizens to 
lose their freedom like that.  And they would be  right!



That's why the Obama Administration would never propose  such a policy, 
much less defend it.



And that's why if the  companionship rules are released without significant 
changes to address our  concerns, we need to express anger and outrage.  If 
people with  disabilities are going to lose their freedom and our 
attendants will lose  needed income, they should at least hear the rest of us crying 
out in anger  and expressing outrage at the injustice.



And if we are loud and  angry enough, we might even make things right.
