John, please let me know if you need additional info on this. Unless we make
a decision and finalize the document, we can't move forward in staffing the
transition and beginning the agency review process. Bob and I plan to talk
tomorrow morning at 10 ET on a range of legal issues, and we could resolve
this with the necessary feedback. Thanks, Cassandra
