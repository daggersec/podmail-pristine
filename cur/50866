Is there any reason not to push on the fact that McCain is joking about
killing the Iranian people? That doesn't seem very commander-in-chief-like
and I haven't heard any pushback on cable or in the papers about this gaffe.
I don't think the media would let anyone else off the hook quite so easily.

This 

In a brief question-and-answer session with reporters today, Republican
presidential nominee-apparent John McCain downplayed the signficance of
increasingly
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-07/09/content_8513324.htm>
assertive statements by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his
government indicating that the Iraqis will not agree to a security agreement
with the United States, unless it includes a specific timetable for the
withdrawal of U.S. troops. McCain told reporters his reaction was: 

"The same as it was when he said that they can't reach a status of forces
agreement. Prime Minister Maliki is the leader of a country and I'm
confident he will act as the President and the Foreign Minister both told me
in the last several days. It will be directly related to the situation on
the ground--just as they have always said. And since we are succeeding, I am
convinced, as I have said before, we will withdraw with honor, not according
to a set timetable, and I am confident that's what Prime Minister Maliki is
talking about. He has told me that in many meetings we have had."

I pressed McCain for an explanation of why Maliki would then be making these
comments, and asked whether this was perhaps for domestic political
consumption in advance of upcoming elections. With apparent pique, McCain
said:

"Why would be be saying a week or two ago, as you [in the media] so
effectively, escitedly reported, that the
<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121449696544507459.html?mod=googlenews_wsj>
status of forces agreement was dead? I don't know. You'll have to ask him.
But I know for a fact that it will be dictated by the situation on the
ground, as it always has been. And the situation on the ground ... is
successful. But it's fragile. I've always said it's fragile. So we will be
able to withdraw with honor. And I'm sure it will be dictated by the
situation on the ground. He doesn't want to give up these hard-won victories
in Basra and Mosul and Sadr City."

McCain was also asked about an Associated Press report indicating that
exports to Iran have increased largely on the basis of cigarette sales, to
which he quipped:

"Maybe that's a way of killing them."

From where I was standing in the pool, I could see that this remark drew a
nudge in McCain's back from his wife Cindy, at which point he hastened to
add that he was just kidding.
