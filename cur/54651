Dear John,

It's been a while so I wanted to update you on the race=2E We're very e=
xcited by the progress of the campaign and the grassroots momentum we'r=
e building to carry us over the top on April 26th=2E With fewer than 10=
0 days before early voting begins, the campaign is in high gear=2E Here=
 are some updates from the trail=2E


First, I'm very proud to announce our most recent endorsement by Bob Ro=
ss and June White Dillard: Two Giants in our community=2E

These two leaders are strong advocates for the criminal justice reforms=
 we pioneered together starting when I was State's Attorney=2E

Their endorsement speaks volumes about the success of our campaign in d=
eveloping deep relationships with grassroots leaders and activating the=
ir support=2E

We released our second Glenn on the Trail Video announcing our platform=
 to Fight Gun Violence=2E

I will continue to fight the NRA for common sense reforms that keep gun=
s out of the hands of dangerous people=2E

Click Here to Watch the Video Again: https://www=2Eyoutube=2Ecom/watch?=
v=3DGtUwIbsFEOo

We had a Meet and Greet to welcome a Minority Woman-owned Small Busines=
s to the district in Laurel: https://www=2Eyoutube=2Ecom/watch?v=3DrkTS=
nLQGP6o

Met many local business owners who are the engines of economic growth f=
or the district=2E

We also hosted a holiday gift drive organized by our volunteers for a w=
omen's homeless and domestic violence shelter=2E

Thank you to Women for Ivey and all those who contributed to the gift d=
rive and wrapping party=2E

Of course, we had our own holiday celebration with the family=2E

And yes, I fired up that grill for Christmas=2E

Recently, we released the following video in support of Obamacare in th=
e face of Republican efforts to repeal it again=2E

In Congress, I will preserve the accomplishments of President Obama on =
behalf of women and families=2E

Click here to watch the video: https://www=2Eyoutube=2Ecom/watch?v=3D5p=
eamRYpq0M

Finally, just before the holidays Congressman John Conyers, Jr=2E endor=
sed our campaign=2E
=20
As Co-founder and Dean of the Congressional Black Caucus, his endorseme=
nt is a huge win for the campaign!!

After nearly 10 months of staying focused and working hard, we have cap=
tured the momentum of this race=2E I hope I can continue to count on yo=
ur support in these last few and most important months before the elect=
ion=2E Stay tuned for more updates=2E

Thank you for all that you do,

Glenn
