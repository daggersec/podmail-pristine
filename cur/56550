t-power

By Alex Seitz-Wald
Allies of Hillary Clinton are working to bolster the former secretary of sta=
te=E2=80=99s foreign policy accomplishments after a recent interview erupted=
 into controversy over her worldview.

Correct the Record, the research and rapid response arm of a pro-Clinton sup=
er PAC, is equipping its surrogates and supporters Tuesday with a report and=
 talking points memo, shared with msnbc, that promote Clinton=E2=80=99s use o=
f =E2=80=9Csmart power.=E2=80=9D

It=E2=80=99s the latest in a series of reports the group regularly distribut=
es, all of which tout a different piece of Clinton=E2=80=99s record, from LG=
BT rights to income inequality to the environment.

=E2=80=9CSmart power=E2=80=9D was central to Clinton=E2=80=99s time at State=
, Correct the Record notes. An alternative to military action, Clinton viewe=
d the approach as the strategic deployment of a mix of economic, diplomatic,=
 political, legal, and cultural power, tailored to specific situations.

=E2=80=9CAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton utilized a combination of cr=
eative tools to achieve foreign policy goals as an alternative to unilateral=
 military action in many circumstances. This combination of diplomatic and e=
conomic tactics known as =E2=80=98smart power=E2=80=99 produced a number of r=
esults, ranging from strengthening our position with China to combating terr=
orism,=E2=80=9D Adrienne Elrod, Correct the Record=E2=80=99s communications d=
irector, told msnbc.

Last week, The Atlantic magazine published an interview in which Clinton cri=
ticized President Obama on foreign policy, producing some tension with Obama=
 loyalists and from some on the progressive left.

The Correct the Record report and talking points tout Clinton=E2=80=99s comm=
itment to =E2=80=9Csmart power,=E2=80=9D and give specific examples where th=
e approach =E2=80=9Cproduced results=E2=80=9D by =E2=80=9Crebuilding America=
=E2=80=99s standing in the world.=E2=80=9D

In Asia, for instance, the group says that Clinton=E2=80=99s approach helped=
 counterbalance China by strengthening alliances with smaller nations while a=
lso broadening relations with Beijing. In her new memoir, =E2=80=9CHard Choi=
ces,=E2=80=9D Clinton writes that she had multiple options on how to deal wi=
th China=E2=80=99s rise, but =E2=80=9Cdecided that the =E2=80=98smart power=E2=
=80=99 choice was to meld all three approaches.=E2=80=9D

To combat terrorism, her allies say Clinton used =E2=80=9Csmart power=E2=80=9D=
 to better engage technology,  to establish a global counterterrorism forum,=
 and to handle delicate relations with Pakistan and Afghanistan. The forum b=
rought together nations that did not have much in common, and may not have w=
anted to work together on other issues, but were willing to cooperate on the=
 narrow issue of counterterrorism.

To implement her vision, Correct the Record notes that Clinton took a page f=
rom the Defense Department by starting a Quadrennial Diplomacy and Developme=
nt Review =E2=80=93 a major State Department self-examination process that =E2=
=80=9Caimed to map out exactly how we would put smart power into practice.=E2=
=80=9D

If Clinton runs for president in 2016, she is expected to put her foreign po=
licy record and tenure as secretary of state front and center. Republicans h=
ave already tied to claim that Clinton did not accomplish much at Foggy Bott=
om, a notion Clinton allies like Correct the Record are hoping to nip in the=
 bud. Clinton has said she will decide on a run by the end of the year.

 the Senate Armed Services Committee, and it aimed to map out exactly how we=
 would put smart power into practice and use what I started calling =E2=80=98=
21st-Century Statecraft.=E2=80=99 This included harnessing new technologies,=
 public-private partnerships, diaspora networks, and other new tools, and it=

aron David Miller, =E2=80=9COf special note was the introduction of the Quad=

tion that=E2=80=99s risk adverse and conservative, with a culture that doesn=
=E2=80=99t reward planning and discourages change, this kind of coordination=
 and strategizing was monumental. The notion of a blueprint for highlighting=

ecretary Clinton wrote, =E2=80=9COne option was to focus on broadening our r=
elationship with China, on the theory that if we could get our China policy r=
ight, the rest of our work in Asia would be much easier. An alternative was t=
o concentrate our efforts on strengthening America=E2=80=99s treaty alliance=
s in the region (with Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, and Aus=
tralia), providing a counterbalance to China=E2=80=99s growing power. A thir=
d approach was to elevate and harmonize the alphabet soup of regional multil=
ateral organizations, such as ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nati=
ons) and APEC (the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization). [=E2=80=A6=
] In keeping with the position I had staked out as a Senator and Presidentia=
l candidate, I decided that the smart power choice was to meld all three app=
roaches. We would show that America was =E2=80=98all in=E2=80=99 when it cam=
e to Asia. I was prepared to lead the way, but success would require buy-in f=
