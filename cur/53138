Cool.
I think this meeting is all the more urgent because the circular firing
squads will unleash tomorrow and there will be a smorgasbord of
over-interpretations.  I'm already hearing the modeling people say that TV
doesn't work and the TV people saying analytics doesn't work.  And I'm sure
someone tomorrow will say campaigning on women's issues doesn't work.  It
all still works and the dynamics of 16 will be completely different...I
would be way more prospective than retrospective.  My two cents.
