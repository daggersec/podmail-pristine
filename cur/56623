Sorry
Anyway what do we think about using gridiron to puncture the email story a l=
ittle.  Maybe have Terry do in his speech - photos of emails from her to Jeb=
 at his personal address, Jason Chatez at his gmail, maybe a photo of her su=
rrounded by a pile of phones to make fun of the one device defense.  That ki=
nd of thing.  For HRC to get credit for it, she would need to appear in at l=
east one photo.  What do you think?=20
