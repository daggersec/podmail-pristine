John,

I now understand that the trouble is not the choice questionnaire but the c=
ontract and the partnership with EMILY's List.  Sadly this was not made cle=
ar until today.  Below we have pared down what we need and what we are will=
ing to give =97 which is the first time in 30 years we have done this.  I b=
elieve it is the right thing to do, but as you know, this partnership is ab=
out electing Hillary to the Presidency and the history of the women's polit=
ical movement of the last 30 years and the next 30 years.  We have been not=
hing but supportive both with staff resources and independent research over=
 the last year and intend not to only continue being at the campaign's serv=
ice and bundling millions of dollars over the next two years, but also, doi=
ng millions and millions of independent expenditure work.  Hillary has also=
 been incredibly supportive by attending our gala and being a champion of w=
omen leaders.  Please help us maintain this partnership so EMILY's List can=
 continue its great work in the next 19 months and the years to come when w=
e need to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate, win House races, ta=
ke back legislatures, and move forward as a nation under Hillary's leadersh=
ip.

What can I do to make this happen?  My staff is debating with Denis with mu=
ch trouble.  This isn't just about money though, it is about the partnershi=
p and I worry that is getting lost by both sides of negotiators, thus, I am=
 emailing you.

Respectfully,
Stephanie

Hi Guys,

So we've tried to pare this down to bare bones here to move things forward.=
 We cannot give everything for nothing, that's not how EMILY's List has ope=
rated for 30 years. For us to be around another 30, and for us to elect a C=
ongress Hillary will be able to work with, we have to come closer on some o=
f this.

And I know you know, that we're talking about a long-standing, multi-year r=
elationship with EMILY's List and Hillary. Already,  EMILY's List has spent=
 and raised nearly a million dollars on HRC research, which Robby knows. We=
're invested in raising her money and electing her the next President. We a=
dd value to campaigns and we will to yours.

Here's what I would propose:

- We will provide email addresses on HRC/EL digital donors during the cycle=
. We're asking a 1:1 exchange of similar-type-donors* post-election for dig=
ital emails. In the same way that you will be unsuppressed with the donors =
thru the cycle, we'd like that post-election for donors given to us.

- We'd like confirmation of approval and payment of HRC urgent gram to drop=
 1-week following announcement.

- During cycle, we'd like 1 signed hit for dm and digital by HRC or WJC to =
EL lists.


-As mentioned above, we will eliminate suppression restrictions for HRC in =
contract. Similarly, we would like no restrictions on post-election solicit=
ations of digital or dm HRC exchange donors.


- Post election, we'd like 1 signed hit for dm and digital by HRC or WJC to=
 EL lists.

*For example, if we get one maxed our donor at $2,700, then you give us the=
 information for one maxed out donor at $2,700.  If we give one donor that =
gives multiple small dollar contributions, then we will need one donor that=
 gave multiple small dollar.

I'm a around to discuss and Dennis I will call you. Thanks I know how craze=
d things must be. Jess
