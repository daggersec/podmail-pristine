Dear Mary,

I wanted to share with you all a special message from Amy Goldsmith, our Ne=
w Jersey director, on what is happening there. New Jersey has been an impor=
tant part of the Clean Water family, often leading the way in making our en=
vironment and water safer =E2=80=93 and now they need our help after Hurric=
ane Sandy.=20

If you can consider a special tax deductible gift to our emergency fund tod=
ay [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/co=
ntent?content_item_KEY=3D12112 ] to help New Jersey get back on its feet, w=
e would be very grateful.

Thanks for all that you do.

Bob

Just over two weeks ago, Hurricane Sandy pounded the Eastern Seaboard, leav=
ing a wake of destruction in its path. Thousands of people are still withou=
t water, heat and power and countless more are stranded without a home or b=
usiness to go back to =E2=80=93 including those who worked in our Belmar of=
fice. *You can help* [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/we=
b/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=3D12112 ]* us get our Belmar staff=
 back to doing what they do best =E2=80=93 fighting for clean water =E2=80=
=93 with a **special tax deductible gift* [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.=
org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=3D12112 ]* to=
day!*

For over 30 years, Belmar has been the home of the New Jersey Environmental=
 Federation (NJEF), the New Jersey office of Clean Water Fund. Our office w=
as a block from the beach - and we were hit hard by Sandy. The office was u=
nderwater during the storm and cannot be salvaged. Our staff in Belmar, lik=
e many other New Jerseyans, are trying to get back on their feet, but the i=
mpacts of the super-storm and subsequent Nor'easter are far from over. We n=
eed you now =E2=80=93 join hundreds of Clean Water Action staff and members=
 from across the country by making a special tax deductible gift [ http://s=
alsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/salsa/web/common/public/content?content=
_item_KEY=3D12112 ] today.

*We have hope. *We are extremely grateful that our staff, board and members=
 are safe and that our neighbors are as well. We are also thankful for the =
numerous volunteers, both in and out of state, working to put New Jersey ba=
ck together. We will rebuild the Garden State and the Shore and make it a h=
ealthy, clean, and wonderful place to live, work and raise our families.=20

As we help others rebuild, your help is needed to relocate our State Office=
 to a new space not too far away, in Long Branch. Unfortunately, we are not=
 eligible for flood insurance, and other forms of assistance are limited.=

*Please help us rebuild* [ http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/2155/p/sals=
a/web/common/public/content?content_item_KEY=3D12112 ].

Our staff and volunteers are eager to get back to protecting our water supp=
lies, environment, communities and public health. For 30 years we've taken =
action for clean water in New Jersey and we're not going to let a hurricane=
 stop us. In order to start fighting again, we need the basics for a modern=
 office =E2=80=93 office supplies, professional quality office furniture, a=
 new phone system, computers, printers, copier and more. But, most importan=
tly, we need you =E2=80=93 can you make a special relief gift today? [ http=
