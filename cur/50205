John --

I've always said that 2008 was an amazing journey. But nothing from that =
election struck me more than seeing so many giving their time and lending =
their voices because they were ready for change.

Two years ago, in state after state -- no matter where I went -- I saw =
grandmothers out canvassing, college kids traveling to swing states and =
sleeping on gymnasium floors, and people using their lunch breaks to make =
a few more calls. So many got involved for the very first time, each one =
bringing others along with them.

It was inspiring to witness.

Now, Barack and I need you to help show that energy again. Because this is =
such a critical moment, a group of grassroots donors are ready to match =
any contribution you can give.

Across the country, teachers and firefighters, truckers and nurses have =
made pledges of support hoping to inspire you to take the next step. =
Because of them, a $3 contribution will become $6.

Donate today and answer your fellow supporter's pledge to match whatever =
you can give:

https://donate.barackobama.com/MichelleMatch5

Here's how it works:

-- You choose the amount you are able to give and another supporter =
willing to match that amount doubles it.

-- You can choose to write a note to the individual who matched your =
donation and tell them why you decided to own a piece of this movement.

Since the day Barack announced his plan to run for office, supporters like =
you have made everything we've achieved possible.

That's as true now as it was on Election Day in 2008.

You're the reason we reformed a health care system that was broken, =
progress that means so much to so many. You're the reason we reined in =
Wall Street banks that were out of control.

But Barack can't keep making progress without strong allies in Congress. =
And now the same people who've opposed us at every turn are targeting the =
folks who voted to make change real. They think we can't do it again.

But they're wrong.

If the folks who I saw in 2008 -- those of you who packed up your bags and =
slept on floors and made calls and talked to voters day after day -- are =
ready to stand with us again, then I'm ready for any challenge that lies =
ahead.

That's why we're asking you to help grow this movement once again.

The plan for this election is based on the lessons we learned two years =
ago. Our organizers and volunteers are knocking on doors every weekend, =
making calls every night. Your support will help to fund this work.

Another supporter is asking you to join them today -- and has pledged to =
match whatever you can give.

Please donate $3 or more to help grow this movement before November 2nd:

https://donate.barackobama.com/MichelleMatch5

Thank you,

Michelle Obama
