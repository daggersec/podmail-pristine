John,

Mike Dorning here from Bloomberg. Just thought I would pass on that my
colleague Peter Gosselin was laid off yesterday.

I think Secretary Clinton has some affection for him. She delivered the
keynote this year at the annual scholarship presentation memorializing his
late wife, Robin Toner, and spoke at length about Peter and Robin.

Just thought I would pass that along, in case someone wanted to reach out
to him. You're one of the few people I know in Clinton-land. Peter's
personal email is peterggosselin@gmail.com, though presumably whoever
handled arrangements for the speech has more complete contact information.

Hope all well with you.

Best,

Mike
